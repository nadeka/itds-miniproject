L8208	u121	m7	RICK	Then we'll stay up together.
L8207	u115	m7	ALICE	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
L8206	u121	m7	RICK	We'll figure it out.
L8204	u121	m7	RICK	I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
L8203	u115	m7	ALICE	I can't go back to sleep again.
L8202	u121	m7	RICK	Yeah, or turn you into toast.
L8201	u115	m7	ALICE	It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
L8200	u121	m7	RICK	Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
L8199	u115	m7	ALICE	I can't find him.
L8198	u121	m7	RICK	Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
L8197	u115	m7	ALICE	It was bad.
L8196	u121	m7	RICK	I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
L8156	u115	m7	ALICE	Kristen...
L8155	u121	m7	RICK	You alright?
L8097	u115	m7	ALICE	What?
L8096	u121	m7	RICK	Kincaid and Joey died last night.
L8095	u115	m7	ALICE	What's wrong?
L8094	u121	m7	RICK	Alice, you think you can leave?
L8037	u121	m7	RICK	Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
L8036	u115	m7	ALICE	Rick...I can't.
L8035	u121	m7	RICK	Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
L8034	u115	m7	ALICE	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
L8033	u121	m7	RICK	Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
L8032	u115	m7	ALICE	I don't want to.
L8031	u121	m7	RICK	The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
L8030	u115	m7	ALICE	What?
L8029	u121	m7	RICK	Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
L8101	u119	m7	KRISTEN	You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
L8100	u115	m7	ALICE	Kristen, what happened?
L8063	u119	m7	KRISTEN	When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
L8062	u115	m7	ALICE	You what?
L8060	u115	m7	ALICE	When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
L8059	u119	m7	KRISTEN	How'd you learn so much about dreams?
L8058	u115	m7	ALICE	I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
L8057	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
L8056	u115	m7	ALICE	No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
L8055	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Sounds like a game show host to me.
L8054	u115	m7	ALICE	My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
L8053	u119	m7	KRISTEN	You could do worse.
L8052	u115	m7	ALICE	I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
L8051	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
L8050	u115	m7	ALICE	I'm sure they're around.
L8049	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
L8048	u115	m7	ALICE	Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
L8179	u122	m7	SHEILA	Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
L8178	u115	m7	ALICE	Then you saw him, too?
L8177	u122	m7	SHEILA	That obvious, huh?
L8176	u115	m7	ALICE	You've been up all night?
L8175	u122	m7	SHEILA	What?
L8174	u115	m7	ALICE	We have matching luggage.
L8173	u122	m7	SHEILA	Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
L8087	u115	m7	ALICE	I know.
L8086	u122	m7	SHEILA	Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
L8085	u115	m7	ALICE	I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
L8084	u122	m7	SHEILA	I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
L8083	u115	m7	ALICE	You in a hurry?
L8324	u115	m7	ALICE	Save it for later.  Come on!
L8323	u116	m7	DAN	You look great!
L8295	u115	m7	ALICE	Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
L8294	u116	m7	DAN	What the hell was that?
L8290	u116	m7	DAN	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
L8289	u115	m7	ALICE	Here we are.
L8288	u116	m7	DAN	You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
L8287	u115	m7	ALICE	He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
L8278	u115	m7	ALICE	It's okay, we're just about there.
L8277	u116	m7	DAN	As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
L8276	u116	m7	DAN	Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
L8275	u115	m7	ALICE	You just feel sorry for me.
L8274	u116	m7	DAN	Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
L8273	u115	m7	ALICE	He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
L8255	u116	m7	DAN	Who?
L8254	u115	m7	ALICE	Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
L8253	u116	m7	DAN	Then what else can we do?
L8252	u115	m7	ALICE	Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
L8251	u116	m7	DAN	Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
L8250	u115	m7	ALICE	You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
L8248	u115	m7	ALICE	I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
L8247	u116	m7	DAN	Is there something we can do?
L8246	u115	m7	ALICE	Not really.
L8218	u115	m7	ALICE	Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
L8217	u116	m7	DAN	Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
L8216	u115	m7	ALICE	Three days.
L8215	u116	m7	DAN	How long have you been awake?
L8214	u115	m7	ALICE	The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
L8213	u116	m7	DAN	No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
L8212	u115	m7	ALICE	Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
L8211	u116	m7	DAN	Extra money, huh?
L8210	u115	m7	ALICE	I've been working double shifts.
L8190	u116	m7	DAN	Kristen's story really got to her.
L8189	u115	m7	ALICE	No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
L8166	u116	m7	DAN	In her dream?
L8165	u115	m7	ALICE	I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
L8162	u115	m7	ALICE	It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
L8161	u116	m7	DAN	I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
L8080	u115	m7	ALICE	I know.  Uh...Alice.
L8079	u116	m7	DAN	Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
L8078	u115	m7	ALICE	Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
L8077	u116	m7	DAN	You're his sister, right?
L8076	u115	m7	ALICE	No...
L8187	u115	m7	ALICE	I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
L8186	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Enough of that crap.
L8185	u115	m7	ALICE	It was Freddy.
L8184	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
L8092	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
L8091	u115	m7	ALICE	I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
L7996	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Alright, I think I see salvation...
L7995	u115	m7	ALICE	Rick, please.
L8229	u121	m7	RICK	What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
L8228	u116	m7	DAN	About Freddy?
L8227	u121	m7	RICK	She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
L8226	u116	m7	DAN	How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
L8225	u121	m7	RICK	Been up with Alice.
L8159	u121	m7	RICK	She knew she was gonna die.
L8158	u116	m7	DAN	Hey man, we're all sorry...
L8126	u121	m7	RICK	Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
L8125	u116	m7	DAN	Nice neighborhood.
L8124	u121	m7	RICK	It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
L8123	u116	m7	DAN	So?
L8122	u121	m7	RICK	She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
L8121	u116	m7	DAN	So what's up?  What'd I miss?
L8120	u121	m7	RICK	Let me talk to you.
L8119	u116	m7	DAN	I don't get it.
L8099	u121	m7	RICK	Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
L8098	u116	m7	DAN	Hey, Rick!
L7994	u121	m7	RICK	Earth to Alice...
L7993	u116	m7	DAN	T-T-Thanks Alice...
L8143	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
L8142	u118	m7	ELAINE	Honey, we went over this in therapy.
L8141	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
L8140	u118	m7	ELAINE	I'm sorry honey, but...
L8138	u118	m7	ELAINE	Your distraught.  It'll help...
L8137	u119	m7	KRISTEN	What's wrong with me?
L8136	u118	m7	ELAINE	You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
L8135	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
L8134	u118	m7	ELAINE	Something the matter with the cuisine?
L8118	u119	m7	KRISTEN	I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
L8117	u121	m7	RICK	It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
L8116	u119	m7	KRISTEN	It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
L8115	u121	m7	RICK	I'll tell you later.
L8106	u119	m7	KRISTEN	It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
L8105	u121	m7	RICK	I though Freddy was just an old town story.
L8104	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
L8065	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Oh God!  He killed them!
L8064	u121	m7	RICK	What is it?
L7984	u121	m7	RICK	When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
L7983	u119	m7	KRISTEN	What?
L7982	u121	m7	RICK	Avoid-all-contact-day.
L7981	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Something wrong with the stairs?
L8072	u120	m7	NURSE	Don't worry, honey
L8071	u119	m7	KRISTEN	You don't get it, he's after me...
L8070	u120	m7	NURSE	You just stay put.  You need rest.
L8069	u119	m7	KRISTEN	I gotta get out of here.
L8068	u120	m7	NURSE	You had a nasty bump.
L8067	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
L8066	u120	m7	NURSE	Feeling better now?
L8729	u123	m8	ALICE	You're not taking my baby!
L8728	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
L8725	u123	m8	ALICE	"What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?..."
L8724	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
L8722	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	And ours.  It's our grandchild.
L8721	u123	m8	ALICE	Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
L8718	u123	m8	ALICE	What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
L8717	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
L8420	u123	m8	ALICE	It's okay, Dan
L8419	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	Excuse us, dear.
L8806	u127	m8	JACOB	He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
L8805	u123	m8	ALICE	But how...?
L8804	u127	m8	JACOB	It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
L8803	u123	m8	ALICE	What do you mean?
L8802	u127	m8	JACOB	He's inside you, where he hides.
L8801	u123	m8	ALICE	Where is he?
L8793	u123	m8	ALICE	Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
L8792	u127	m8	JACOB	Mommy...?
L8657	u127	m8	JACOB	My friend, with the funny hand.
L8656	u123	m8	ALICE	Who says I don't like you?
L8654	u123	m8	ALICE	Who said I...wait, what?
L8653	u127	m8	JACOB	No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
L8652	u123	m8	ALICE	Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
L8651	u127	m8	JACOB	She doesn't want me around
L8650	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
L8649	u127	m8	JACOB	No...
L8648	u123	m8	ALICE	Is that who you're waiting for?
L8645	u127	m8	JACOB	Been having bad dreams.
L8644	u123	m8	ALICE	Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
L8543	u127	m8	JACOB	I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
L8542	u123	m8	ALICE	How did you know that?
L8541	u127	m8	JACOB	I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
L8540	u123	m8	ALICE	My name is...
L8539	u127	m8	JACOB	It's lonely in there, in my room.
L8538	u123	m8	ALICE	Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
L8536	u123	m8	ALICE	Huh?
L8535	u127	m8	JACOB	Hey...wake up.
L8414	u123	m8	ALICE	Me too.
L8413	u125	m8	DAN	There you go.  Love you.
L8412	u123	m8	ALICE	You're right.
L8411	u125	m8	DAN	You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
L8410	u123	m8	ALICE	Yeah...I guess.
L8409	u125	m8	DAN	You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
L8408	u123	m8	ALICE	No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
L8407	u125	m8	DAN	About him?
L8405	u125	m8	DAN	He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
L8404	u123	m8	ALICE	Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
L8403	u125	m8	DAN	Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
L8402	u123	m8	ALICE	I know.
L8401	u125	m8	DAN	They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
L8400	u123	m8	ALICE	The tickets.
L8397	u125	m8	DAN	Sorry, babe.
L8396	u123	m8	ALICE	Jesus!  Don't do that!
L8395	u125	m8	DAN	Hi, beautiful.
L8783	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Now.
L8782	u123	m8	ALICE	But Dad --
L8781	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
L8780	u123	m8	ALICE	I've got to go.
L8779	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Alice!
L8580	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
L8579	u123	m8	ALICE	You disappointed in me?
L8578	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Since my little girl became a mom...
L8577	u123	m8	ALICE	Since when are you such a smart shopper?
L8576	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Alice...
L8575	u123	m8	ALICE	Very funny.
L8574	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Sobering...
L8573	u123	m8	ALICE	How was the meeting?
L8525	u123	m8	ALICE	Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
L8524	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	I'm so sorry, honey...
L8451	u123	m8	ALICE	It's just across the park.
L8450	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
L8449	u123	m8	ALICE	Thanks for everything, Dad.
L8447	u123	m8	ALICE	To take a picture.
L8446	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Where are we going?
L8444	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
L8443	u123	m8	ALICE	Dad!
L8442	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	No.  A deal's a deal.
L8441	u123	m8	ALICE	That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
L8440	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."
L8439	u123	m8	ALICE	I was afraid you weren't coming.
L8819	u123	m8	ALICE	That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
L8818	u130	m8	YVONNE	He sure loves to stay awake.
L8817	u123	m8	ALICE	So did Dan.
L8816	u130	m8	YVONNE	You do good work, Alice.
L8778	u123	m8	ALICE	We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
L8777	u130	m8	YVONNE	But how are we gonna --
L8776	u123	m8	ALICE	Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
L8775	u130	m8	YVONNE	What?
L8770	u123	m8	ALICE	If they actually bothered to bury her.
L8769	u130	m8	YVONNE	You think that's the place she's buried?
L8760	u130	m8	YVONNE	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
L8759	u123	m8	ALICE	Are you alright?
L8705	u123	m8	ALICE	That's the only reason you're alive...
L8704	u130	m8	YVONNE	Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
L8700	u123	m8	ALICE	Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
L8699	u130	m8	YVONNE	All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
L8698	u123	m8	ALICE	What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
L8697	u130	m8	YVONNE	And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
L8696	u123	m8	ALICE	Krueger is reality.
L8695	u130	m8	YVONNE	I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
L8677	u123	m8	ALICE	I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
L8676	u130	m8	YVONNE	I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
L8675	u123	m8	ALICE	Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
L8674	u130	m8	YVONNE	Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
L8673	u123	m8	ALICE	I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
L8672	u130	m8	YVONNE	You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
L8621	u130	m8	YVONNE	Why don't you two stick to reality.
L8620	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
L8614	u123	m8	ALICE	No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
L8613	u130	m8	YVONNE	It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
L8565	u130	m8	YVONNE	When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
L8564	u123	m8	ALICE	What's that got to do with it?
L8552	u130	m8	YVONNE	They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
L8551	u123	m8	ALICE	Did everyone call everyone?
L8547	u123	m8	ALICE	He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
L8546	u130	m8	YVONNE	There aren't any little boys on your floor.
L8545	u123	m8	ALICE	Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
L8523	u130	m8	YVONNE	Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
L8522	u123	m8	ALICE	It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
L8394	u130	m8	YVONNE	Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
L8393	u123	m8	ALICE	Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
L8365	u123	m8	ALICE	No, the Dan part was nice...
L8364	u130	m8	YVONNE	Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
L8363	u123	m8	ALICE	Had kind of a long night.
L8362	u130	m8	YVONNE	Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
L8743	u128	m8	MARK	She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
L8742	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't understand.
L8741	u128	m8	MARK	No shit.
L8740	u123	m8	ALICE	Poor woman...
L8739	u128	m8	MARK	Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
L8738	u123	m8	ALICE	But I've seen her grave.
L8737	u128	m8	MARK	They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
L8736	u123	m8	ALICE	Meaning?
L8735	u128	m8	MARK	That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
L8734	u123	m8	ALICE	No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
L8733	u128	m8	MARK	That's their problem.
L8732	u123	m8	ALICE	They think I'm nuts.
L8711	u128	m8	MARK	Then we'll find another way.
L8710	u123	m8	ALICE	I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
L8671	u128	m8	MARK	I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
L8670	u123	m8	ALICE	Where are you going?
L8668	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't know!
L8667	u128	m8	MARK	Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
L8665	u128	m8	MARK	What, you named it already?
L8664	u123	m8	ALICE	My baby!
L8663	u128	m8	MARK	Who's Jacob?
L8640	u123	m8	ALICE	Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
L8639	u128	m8	MARK	Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
L8638	u123	m8	ALICE	It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
L8637	u128	m8	MARK	Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
L8634	u123	m8	ALICE	Nobody thinks that.
L8633	u128	m8	MARK	Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
L8627	u123	m8	ALICE	Mark!
L8626	u128	m8	MARK	Then get out!
L8617	u123	m8	ALICE	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
L8616	u128	m8	MARK	I thought about that.
L8612	u128	m8	MARK	I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
L8611	u123	m8	ALICE	I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
L8610	u128	m8	MARK	Yeah.  I'm just aces.
L8609	u123	m8	ALICE	Mark, are you okay?
L8557	u123	m8	ALICE	That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
L8556	u128	m8	MARK	I've got to write some of this down.
L8424	u128	m8	MARK	Well we gotta do something!
L8423	u123	m8	ALICE	My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
L8383	u128	m8	MARK	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
L8382	u123	m8	ALICE	Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
L8377	u128	m8	MARK	I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
L8376	u123	m8	ALICE	Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
L8495	u126	m8	GRETA	I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
L8494	u128	m8	MARK	Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
L8490	u128	m8	MARK	Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
L8489	u126	m8	GRETA	Who?
L8488	u128	m8	MARK	He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
L8422	u126	m8	GRETA	You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
L8421	u128	m8	MARK	That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
L8381	u126	m8	GRETA	Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
L8380	u128	m8	MARK	Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
L8375	u128	m8	MARK	My undying love.  Have some.
L8374	u126	m8	GRETA	Next life.  Oh, what's that?
L8373	u128	m8	MARK	Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
L8571	u130	m8	YVONNE	All of us.  Right?
L8570	u126	m8	GRETA	Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
L8563	u126	m8	GRETA	Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
L8562	u130	m8	YVONNE	Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
L8559	u126	m8	GRETA	I want to talk about the baby.
L8558	u130	m8	YVONNE	Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
L8484	u126	m8	GRETA	Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
L8483	u130	m8	YVONNE	Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
L8482	u126	m8	GRETA	Have another one, sounds like you need it.
L8427	u130	m8	YVONNE	That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
L8426	u126	m8	GRETA	Yeah...
L8425	u130	m8	YVONNE	All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
L8367	u130	m8	YVONNE	Makes you look like a nun--
L8366	u126	m8	GRETA	These things are wild...  What do you think?
L8703	u128	m8	MARK	He invited me to his house last night.
L8702	u130	m8	YVONNE	You, too?
L8630	u128	m8	MARK	Stick around, please?
L8629	u130	m8	YVONNE	It's okay.
L8625	u130	m8	YVONNE	I can't listen to this.
L8624	u128	m8	MARK	I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
L8623	u130	m8	YVONNE	Mark...
L8622	u128	m8	MARK	Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
L8499	u128	m8	MARK	Faint.
L8498	u130	m8	YVONNE	Vomit?
L8481	u130	m8	YVONNE	Two hours a day, six days a week.
L8480	u128	m8	MARK	Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
L31667	u269	m17	ALEX	Thank you.
L31666	u280	m17	ORDERLY	I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
L31665	u269	m17	ALEX	You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
L31664	u280	m17	ORDERLY	What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
L31663	u269	m17	ALEX	How did he look?
L31662	u280	m17	ORDERLY	The American? Yes, duck.
L31661	u269	m17	ALEX	Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
L32200	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I doubt it. But it's something to do.
L32199	u269	m17	ALEX	David?
L32198	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
L32135	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Tea would be nice.
L32134	u269	m17	ALEX	What shall we do?
L32060	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I expect you shortly.
L32059	u269	m17	ALEX	No, a cab will be faster.
L32058	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Shall I send a car?
L32057	u269	m17	ALEX	He's fine. We'll come right over.
L32056	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
L32055	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, Doctor.
L32054	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
L32053	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, I should think so.
L32052	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Could you get here without any trouble?
L32051	u269	m17	ALEX	No, not really.
L32050	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Is David acting strangely?
L32049	u269	m17	ALEX	No, why?
L32048	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
L32047	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
L32046	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	The zoo? Is he rational?
L32045	u269	m17	ALEX	He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
L32044	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
L32043	u269	m17	ALEX	He's here.
L31993	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
L31992	u269	m17	ALEX	What shall we do?
L31991	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
L31990	u269	m17	ALEX	Dr. Hirsch?
L31989	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
L31988	u269	m17	ALEX	Surely you're not suggesting...
L31987	u269	m17	ALEX	No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
L31986	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
L31985	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
L31984	u269	m17	ALEX	And what else?
L31983	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
L31982	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes.
L31981	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
L31980	u269	m17	ALEX	Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
L31979	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Warn him?
L31978	u269	m17	ALEX	David says Jack comes to warn him.
L31977	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	What did he say?
L31976	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes.
L31975	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Has his friend appeared to him again?
L31974	u269	m17	ALEX	Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
L31973	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
L31972	u269	m17	ALEX	He's not?
L31969	u269	m17	ALEX	At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
L31968	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	It's a full moon. Where is he?
L31967	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, sir.
L31966	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
L31962	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Come to my office, Miss Price.
L31961	u269	m17	ALEX	It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
L31591	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, I believe he did.
L31590	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Did he say a wolf?
L31557	u269	m17	ALEX	No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
L31556	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
L31555	u269	m17	ALEX	What happened to them?
L31554	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
L31553	u269	m17	ALEX	He said 'Jack'.
L31552	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	What exactly did he call out?
L31551	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, Doctor?
L31550	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Oh, Miss Price?
L31549	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, Doctor.
L31548	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Go about your duties.
L31547	u269	m17	ALEX	Dr. Hirsch?
L31546	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Can I be of service, Miss Price?
L31542	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
L31541	u269	m17	ALEX	Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
L32119	u274	m17	DAVID	Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
L32118	u269	m17	ALEX	David, don't lose control.
L32117	u274	m17	DAVID	Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
L32116	u269	m17	ALEX	David, let's go now.
L32115	u274	m17	DAVID	Hopeless. It's hopeless.
L32106	u274	m17	DAVID	Will you shut up!?!!
L32105	u269	m17	ALEX	Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
L32093	u274	m17	DAVID	I swear, I don't know this girl.
L32092	u269	m17	ALEX	We had an argument. He's being silly.
L32091	u274	m17	DAVID	What?
L32090	u269	m17	ALEX	He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
L32087	u274	m17	DAVID	Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
L32086	u269	m17	ALEX	David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
L32085	u274	m17	DAVID	Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
L32084	u269	m17	ALEX	Jack is dead!
L32083	u274	m17	DAVID	I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
L32082	u269	m17	ALEX	David, stop!
L32081	u274	m17	DAVID	Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
L32080	u269	m17	ALEX	David, what are you doing?
L32077	u274	m17	DAVID	Pull over.
L32076	u269	m17	ALEX	But...
L32065	u274	m17	DAVID	I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
L32064	u269	m17	ALEX	Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
L32063	u274	m17	DAVID	I should be committed.
L32062	u269	m17	ALEX	The next corner we can get a cab.
L32037	u274	m17	DAVID	I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
L32036	u269	m17	ALEX	Don't you remember?
L32035	u274	m17	DAVID	Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
L32034	u269	m17	ALEX	The zoo?
L32033	u274	m17	DAVID	Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
L32032	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm freezing.
L32031	u269	m17	ALEX	David! Where on earth have you been!?!
L31919	u274	m17	DAVID	See you later.
L31918	u269	m17	ALEX	I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
L31917	u274	m17	DAVID	A doper werewolf.
L31916	u269	m17	ALEX	I've left those pills for you.
L31915	u274	m17	DAVID	Okay.
L31914	u269	m17	ALEX	Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
L31913	u274	m17	DAVID	Yeah, I do, but go to work.
L31912	u269	m17	ALEX	David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
L31911	u274	m17	DAVID	Werewolves simply do not exist.
L31910	u269	m17	ALEX	It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
L31909	u274	m17	DAVID	Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
L31908	u269	m17	ALEX	Anything.
L31907	u274	m17	DAVID	Do me an enormous favor?
L31906	u269	m17	ALEX	Let me go now, you'll make me late.
L31852	u274	m17	DAVID	That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
L31851	u269	m17	ALEX	Tomorrow is the full moon.
L31850	u274	m17	DAVID	I wasn't hallucinating.
L31849	u269	m17	ALEX	But, David.
L31848	u274	m17	DAVID	I was awake and he was in my room.
L31847	u269	m17	ALEX	David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
L31846	u274	m17	DAVID	Good.
L31845	u269	m17	ALEX	Of course.
L31844	u274	m17	DAVID	Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
L31843	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes?
L31842	u274	m17	DAVID	Alex?
L31841	u269	m17	ALEX	It's nice to see you.
L31840	u274	m17	DAVID	It's nice to see you.
L31839	u269	m17	ALEX	David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
L31838	u274	m17	DAVID	There is only one bed.
L31837	u269	m17	ALEX	The bedroom.
L31836	u274	m17	DAVID	Lovely.
L31835	u269	m17	ALEX	Bathroom.
L31834	u274	m17	DAVID	Charming.
L31833	u269	m17	ALEX	Closet.
L31832	u274	m17	DAVID	Very nice.
L31831	u269	m17	ALEX	The kitchen.
L31829	u274	m17	DAVID	Yeah, I would think so, too.
L31828	u269	m17	ALEX	I would think so.
L31827	u274	m17	DAVID	I was dreaming again?
L31826	u269	m17	ALEX	What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
L31825	u274	m17	DAVID	Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
L31824	u269	m17	ALEX	Your dead friend Jack?
L31823	u274	m17	DAVID	My friend Jack was just here.
L31822	u269	m17	ALEX	You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
L31821	u274	m17	DAVID	I'll let you know the next full moon.
L31820	u269	m17	ALEX	Are you better now?
L31819	u269	m17	ALEX	A werewolf?
L31818	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm a werewolf.
L31758	u269	m17	ALEX	Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
L31757	u274	m17	DAVID	Now I'm embarrassed.
L31756	u269	m17	ALEX	All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
L31755	u274	m17	DAVID	Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
L31754	u269	m17	ALEX	You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
L31753	u274	m17	DAVID	Not just a patient -- me.
L31752	u269	m17	ALEX	How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
L31751	u274	m17	DAVID	Will you think about it?
L31750	u269	m17	ALEX	Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
L31749	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
L31748	u269	m17	ALEX	What?
L31747	u274	m17	DAVID	Will you come with me?
L31746	u269	m17	ALEX	David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
L31745	u274	m17	DAVID	I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
L31744	u269	m17	ALEX	That's easy enough.
L31743	u274	m17	DAVID	No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
L31742	u269	m17	ALEX	Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
L31741	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm sorry I woke you up.
L31740	u269	m17	ALEX	Hello. You all right?
L31736	u269	m17	ALEX	Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
L31735	u274	m17	DAVID	Yes, go on.
L31734	u269	m17	ALEX	A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
L31733	u274	m17	DAVID	What? Oh, yes, please.
L31732	u269	m17	ALEX	Shall I read to you?
L31731	u274	m17	DAVID	My best friend. My very best friend.
L31730	u269	m17	ALEX	Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
L31729	u274	m17	DAVID	Now what do you want to talk about?
L31728	u269	m17	ALEX	I know.
L31727	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm twenty-seven.
L31726	u269	m17	ALEX	Twenty-eight.
L31725	u274	m17	DAVID	How old are you?
L31724	u269	m17	ALEX	That's not really a very proper question.
L31723	u274	m17	DAVID	How old are you?
L31722	u274	m17	DAVID	It's okay. I want to talk to you.
L31721	u269	m17	ALEX	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
L31720	u274	m17	DAVID	I dream of death mostly.
L31719	u269	m17	ALEX	What do you dream about?
L31718	u269	m17	ALEX	I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
L31717	u274	m17	DAVID	Do you like it?
L31716	u269	m17	ALEX	'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
L31715	u274	m17	DAVID	I was. What are you reading?
L31714	u269	m17	ALEX	I thought you were asleep.
L31713	u274	m17	DAVID	You're a very beautiful girl.
L31688	u274	m17	DAVID	Will you give me a break?
L31687	u269	m17	ALEX	Let's try a little harder, shall we?
L31686	u269	m17	ALEX	Right.
L31685	u274	m17	DAVID	This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
L31684	u269	m17	ALEX	Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
L31683	u274	m17	DAVID	Call me David.
L31682	u269	m17	ALEX	Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
L31681	u274	m17	DAVID	Aw come on, Alex!
L31680	u269	m17	ALEX	Call me Alex.
L31679	u274	m17	DAVID	Aw come on, Miss Price!
L31678	u269	m17	ALEX	Sorry.
L31677	u274	m17	DAVID	Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
L31676	u269	m17	ALEX	Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
L31675	u274	m17	DAVID	How is that?
L31674	u269	m17	ALEX	You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
L31673	u274	m17	DAVID	Please, really. I'm not hungry.
L31672	u269	m17	ALEX	I'm afraid you have to eat something.
L31671	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm not very hungry, thank you.
L31670	u269	m17	ALEX	You haven't eaten your lunch.
L31669	u274	m17	DAVID	Yes?
L31668	u269	m17	ALEX	Mr. Kessler?
L31589	u274	m17	DAVID	A wolf.
L31588	u269	m17	ALEX	What?
L31587	u274	m17	DAVID	It was a wolf.
L31586	u269	m17	ALEX	I beg your pardon?
L31585	u274	m17	DAVID	It wasn't a lunatic.
L31935	u269	m17	ALEX	I thought not.
L31934	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No.
L31933	u269	m17	ALEX	Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
L31932	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No!
L31931	u269	m17	ALEX	No what?
L31930	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No.
L31929	u269	m17	ALEX	How are we feeling tonight?
L31660	u269	m17	ALEX	Right.
L31659	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No.
L31658	u269	m17	ALEX	The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
L31657	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No.
L31656	u269	m17	ALEX	Feeling better?
L31655	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No.
L31654	u269	m17	ALEX	Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
L31653	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No.
L31652	u269	m17	ALEX	No what?
L31651	u270	m17	BENJAMIN	No.
L31650	u269	m17	ALEX	Hello, Benjamin.
L31539	u269	m17	ALEX	Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
L31538	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	I looked.
L31537	u269	m17	ALEX	Why on earth do you say that?
L31536	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	I think he's a Jew.
L31535	u269	m17	ALEX	Chart says he's from New York.
L31534	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
L31533	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
L31532	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	He all right?
L31649	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
L31648	u279	m17	MRS. HOBBS	Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
L31647	u269	m17	ALEX	Has he been refusing food?
L31646	u279	m17	MRS. HOBBS	Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
L31645	u269	m17	ALEX	Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
L31644	u279	m17	MRS. HOBBS	Miss Price.
L32104	u274	m17	DAVID	That's what I want you to do, you moron!
L32103	u271	m17	BOBBIE	You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
L32102	u274	m17	DAVID	Who is this girl?
L32099	u274	m17	DAVID	Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
L32098	u271	m17	BOBBIE	Now see here young man.
L32097	u274	m17	DAVID	Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
L32096	u271	m17	BOBBIE	There's no call for that kind of language.
L32095	u274	m17	DAVID	Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
L32094	u271	m17	BOBBIE	All right, you two, move along.
L32089	u271	m17	BOBBIE	You did, did you?
L32088	u274	m17	DAVID	Officer, I killed those people last night.
L32171	u274	m17	DAVID	Why are you doing this to me?
L32170	u272	m17	BRINGSLY	No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
L32169	u274	m17	DAVID	That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
L32161	u272	m17	BRINGSLY	You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
L32160	u274	m17	DAVID	Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
L32159	u272	m17	BRINGSLY	This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
L32158	u274	m17	DAVID	Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
L31475	u283	m17	WOMAN	You could have told them!
L31474	u273	m17	CHESS PLAYER	No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
L31429	u283	m17	WOMAN	That's very funny, that is.
L31428	u273	m17	CHESS PLAYER	Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
L31421	u273	m17	CHESS PLAYER	No. You've had your chance.
L31420	u283	m17	WOMAN	Oh, come on, tell us.
L31419	u273	m17	CHESS PLAYER	All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
L31418	u283	m17	WOMAN	Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
L31417	u273	m17	CHESS PLAYER	You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
L31416	u283	m17	WOMAN	No, but we're about to.
L31415	u273	m17	CHESS PLAYER	Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
L31642	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	Bambi?
L31641	u274	m17	DAVID	Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
L31640	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	Some, everyone does.
L31639	u274	m17	DAVID	Do you have bad dreams, too?
L31638	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
L31637	u274	m17	DAVID	What are you going to see?
L31636	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
L31635	u274	m17	DAVID	Alex?
L31634	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
L31633	u274	m17	DAVID	What time is it?
L31632	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
L31630	u274	m17	DAVID	I was having a nightmare.
L31629	u278	m17	MISS GALLAGHER	Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
L31712	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
L31711	u274	m17	DAVID	Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
L31709	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
L31708	u274	m17	DAVID	You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
L31707	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
L31706	u274	m17	DAVID	Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
L31705	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I really don't know.
L31704	u274	m17	DAVID	Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
L31703	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
L31702	u274	m17	DAVID	Did you see Jack?
L31701	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
L31700	u274	m17	DAVID	Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
L31699	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Yes.
L31698	u274	m17	DAVID	I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
L31697	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
L31696	u274	m17	DAVID	Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
L31695	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You've never had bad dreams before?
L31628	u274	m17	DAVID	Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
L31627	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
L31626	u274	m17	DAVID	How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
L31625	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	So they said.
L31624	u274	m17	DAVID	There were witnesses?
L31584	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
L31583	u274	m17	DAVID	Lunatic?
L31582	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
L31581	u274	m17	DAVID	Two weeks?
L31580	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
L31579	u274	m17	DAVID	How long have I been here?
L31573	u274	m17	DAVID	Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
L31572	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
L31564	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
L31563	u274	m17	DAVID	The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
L31562	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
L31561	u274	m17	DAVID	London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
L31560	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You're in a hospital in London.
L31559	u274	m17	DAVID	Where am I?
L31558	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
L32177	u276	m17	JACK	If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
L32176	u274	m17	DAVID	I could hang myself.
L32173	u274	m17	DAVID	How shall I do it?
L32172	u276	m17	JACK	Because this must be stopped.
L32156	u276	m17	JACK	Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
L32155	u274	m17	DAVID	Hello.
L32154	u276	m17	JACK	David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
L32153	u276	m17	JACK	I want you to meet some people.
L32152	u274	m17	DAVID	Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
L32151	u276	m17	JACK	What about the zoo?
L32150	u274	m17	DAVID	I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
L32149	u276	m17	JACK	Thank you.
L32148	u274	m17	DAVID	You look awful.
L32147	u276	m17	JACK	If I was still alive, I probably would.
L32146	u274	m17	DAVID	Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
L32145	u276	m17	JACK	You don't have to say anything.
L32144	u274	m17	DAVID	What can I say, Jack?
L32143	u276	m17	JACK	Hi, David.
L32142	u274	m17	DAVID	Hi, Jack.
L31874	u274	m17	DAVID	I will not accept this! Now go away!
L31873	u276	m17	JACK	The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
L31872	u274	m17	DAVID	What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
L31871	u276	m17	JACK	You must believe me.
L31870	u274	m17	DAVID	I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
L31869	u276	m17	JACK	What do you think?
L31868	u274	m17	DAVID	Jack, are you really dead?
L31867	u276	m17	JACK	You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
L31866	u274	m17	DAVID	A monster. I know, I know.
L31865	u276	m17	JACK	David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
L31864	u274	m17	DAVID	Get out of here, Jack!
L31863	u276	m17	JACK	Yes.
L31862	u274	m17	DAVID	I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
L31861	u276	m17	JACK	David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
L31860	u274	m17	DAVID	Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
L31859	u276	m17	JACK	I wanted to see you.
L31858	u274	m17	DAVID	What are you doing here?
L31857	u276	m17	JACK	Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
L31856	u274	m17	DAVID	You're not real.
L31812	u276	m17	JACK	It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
L31811	u274	m17	DAVID	Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
L31810	u276	m17	JACK	The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
L31809	u274	m17	DAVID	Nurse!
L31808	u276	m17	JACK	Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
L31807	u274	m17	DAVID	Nurse!
L31806	u276	m17	JACK	David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
L31805	u274	m17	DAVID	You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
L31804	u276	m17	JACK	You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
L31803	u274	m17	DAVID	Jack, please go away. Please go away.
L31802	u276	m17	JACK	Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
L31801	u274	m17	DAVID	Stop it, Jack.
L31800	u276	m17	JACK	Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
L31799	u274	m17	DAVID	What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
L31798	u276	m17	JACK	You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
L31797	u274	m17	DAVID	What?!
L31796	u276	m17	JACK	It's you, David.
L31795	u274	m17	DAVID	Will you be quiet?!
L31794	u276	m17	JACK	The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
L31793	u274	m17	DAVID	What's wrong with you? Shut up!
L31792	u276	m17	JACK	I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
L31791	u274	m17	DAVID	Shut up, you zombie!
L31790	u276	m17	JACK	On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
L31789	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm not listening!
L31788	u276	m17	JACK	We were attacked by a werewolf.
L31787	u274	m17	DAVID	If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
L31786	u276	m17	JACK	I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
L31785	u274	m17	DAVID	Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
L31784	u276	m17	JACK	David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
L31783	u274	m17	DAVID	What?!
L31782	u276	m17	JACK	David!
L31781	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm going completely crazy.
L31780	u276	m17	JACK	Life mocks me even in death.
L31779	u274	m17	DAVID	Rudy Levine the shmuck?
L31778	u276	m17	JACK	So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
L31777	u274	m17	DAVID	I can't stand it.
L31776	u276	m17	JACK	Debbie Klein cried a lot.
L31775	u274	m17	DAVID	Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
L31774	u276	m17	JACK	Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
L31773	u274	m17	DAVID	Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
L31772	u276	m17	JACK	I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
L31771	u274	m17	DAVID	Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
L31770	u276	m17	JACK	David! You're hurting my feelings.
L31769	u276	m17	JACK	I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
L31768	u274	m17	DAVID	This is too much. I can't handle this.
L31767	u276	m17	JACK	Thanks a lot.
L31766	u274	m17	DAVID	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
L31765	u276	m17	JACK	Nice to see you.
L31525	u274	m17	DAVID	Are you going to help me up?
L31524	u276	m17	JACK	You really scared me, you shithead.
L31523	u274	m17	DAVID	Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
L31522	u276	m17	JACK	I'll tell you when we get there.
L31521	u274	m17	DAVID	Where are we going?
L31520	u276	m17	JACK	Yeah.
L31519	u274	m17	DAVID	Jack?
L31518	u276	m17	JACK	Not far enough. Come on.
L31517	u274	m17	DAVID	It sounds far away.
L31516	u276	m17	JACK	No.
L31515	u274	m17	DAVID	See anything?
L31514	u276	m17	JACK	Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
L31513	u274	m17	DAVID	Walk away, Jack.
L31512	u276	m17	JACK	Nice doggie. Good boy.
L31511	u274	m17	DAVID	A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
L31510	u276	m17	JACK	Oh shit. What is that?
L31509	u276	m17	JACK	Do you think it's a dog?
L31508	u274	m17	DAVID	It's in front of us.
L31506	u274	m17	DAVID	Let's just keep walking.
L31505	u276	m17	JACK	Plan?
L31504	u274	m17	DAVID	What's the plan?
L31502	u276	m17	JACK	It's circling us.
L31501	u274	m17	DAVID	It's moving.
L31500	u274	m17	DAVID	Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
L31499	u276	m17	JACK	Come on, where?
L31498	u274	m17	DAVID	I don't know. Come on.
L31497	u276	m17	JACK	Shit! David, what is that?
L31495	u274	m17	DAVID	Yeah.
L31494	u276	m17	JACK	I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
L31493	u276	m17	JACK	It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
L31492	u274	m17	DAVID	No, but he was on the moors.
L31491	u276	m17	JACK	Heathcliffe didn't howl.
L31490	u274	m17	DAVID	Heathcliffe.
L31489	u276	m17	JACK	Pecos Bill.
L31488	u274	m17	DAVID	The Hound of the Baskervilles.
L31487	u276	m17	JACK	There aren't any coyotes in England.
L31486	u274	m17	DAVID	A coyote.
L31485	u276	m17	JACK	Yeah?
L31484	u274	m17	DAVID	Could be a lot of things.
L31483	u276	m17	JACK	What was it?
L31482	u274	m17	DAVID	I heard that.
L31481	u276	m17	JACK	Did you hear that?
L31471	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
L31470	u276	m17	JACK	Say, David...
L31467	u274	m17	DAVID	I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
L31466	u276	m17	JACK	Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
L31465	u274	m17	DAVID	I have no idea.
L31464	u276	m17	JACK	What do you think was wrong?
L31463	u274	m17	DAVID	Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
L31462	u276	m17	JACK	I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
L31461	u274	m17	DAVID	That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
L31456	u274	m17	DAVID	Come on, I'm freezing.
L31455	u276	m17	JACK	Beware the moon?
L31454	u274	m17	DAVID	I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
L31453	u276	m17	JACK	What the hell was that all about?
L31444	u276	m17	JACK	Apparently so.
L31443	u274	m17	DAVID	Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
L31441	u276	m17	JACK	What do you mean? I'm starving.
L31440	u274	m17	DAVID	Jack, we'd better go.
L31431	u274	m17	DAVID	You ask them.
L31430	u276	m17	JACK	Go on, ask them.
L31427	u274	m17	DAVID	Wrong.
L31426	u276	m17	JACK	Right.
L31425	u274	m17	DAVID	I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
L31424	u276	m17	JACK	Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
L31423	u274	m17	DAVID	You ask them.
L31422	u276	m17	JACK	Ask them what the candles are for.
L31406	u274	m17	DAVID	Maybe the owners are from Texas.
L31405	u276	m17	JACK	It's a five-pointed star.
L31404	u274	m17	DAVID	What about it?
L31403	u276	m17	JACK	Look at that.
L31402	u274	m17	DAVID	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
L31401	u276	m17	JACK	Nice looking group.
L31388	u276	m17	JACK	Nice to see you.
L31387	u274	m17	DAVID	Hello.
L31386	u274	m17	DAVID	Shall we?
L31385	u276	m17	JACK	Okay.
L31384	u274	m17	DAVID	I assume full responsibility.
L31383	u276	m17	JACK	David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
L31382	u274	m17	DAVID	A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
L31381	u276	m17	JACK	That's not a spear. It's a pike.
L31380	u274	m17	DAVID	Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
L31379	u276	m17	JACK	That's a wolf's head.
L31378	u274	m17	DAVID	Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
L31377	u276	m17	JACK	The Slaughtered Lamb?
L31376	u276	m17	JACK	She says she 'likes me too much'.
L31375	u274	m17	DAVID	We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
L31374	u276	m17	JACK	It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
L31373	u274	m17	DAVID	It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
L31372	u276	m17	JACK	I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
L31371	u274	m17	DAVID	If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
L31370	u276	m17	JACK	Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
L31369	u274	m17	DAVID	I don't know.
L31368	u276	m17	JACK	Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
L31367	u274	m17	DAVID	I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
L31366	u276	m17	JACK	You're talking about the woman I love.
L31365	u274	m17	DAVID	She's a jerk.
L31364	u276	m17	JACK	Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
L31363	u274	m17	DAVID	I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
L31362	u276	m17	JACK	Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
L31361	u274	m17	DAVID	Right.
L31360	u276	m17	JACK	I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
L31359	u274	m17	DAVID	Well, I like it here.
L31358	u276	m17	JACK	Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
L31357	u274	m17	DAVID	You're not having a good time are you?
L31356	u276	m17	JACK	David.
L31355	u274	m17	DAVID	Jack.
L31354	u276	m17	JACK	Good.
L31353	u274	m17	DAVID	Yes.
L31352	u276	m17	JACK	Are you cold?
L32131	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
L32130	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	What can we do to assist you?
L32123	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
L32122	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
L31614	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Why don't we ask him?
L31613	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
L31612	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	You were saying?
L31603	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
L31602	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	No, thank you, Doctor.
L31597	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
L31596	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	Dr. Hirsch?
L31611	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
L31610	u281	m17	SECRETARY	He's on the telephone.
L31609	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	What here?
L31608	u281	m17	SECRETARY	Roger Mathison, Doctor.
L31607	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Excuse me.  Yes?
L31595	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Send them in.
L31594	u281	m17	SECRETARY	Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
L31593	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Yes?
L31896	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
L31895	u283	m17	WOMAN	Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
L31894	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	What's that?
L31884	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	I suppose Guinness will suffice.
L31883	u283	m17	WOMAN	Sorry, love.
L31882	u275	m17	DR. HIRSCH	Campari and soda would do nicely.
L31881	u283	m17	WOMAN	Hello, there. What can I get you?
L31408	u283	m17	WOMAN	I beg your pardon?
L31407	u276	m17	JACK	Remember the Alamo?
L31399	u283	m17	WOMAN	But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
L31398	u276	m17	JACK	Oh.
L31397	u283	m17	WOMAN	No.
L31396	u276	m17	JACK	Then you have some hot tea?
L31395	u283	m17	WOMAN	We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
L31394	u276	m17	JACK	Hot chocolate?
L31391	u283	m17	WOMAN	No.
L31390	u276	m17	JACK	Do you have any hot soup?
L32133	u282	m17	SGT. MCMANUS	We'll find him, not to worry.
L32132	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
L31622	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
L31621	u282	m17	SGT. MCMANUS	I don't rightly know, sir.
L31620	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	And what, Sergeant?
L31619	u282	m17	SGT. MCMANUS	Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
L31618	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
L31617	u282	m17	SGT. MCMANUS	He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
L31606	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
L31605	u282	m17	SGT. MCMANUS	Sorry.
L31599	u282	m17	SGT. MCMANUS	I'd like some tea, please.
L31598	u277	m17	LT. VILLIERS	No, thank you.
L154570	u753	m48	MAX	This.
L154569	u744	m48	BLONDE	How I make my living, what's your point?
L154568	u753	m48	MAX	Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
L154567	u744	m48	BLONDE	No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
L154566	u753	m48	MAX	No?
L154565	u744	m48	BLONDE	But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
L154564	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah.
L154563	u744	m48	BLONDE	Oh, yeah?
L154562	u753	m48	MAX	Bruno's girlfriend.
L154561	u744	m48	BLONDE	Who are you?
L154664	u753	m48	MAX	This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
L154663	u745	m48	BRUNO	None of your business.
L154662	u753	m48	MAX	Who's Camille?
L154661	u745	m48	BRUNO	What the hell are you doing?
L154660	u753	m48	MAX	Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
L154659	u753	m48	MAX	He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
L154658	u745	m48	BRUNO	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
L154657	u753	m48	MAX	This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
L154656	u753	m48	MAX	I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
L154655	u745	m48	BRUNO	How come I never hearda you before?
L154654	u753	m48	MAX	Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
L154653	u745	m48	BRUNO	That's a lotta crap.
L154652	u753	m48	MAX	I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
L154651	u745	m48	BRUNO	What're you talkin' about?
L154650	u753	m48	MAX	You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
L154644	u745	m48	BRUNO	You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
L154643	u753	m48	MAX	See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
L154642	u753	m48	MAX	You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
L154641	u745	m48	BRUNO	Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
L154639	u745	m48	BRUNO	What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
L154638	u753	m48	MAX	That's not why we're here.
L154637	u745	m48	BRUNO	What?
L154636	u753	m48	MAX	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
L154635	u745	m48	BRUNO	Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
L154634	u753	m48	MAX	I like to keep it professional, that's all.
L154633	u745	m48	BRUNO	Man, you got a bad attitude.
L154632	u753	m48	MAX	Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
L154631	u745	m48	BRUNO	You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
L154630	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah?
L154629	u745	m48	BRUNO	I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
L154628	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, sure, I understand.
L154627	u745	m48	BRUNO	Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
L154595	u753	m48	MAX	Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
L154594	u745	m48	BRUNO	Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
L154593	u753	m48	MAX	Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
L154592	u745	m48	BRUNO	No wire.
L154575	u745	m48	BRUNO	Guess again.
L154574	u753	m48	MAX	I'm on a break.
L154573	u745	m48	BRUNO	Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
L154172	u746	m48	DARREN	Where?
L154171	u749	m48	KENDRA	Move it.
L154163	u749	m48	KENDRA	No.
L154162	u746	m48	DARREN	Can I say something in my defense?
L154161	u749	m48	KENDRA	Leave.  Now.
L154160	u746	m48	DARREN	Nothing happened between me and Tia.
L154157	u749	m48	KENDRA	You know each other?
L154156	u746	m48	DARREN	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
L154155	u749	m48	KENDRA	Some of us are trying to sleep.
L154055	u746	m48	DARREN	Could you give us a moment.
L154054	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
L154053	u746	m48	DARREN	Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
L154052	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	She was there...
L154051	u746	m48	DARREN	Do you know why I went after Justine?
L154050	u746	m48	DARREN	Justine was not an unwilling participant.
L154049	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
L154046	u746	m48	DARREN	You're not still pissed?
L154045	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You mean until you showed up?
L154044	u746	m48	DARREN	How're ya doin', Max.
L154177	u753	m48	MAX	Don't look down.
L154176	u746	m48	DARREN	But I'm afraid of--
L154175	u753	m48	MAX	Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
L154174	u746	m48	DARREN	No way.
L154173	u753	m48	MAX	Out there.
L154170	u753	m48	MAX	No time.
L154169	u746	m48	DARREN	Lemme put some clothes on.
L154168	u746	m48	DARREN	What?  Where're we going?
L154167	u753	m48	MAX	It's a sweep.  C'mon.
L154166	u753	m48	MAX	Police drone.
L154165	u746	m48	DARREN	What is it?
L154154	u746	m48	DARREN	You're roommates?
L154153	u753	m48	MAX	I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
L154152	u746	m48	DARREN	What are you doing here?
L154058	u746	m48	DARREN	I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
L154057	u753	m48	MAX	I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
L154056	u746	m48	DARREN	I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
L154048	u746	m48	DARREN	It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
L154047	u753	m48	MAX	Why would I be pissed?
L154713	u747	m48	HERBAL	Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
L154712	u754	m48	NORMAL	What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
L153986	u754	m48	NORMAL	Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
L153985	u747	m48	HERBAL	It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
L153984	u754	m48	NORMAL	Which is none of your business...or mine.
L153983	u747	m48	HERBAL	"Like de prophets say, ""Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."""
L153982	u754	m48	NORMAL	So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
L153981	u747	m48	HERBAL	Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
L154491	u753	m48	MAX	I got overhead...
L154490	u748	m48	INGA	So Max, what do you do with all your money?
L154489	u748	m48	INGA	Am I?
L154488	u753	m48	MAX	You're light a deuce.
L154487	u753	m48	MAX	It's a rule.
L154486	u748	m48	INGA	I'll make it worth your while.
L154485	u753	m48	MAX	I don't get involved with guns.
L154484	u748	m48	INGA	I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
L154483	u753	m48	MAX	Later.
L154482	u748	m48	INGA	I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
L154481	u753	m48	MAX	I ain't mad at you...
L154480	u748	m48	INGA	Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
L154479	u753	m48	MAX	A grand.
L154478	u748	m48	INGA	What're you looking for?
L154477	u753	m48	MAX	Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
L154476	u748	m48	INGA	Same old story.  Not interested.
L154475	u753	m48	MAX	Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
L154474	u748	m48	INGA	Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
L154473	u753	m48	MAX	I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
L154472	u748	m48	INGA	Where'd you clip this?
L154191	u753	m48	MAX	Every week.
L154190	u749	m48	KENDRA	You didn't...
L154189	u753	m48	MAX	Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
L154188	u749	m48	KENDRA	What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
L154179	u753	m48	MAX	And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
L154178	u749	m48	KENDRA	What a creep.
L154159	u749	m48	KENDRA	Yech...
L154158	u753	m48	MAX	He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
L153967	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, me too.
L153966	u749	m48	KENDRA	Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
L153965	u753	m48	MAX	I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
L154611	u753	m48	MAX	Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
L154610	u750	m48	LAUREN	Hello...
L154609	u753	m48	MAX	Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
L154557	u753	m48	MAX	Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
L154556	u750	m48	LAUREN	What else can we do?
L154555	u753	m48	MAX	We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
L154554	u750	m48	LAUREN	If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
L154551	u753	m48	MAX	Look, I'd really like to...
L154550	u750	m48	LAUREN	Can you help me get her back?
L154549	u753	m48	MAX	Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
L154547	u750	m48	LAUREN	I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
L154546	u753	m48	MAX	I know.
L154545	u750	m48	LAUREN	They took my daughter.
L154544	u753	m48	MAX	Damn... Are you alright?
L154123	u753	m48	MAX	SHHH!  Don't do that!
L154122	u750	m48	LAUREN	Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
L154621	u750	m48	LAUREN	There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
L154620	u758	m48	SOPHY	Mommy, I'm scared.
L154619	u750	m48	LAUREN	Soon, baby.
L154618	u758	m48	SOPHY	When?
L154617	u750	m48	LAUREN	Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
L154616	u758	m48	SOPHY	Mommy, where are you?
L154615	u750	m48	LAUREN	Sophy?  Are you okay?
L154442	u758	m48	SOPHY	Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
L154441	u750	m48	LAUREN	Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
L154440	u758	m48	SOPHY	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
L154439	u750	m48	LAUREN	What makes you cry?
L154438	u758	m48	SOPHY	Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
L154437	u750	m48	LAUREN	No...
L154436	u758	m48	SOPHY	Are we in some kind of trouble?
L154435	u750	m48	LAUREN	Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
L154434	u758	m48	SOPHY	But why can't we stay here?
L154433	u750	m48	LAUREN	I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
L154432	u758	m48	SOPHY	I don't want to move away.
L154431	u750	m48	LAUREN	Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
L154748	u753	m48	MAX	Zack... He made it... He's alive...
L154747	u751	m48	LOGAN	That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
L154746	u751	m48	LOGAN	And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
L154745	u753	m48	MAX	Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
L154744	u751	m48	LOGAN	With your help.
L154743	u753	m48	MAX	And you still think you can do something to change that.
L154742	u751	m48	LOGAN	Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
L154741	u753	m48	MAX	We're quoting Mom again.
L154740	u751	m48	LOGAN	You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
L154739	u753	m48	MAX	And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
L154738	u751	m48	LOGAN	These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
L154737	u753	m48	MAX	Look, thank you for this but--
L154736	u751	m48	LOGAN	Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
L154735	u751	m48	LOGAN	Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
L154734	u753	m48	MAX	I don't know what to say.
L154733	u751	m48	LOGAN	It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
L154732	u751	m48	LOGAN	Open it.
L154731	u753	m48	MAX	What's this?
L154730	u753	m48	MAX	That's what soldiers do, right?
L154729	u751	m48	LOGAN	On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
L154728	u753	m48	MAX	Well, not me personally.
L154727	u751	m48	LOGAN	I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
L154726	u753	m48	MAX	You believe that?
L154725	u751	m48	LOGAN	My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
L154724	u753	m48	MAX	I'm sorry.
L154723	u751	m48	LOGAN	Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
L154722	u753	m48	MAX	I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
L154721	u751	m48	LOGAN	Somebody's got to.
L154720	u753	m48	MAX	See you're back and still rocking the boat.
L154471	u753	m48	MAX	That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
L154470	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
L154469	u753	m48	MAX	They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
L154468	u753	m48	MAX	They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
L154467	u751	m48	LOGAN	She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
L154466	u753	m48	MAX	I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
L154465	u751	m48	LOGAN	So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
L154464	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
L154463	u751	m48	LOGAN	She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
L154462	u753	m48	MAX	That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
L154461	u751	m48	LOGAN	The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
L154460	u753	m48	MAX	I already don't like the sound of this.
L154459	u751	m48	LOGAN	Your help.
L154458	u753	m48	MAX	What's in it for you?
L154457	u751	m48	LOGAN	I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
L154456	u753	m48	MAX	You said you could help.
L154455	u751	m48	LOGAN	Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
L154454	u753	m48	MAX	Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
L154453	u751	m48	LOGAN	Hardly...
L154452	u753	m48	MAX	Your basic hodge-podge.
L154451	u751	m48	LOGAN	A girl.
L154450	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
L154449	u751	m48	LOGAN	"The technical term for you is ""chimera""..."
L154448	u753	m48	MAX	I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
L154447	u751	m48	LOGAN	How much do you know?
L154446	u753	m48	MAX	I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
L154445	u751	m48	LOGAN	How well do you remember the lab?
L154444	u753	m48	MAX	We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
L154427	u751	m48	LOGAN	The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
L154426	u753	m48	MAX	Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
L154425	u751	m48	LOGAN	He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
L154424	u753	m48	MAX	I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
L154422	u753	m48	MAX	You did go through my stuff.
L154421	u751	m48	LOGAN	L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
L154420	u751	m48	LOGAN	C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
L154419	u753	m48	MAX	You lost me.
L154418	u751	m48	LOGAN	The other one like you...
L154417	u753	m48	MAX	The other ones?
L154416	u751	m48	LOGAN	Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
L154413	u751	m48	LOGAN	Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
L154412	u753	m48	MAX	Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
L154410	u751	m48	LOGAN	No, I meant this.
L154409	u753	m48	MAX	Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
L154408	u751	m48	LOGAN	C'mere, I want to show you something.
L154407	u753	m48	MAX	You need to get out more.
L154406	u751	m48	LOGAN	I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
L154405	u753	m48	MAX	You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
L154404	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
L154403	u753	m48	MAX	Yes on all counts.
L154402	u751	m48	LOGAN	Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
L154399	u753	m48	MAX	We are not fine.
L154398	u751	m48	LOGAN	It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
L154397	u753	m48	MAX	Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
L154396	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
L154395	u753	m48	MAX	How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
L154394	u751	m48	LOGAN	That would be appropriate, yes.
L154393	u753	m48	MAX	Am I s'posed to be grateful?
L154392	u751	m48	LOGAN	So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
L154391	u753	m48	MAX	How do I know you didn't?
L154390	u751	m48	LOGAN	You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
L154389	u753	m48	MAX	Bent.
L154388	u751	m48	LOGAN	Bent?
L154387	u753	m48	MAX	Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
L154386	u751	m48	LOGAN	Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
L154385	u753	m48	MAX	You got a lotta nerve.
L154384	u751	m48	LOGAN	It was open.
L154383	u753	m48	MAX	Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
L154382	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'm not a half bad cook.
L154381	u753	m48	MAX	I won't be staying.
L154380	u751	m48	LOGAN	Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
L154313	u751	m48	LOGAN	Yeah...
L154312	u753	m48	MAX	Is the social studies class over for today?
L154311	u751	m48	LOGAN	You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
L154310	u753	m48	MAX	Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
L154309	u751	m48	LOGAN	Something.
L154308	u753	m48	MAX	So what are you gonna do about it?
L154307	u751	m48	LOGAN	People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
L154306	u753	m48	MAX	You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
L154305	u751	m48	LOGAN	Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
L154304	u753	m48	MAX	So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
L154303	u751	m48	LOGAN	Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
L154302	u753	m48	MAX	What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
L154301	u751	m48	LOGAN	One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
L154300	u753	m48	MAX	Girlfriend?
L154299	u751	m48	LOGAN	Lauren's not my wife.
L154298	u753	m48	MAX	How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
L154297	u751	m48	LOGAN	Too early to tell.
L154296	u753	m48	MAX	So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
L154295	u751	m48	LOGAN	Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
L154294	u753	m48	MAX	Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
L154293	u751	m48	LOGAN	Wasn't that hard.
L154292	u753	m48	MAX	How'd you find me?
L154290	u751	m48	LOGAN	The one you're wearing?
L154289	u753	m48	MAX	Lemme get my coat.
L154287	u751	m48	LOGAN	Can we go somewhere and talk?
L154286	u753	m48	MAX	Sorry about your window.
L154284	u751	m48	LOGAN	Logan Cale.
L154283	u753	m48	MAX	Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
L154282	u751	m48	LOGAN	We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
L154281	u753	m48	MAX	So this guy walks into a bar and says...
L154144	u753	m48	MAX	The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
L154143	u751	m48	LOGAN	Who is...
L154142	u753	m48	MAX	No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
L154141	u751	m48	LOGAN	So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
L154140	u753	m48	MAX	Whoever that is.
L154139	u751	m48	LOGAN	You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
L154138	u751	m48	LOGAN	We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
L154137	u753	m48	MAX	I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
L154136	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
L154135	u753	m48	MAX	Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
L154134	u751	m48	LOGAN	I was expecting someone else.
L154133	u753	m48	MAX	First time I ever heard that.
L154132	u751	m48	LOGAN	Thank God.
L154131	u753	m48	MAX	Girl's gotta make a living.
L154130	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're a thief?
L154265	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'll wait.
L154264	u754	m48	NORMAL	None.
L154263	u751	m48	LOGAN	Any idea when she'll be back?
L154262	u754	m48	NORMAL	Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
L154260	u754	m48	NORMAL	Can't help you.
L154259	u751	m48	LOGAN	I need to talk to her.
L154258	u754	m48	NORMAL	She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
L154257	u751	m48	LOGAN	But she does work here?
L154256	u754	m48	NORMAL	You don't want to.
L154255	u751	m48	LOGAN	Know where I can find her?
L154254	u754	m48	NORMAL	Ladies would be elsewhere.
L154253	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'm looking for a lady who works here.
L154361	u753	m48	MAX	And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
L154360	u752	m48	LYDIA	I understand.
L154359	u753	m48	MAX	"Say the words, ""I understand."""
L154358	u752	m48	LYDIA	Okay, okay.
L154357	u753	m48	MAX	Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
L154356	u752	m48	LYDIA	Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
L154354	u752	m48	LYDIA	Let go of my hand.
L154353	u753	m48	MAX	This is not a place you wanna go.
L154352	u752	m48	LYDIA	Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
L154351	u753	m48	MAX	I think you should go now.
L154350	u752	m48	LYDIA	You're also a fool.
L154349	u753	m48	MAX	Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
L154348	u752	m48	LYDIA	How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
L154347	u753	m48	MAX	Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
L154346	u752	m48	LYDIA	Oh?
L154345	u753	m48	MAX	And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
L154344	u752	m48	LYDIA	I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
L154343	u753	m48	MAX	Look, I don't know what you want--
L154342	u752	m48	LYDIA	He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
L154341	u753	m48	MAX	How do I know you're telling the truth?
L154340	u752	m48	LYDIA	With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
L154339	u753	m48	MAX	You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
L154338	u752	m48	LYDIA	My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
L154337	u753	m48	MAX	Who are you?
L154336	u752	m48	LYDIA	To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
L154335	u753	m48	MAX	What do you want?
L154334	u752	m48	LYDIA	A friend of your fiance's.
L154333	u753	m48	MAX	Who is it?
L154676	u753	m48	MAX	I'm on my way.
L154675	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
L154674	u753	m48	MAX	Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
L154673	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Got a pencil?
L154672	u753	m48	MAX	Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
L154669	u753	m48	MAX	Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
L154668	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
L154667	u753	m48	MAX	I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
L154510	u753	m48	MAX	You and me both.
L154509	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
L154508	u753	m48	MAX	Bastard...
L154507	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
L154506	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
L154505	u753	m48	MAX	You're crazy.
L154504	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
L154503	u753	m48	MAX	Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
L154502	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
L154501	u753	m48	MAX	How's this about me?
L154500	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
L154499	u753	m48	MAX	Here's your money.
L154498	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
L154495	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
L154494	u753	m48	MAX	As long as you're okay.
L154115	u753	m48	MAX	More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
L154114	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
L154113	u753	m48	MAX	You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
L154112	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
L154111	u753	m48	MAX	What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
L154110	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
L154109	u753	m48	MAX	She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
L154108	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
L154107	u753	m48	MAX	Nothing on Hannah?
L154106	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
L154105	u753	m48	MAX	Then what?
L154104	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
L154102	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
L154101	u753	m48	MAX	Thank you.
L154100	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
L154099	u753	m48	MAX	Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
L154098	u753	m48	MAX	Sorry, I was seven at the time.
L154097	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
L154096	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Right here someplace.
L154095	u753	m48	MAX	My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
L154094	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
L154093	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
L154092	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	You drive away business roarin' in like that.
L154091	u753	m48	MAX	You did.
L154090	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I asked you to keep that thing outside.
L154280	u753	m48	MAX	But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
L154279	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
L154278	u753	m48	MAX	Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
L154277	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Only one I can think of.
L154276	u753	m48	MAX	They don't have a lot of moving parts.
L154275	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	So are dogs.
L154274	u753	m48	MAX	They're prisoners to their genes.
L154273	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Please...
L154272	u753	m48	MAX	And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
L154271	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Friends don't help other friends cheat.
L154270	u753	m48	MAX	And because he's my friend.
L154269	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Unlikely.
L154268	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
L154267	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
L154089	u753	m48	MAX	It's a secret.
L154088	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Where?
L154087	u753	m48	MAX	Gotta go.
L154086	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
L154085	u753	m48	MAX	A fog bank.
L154084	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
L154083	u753	m48	MAX	Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
L154082	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
L154081	u753	m48	MAX	A long time.
L154080	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	How long you and me known each other?
L154079	u753	m48	MAX	If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
L154078	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You know what I'm saying.
L154077	u753	m48	MAX	A little what?
L154076	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
L154075	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah.
L154074	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
L154073	u753	m48	MAX	No.
L154072	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
L154071	u753	m48	MAX	Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
L154070	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	What?
L154069	u753	m48	MAX	That's odd...
L154062	u753	m48	MAX	I just don't go in with any expectations.
L154061	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
L154060	u753	m48	MAX	What guys do.  'Nother order.
L154059	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
L154005	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
L154004	u753	m48	MAX	Straight.
L154003	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
L154002	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
L154001	u753	m48	MAX	At least he didn't swing with your ride.
L154000	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
L153999	u753	m48	MAX	Morning, Sunshine...
L154625	u753	m48	MAX	Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
L154624	u757	m48	SONRISA	You get it when I get her.
L154623	u753	m48	MAX	Can you put that in a bag or something?
L154608	u753	m48	MAX	She's gonna want to hear for herself.
L154607	u757	m48	SONRISA	She's got my word.
L154606	u753	m48	MAX	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
L154605	u757	m48	SONRISA	Make the call.
L154604	u753	m48	MAX	I have sincere eyes.
L154603	u757	m48	SONRISA	And she bought that?
L154602	u753	m48	MAX	I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
L154601	u757	m48	SONRISA	So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
L154598	u757	m48	SONRISA	Pull the cash.
L154597	u753	m48	MAX	Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
L154590	u753	m48	MAX	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
L154589	u757	m48	SONRISA	Who are you?
L154585	u753	m48	MAX	You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
L154584	u757	m48	SONRISA	I actually know how this works.
L154583	u753	m48	MAX	Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
L154582	u757	m48	SONRISA	Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
L154581	u753	m48	MAX	Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
L154580	u757	m48	SONRISA	Not right now?  Okay, when?
L154579	u753	m48	MAX	Not right now.
L154578	u757	m48	SONRISA	I'll bet you can.  Sit.
L154577	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
L154209	u753	m48	MAX	You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
L154208	u759	m48	THEO	Tell everybody hey.
L154207	u753	m48	MAX	Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
L154206	u759	m48	THEO	What if he's on the level?
L154205	u753	m48	MAX	Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
L154204	u759	m48	THEO	I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
L154203	u753	m48	MAX	Probably a touch of what's going around.
L154202	u759	m48	THEO	Feel like the dog's dinner.
L154201	u753	m48	MAX	Playing hooky again?
L153973	u759	m48	THEO	You're the best, Maxie.
L153972	u753	m48	MAX	It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
L154524	u753	m48	MAX	Shut-up...
L154523	u756	m48	SKETCHY	That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
L154373	u753	m48	MAX	"Say the words, ""I understand."""
L154372	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Okay, okay, okay--
L154371	u753	m48	MAX	You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
L154370	u756	m48	SKETCHY	True, but--
L154369	u753	m48	MAX	None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
L154368	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She was the one--
L154367	u753	m48	MAX	You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
L154366	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
L154365	u753	m48	MAX	Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
L154364	u756	m48	SKETCHY	No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
L154363	u753	m48	MAX	Easy Sketchy.
L154362	u756	m48	SKETCHY	You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
L154328	u753	m48	MAX	You don't.
L154327	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
L154326	u753	m48	MAX	I'll give it my best shot.
L154325	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
L154324	u753	m48	MAX	And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
L154323	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
L154322	u753	m48	MAX	How'd you get her out of town?
L154321	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
L154320	u753	m48	MAX	Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
L154319	u756	m48	SKETCHY	But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
L154318	u753	m48	MAX	--a philandering pig.
L154317	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She tells you how I've been--
L154316	u753	m48	MAX	You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
L154315	u756	m48	SKETCHY	So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
L154250	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
L154249	u753	m48	MAX	And why should she?
L154248	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
L154247	u753	m48	MAX	What happens if you level with her?
L154246	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
L154245	u753	m48	MAX	Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
L154244	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
L154243	u753	m48	MAX	A toy?
L154242	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I'm a toy to her.
L154241	u753	m48	MAX	And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
L154240	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Lydia.
L154239	u753	m48	MAX	Does this person have a name?
L154238	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
L154237	u753	m48	MAX	Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
L154236	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Exactly.
L154235	u753	m48	MAX	And you were a sympathetic ear.
L154234	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
L154233	u753	m48	MAX	Really?
L154232	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I'm the victim here.
L154231	u753	m48	MAX	Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
L154230	u756	m48	SKETCHY	But there's another side--
L154229	u753	m48	MAX	You left out condescending.
L154228	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
L154227	u753	m48	MAX	Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
L154226	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Max--
L154225	u753	m48	MAX	Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
L154224	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
L154223	u753	m48	MAX	I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
L154221	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
L154220	u753	m48	MAX	You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
L154218	u753	m48	MAX	What's up?
L154217	u756	m48	SKETCHY	We gotta talk.
L154216	u753	m48	MAX	Hey, Sketchy--
L154030	u756	m48	SKETCHY	But I'll take a rain check...
L154029	u753	m48	MAX	Right, the big one-oh.
L154028	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
L154027	u753	m48	MAX	Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
L154018	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Later.
L154017	u753	m48	MAX	Catch you back at the wall.
L154521	u753	m48	MAX	Theo's dead.
L154520	u754	m48	NORMAL	Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
L154332	u753	m48	MAX	I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
L154331	u754	m48	NORMAL	What about this?
L154330	u753	m48	MAX	Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
L154329	u754	m48	NORMAL	Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
L153998	u753	m48	MAX	I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
L153997	u754	m48	NORMAL	You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
L153996	u753	m48	MAX	How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
L153995	u754	m48	NORMAL	For a change.
L153994	u753	m48	MAX	He's sick.
L153993	u754	m48	NORMAL	And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
L153992	u753	m48	MAX	I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
L153991	u754	m48	NORMAL	More like deployed in bed asleep.
L153990	u753	m48	MAX	What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
L153989	u754	m48	NORMAL	I want you on call here.
L153988	u753	m48	MAX	I was on call. 
L153987	u754	m48	NORMAL	This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
L195847	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I think I found something...
L195846	u879	m57	COOPER	Justin?
L195845	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Holy shit...
L195842	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
L195841	u879	m57	COOPER	Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
L195840	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
L195839	u879	m57	COOPER	...do you copy?
L195767	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
L195766	u879	m57	COOPER	You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
L195674	u882	m57	JUSTIN	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
L195673	u879	m57	COOPER	I can see why they sent you along.
L195651	u879	m57	COOPER	I heard it.
L195650	u882	m57	JUSTIN	That means top-secret, Cooper.
L195645	u879	m57	COOPER	I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
L195644	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Ballast.
L196373	u884	m57	MILLER	It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
L196372	u879	m57	COOPER	Will it work?
L196371	u884	m57	MILLER	You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
L196370	u879	m57	COOPER	...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
L196239	u884	m57	MILLER	On my way.
L196238	u879	m57	COOPER	Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
L196127	u884	m57	MILLER	I'll get him.
L196126	u879	m57	COOPER	But Justin...
L195894	u884	m57	MILLER	Hold on, Coop...
L195893	u879	m57	COOPER	The containment, Second Containment...
L195892	u884	m57	MILLER	Coop, where are you...
L195891	u879	m57	COOPER	We have a man down...
L195764	u879	m57	COOPER	I'll be all over it.
L195763	u884	m57	MILLER	You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
L195762	u879	m57	COOPER	...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
L195693	u884	m57	MILLER	You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
L195692	u879	m57	COOPER	From what?
L195658	u884	m57	MILLER	EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
L195657	u879	m57	COOPER	...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
L195643	u884	m57	MILLER	This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
L195642	u879	m57	COOPER	You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
L195641	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
L195588	u884	m57	MILLER	Don't start with me, Cooper.
L195587	u879	m57	COOPER	Time to play Spam in the can.
L196302	u886	m57	SMITH	Roger that.
L196301	u879	m57	COOPER	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
L196300	u879	m57	COOPER	Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
L196243	u879	m57	COOPER	We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
L196242	u886	m57	SMITH	It's holding... She's holding...!
L196119	u886	m57	SMITH	What about the accumulator...?
L196118	u879	m57	COOPER	We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
L195991	u879	m57	COOPER	You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
L195990	u886	m57	SMITH	You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
L195989	u879	m57	COOPER	Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
L195988	u886	m57	SMITH	You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
L195987	u879	m57	COOPER	What?
L195986	u886	m57	SMITH	I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
L195985	u879	m57	COOPER	You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
L195964	u879	m57	COOPER	"I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking ""optical effect!"""
L195963	u888	m57	WEIR	What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
L195962	u879	m57	COOPER	I'm telling you, I saw it...
L195961	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know what happened to Justin.
L195958	u888	m57	WEIR	Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
L195957	u879	m57	COOPER	You weren't there. I saw it.
L195956	u888	m57	WEIR	No, he didn't.
L195955	u879	m57	COOPER	It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
L195695	u879	m57	COOPER	Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
L195694	u888	m57	WEIR	The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
L195630	u888	m57	WEIR	No, thank you.
L195629	u879	m57	COOPER	Coffee.
L195628	u888	m57	WEIR	What?
L195627	u879	m57	COOPER	Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
L196384	u887	m57	STARCK	Run!
L196383	u879	m57	COOPER	What...?
L196379	u887	m57	STARCK	Hurry.
L196378	u879	m57	COOPER	I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
L196366	u879	m57	COOPER	I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
L196365	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
L196364	u879	m57	COOPER	Can you shut it down?
L196363	u887	m57	STARCK	There must be a way! What about Engineering?
L196362	u879	m57	COOPER	How? The Bridge is gone.
L196358	u887	m57	STARCK	You're okay now, it's over...
L196357	u879	m57	COOPER	Let me breathe, let me breathe...
L195867	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know, the screens are dead...!
L195866	u879	m57	COOPER	What's happening?
L195597	u887	m57	STARCK	It is not.
L195596	u879	m57	COOPER	Is that an offer?
L196337	u884	m57	MILLER	Oh God...
L196336	u880	m57	DJ	Please... kill...
L196335	u884	m57	MILLER	Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
L196334	u880	m57	DJ	Please...
L196323	u884	m57	MILLER	Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
L196322	u880	m57	DJ	What happened?
L196321	u884	m57	MILLER	DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
L196237	u880	m57	DJ	No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
L196236	u884	m57	MILLER	Save yourself. From Hell.  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
L196235	u880	m57	DJ	"It sounds like ""ex infera:"" ""ex,"" from; ""infera,"" the ablative case of ""inferi."" ""Hell."""
L196234	u884	m57	MILLER	Hear what?
L196233	u880	m57	DJ	Do you hear it? Right there.
L196231	u880	m57	DJ	It gets worse.
L196230	u884	m57	MILLER	It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
L196229	u880	m57	DJ	"They thought it said, ""Liberatis me,"" ""Save me,"" but it's not ""me."" It's ""tutemet:"" ""Save yourself."""
L196228	u884	m57	MILLER	Go on.
L196227	u880	m57	DJ	I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
L196226	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it?
L196225	u880	m57	DJ	No.
L196224	u884	m57	MILLER	I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
L196222	u880	m57	DJ	Another man? Who?
L196221	u884	m57	MILLER	Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
L196190	u884	m57	MILLER	We'll make it.
L196189	u880	m57	DJ	He'll live... if we ever make it back.
L196076	u884	m57	MILLER	I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
L196075	u880	m57	DJ	To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
L196048	u884	m57	MILLER	Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
L196047	u880	m57	DJ	Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
L195941	u880	m57	DJ	His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
L195940	u884	m57	MILLER	How is he?
L195919	u884	m57	MILLER	No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
L195918	u880	m57	DJ	We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
L195648	u884	m57	MILLER	And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
L195647	u880	m57	DJ	Trauma.
L195646	u884	m57	MILLER	He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
L196188	u880	m57	DJ	One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
L196187	u885	m57	PETERS	His peritoneum has ruptured...
L196186	u880	m57	DJ	Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
L196184	u880	m57	DJ	He's crashing...
L196183	u885	m57	PETERS	90 over 50 and falling... .
L196182	u880	m57	DJ	Pressure?
L196181	u885	m57	PETERS	I've got a pulse, he's alive...
L196100	u885	m57	PETERS	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
L196099	u880	m57	DJ	What's wrong?
L196023	u880	m57	DJ	A power drain --
L196022	u885	m57	PETERS	What's happening...?
L195984	u885	m57	PETERS	Nothing. It's nothing.
L195983	u880	m57	DJ	What's wrong?
L195564	u881	m57	HOLLIS	Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
L195563	u888	m57	WEIR	Thank you.
L195562	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
L195551	u888	m57	WEIR	A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
L195550	u881	m57	HOLLIS	That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
L195549	u888	m57	WEIR	It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
L195548	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
L195547	u888	m57	WEIR	Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
L195545	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
L195544	u888	m57	WEIR	You wanted to see me, Admiral?
L195575	u883	m57	LYLE	The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
L195574	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
L195573	u883	m57	LYLE	Some things you don't get over.
L195572	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
L195571	u883	m57	LYLE	He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
L195570	u881	m57	HOLLIS	What's on your mind?
L195569	u883	m57	LYLE	Does he know that?
L195568	u881	m57	HOLLIS	That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
L195567	u883	m57	LYLE	The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
L195566	u881	m57	HOLLIS	You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
L195565	u883	m57	LYLE	You're not seriously considering sending him?
L195557	u883	m57	LYLE	Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
L195556	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
L196160	u885	m57	PETERS	Starck!
L196159	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Oh my god OH MY GOD...
L196148	u882	m57	JUSTIN	From the Other Place...
L196147	u885	m57	PETERS	The dark inside...? I don't understand.
L196146	u882	m57	JUSTIN	...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
L196145	u882	m57	JUSTIN	The dark inside me.
L196144	u885	m57	PETERS	What does?
L196143	u882	m57	JUSTIN	It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
L196142	u885	m57	PETERS	What, Justin, what shows you?
L195827	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'm going in.
L195826	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
L195825	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
L195802	u888	m57	WEIR	Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
L195801	u882	m57	JUSTIN	We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
L195800	u888	m57	WEIR	You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
L195672	u888	m57	WEIR	I built it.
L195671	u882	m57	JUSTIN	How do you know all this?
L195670	u888	m57	WEIR	...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
L196174	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin. I won't let you die.
L196173	u882	m57	JUSTIN	But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
L196172	u884	m57	MILLER	You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
L196171	u882	m57	JUSTIN	...I don't want to die...!
L196167	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Skipper, you gotta help me...
L196166	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin.
L196165	u884	m57	MILLER	Patch me through to him.
L195854	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
L195853	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin, finish your sweep.
L195755	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Yes, sir!
L195754	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
L195583	u884	m57	MILLER	Start the countdown.
L195582	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
L195561	u888	m57	WEIR	Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
L195560	u883	m57	LYLE	The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
L195559	u888	m57	WEIR	The crew? Could they still be alive?
L195558	u883	m57	LYLE	Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
L195555	u888	m57	WEIR	This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
L195554	u883	m57	LYLE	I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
L195553	u888	m57	WEIR	I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
L195552	u883	m57	LYLE	Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
L195543	u883	m57	LYLE	Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
L195542	u888	m57	WEIR	This is Weir.
L196194	u884	m57	MILLER	Thanks.
L196193	u885	m57	PETERS	I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
L196192	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
L196115	u885	m57	PETERS	Justin.
L196114	u884	m57	MILLER	That's a negative, Starck.
L196021	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it.
L196020	u885	m57	PETERS	I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
L195947	u884	m57	MILLER	Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
L195946	u885	m57	PETERS	I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
L195945	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
L195890	u885	m57	PETERS	Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
L195889	u884	m57	MILLER	...you okay?
L195888	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters...
L195887	u885	m57	PETERS	Skipper...
L195886	u884	m57	MILLER	Can anybody hear me...
L195852	u885	m57	PETERS	Crystallized.
L195851	u884	m57	MILLER	...how's the client?
L195850	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
L195831	u885	m57	PETERS	Frozen.
L195830	u884	m57	MILLER	Alive?
L195829	u885	m57	PETERS	I found one.
L195819	u884	m57	MILLER	The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
L195818	u885	m57	PETERS	Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
L195817	u884	m57	MILLER	What you got, Peters?
L195816	u885	m57	PETERS	Okay. I'm on the bridge.
L195812	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one here, Skipper.
L195811	u884	m57	MILLER	The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
L195792	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, you still showing those readings?
L195791	u885	m57	PETERS	I can see the hatch.
L195788	u885	m57	PETERS	I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
L195787	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters is right, no one's here.
L195783	u884	m57	MILLER	So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
L195782	u885	m57	PETERS	That means they didn't abandon ship.
L195773	u884	m57	MILLER	Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
L195772	u885	m57	PETERS	Jesus its huge.
L195771	u884	m57	MILLER	Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
L195770	u885	m57	PETERS	We've got pressure.
L195595	u884	m57	MILLER	I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
L195594	u885	m57	PETERS	No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
L195593	u884	m57	MILLER	I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
L195592	u885	m57	PETERS	Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
L195591	u884	m57	MILLER	What's the hold up?
L196428	u888	m57	WEIR	NOOO!
L196427	u884	m57	MILLER	You can't have them. Go to hell.
L196425	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck... Cooper...
L196424	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
L196423	u884	m57	MILLER	You're lying...!
L196422	u888	m57	WEIR	There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
L196417	u888	m57	WEIR	Better if I just show you.
L196416	u884	m57	MILLER	Then what, what are you? Tell me...
L196415	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm not the Devil.
L196414	u884	m57	MILLER	You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
L196413	u888	m57	WEIR	You know.
L196412	u884	m57	MILLER	What are you?
L196401	u888	m57	WEIR	Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
L196400	u884	m57	MILLER	Then who the fuck are you?
L196399	u888	m57	WEIR	Weir is dead.
L196348	u888	m57	WEIR	What makes you think I'll miss?
L196347	u884	m57	MILLER	If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
L196343	u888	m57	WEIR	Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
L196342	u884	m57	MILLER	What are you talking about?
L196341	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
L196340	u884	m57	MILLER	Your eyes...
L196332	u884	m57	MILLER	Son of a bitch!
L196331	u888	m57	WEIR	I told you... She won't let you leave...
L196272	u884	m57	MILLER	Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
L196271	u888	m57	WEIR	You can't leave. She won't let you.
L196265	u884	m57	MILLER	Watch me.
L196264	u888	m57	WEIR	You... You can't do that!
L196263	u884	m57	MILLER	We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
L196262	u888	m57	WEIR	What about my ship?
L196258	u884	m57	MILLER	It's done.
L196257	u888	m57	WEIR	Don't... don't do this...
L196256	u884	m57	MILLER	Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
L196255	u888	m57	WEIR	You're insane. You've lost your mind.
L196254	u884	m57	MILLER	...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship. The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
L196253	u888	m57	WEIR	You can't, your orders are specific...
L196252	u884	m57	MILLER	We're leaving.
L196217	u884	m57	MILLER	That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
L196216	u888	m57	WEIR	I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
L196215	u884	m57	MILLER	"The ""Other Place,"" what is that...?"
L196214	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know...
L196213	u884	m57	MILLER	Where has it been for the past seven years?
L196212	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know...
L196211	u884	m57	MILLER	To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
L196210	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes...
L196209	u884	m57	MILLER	You said this ship creates a gateway...
L196208	u888	m57	WEIR	What do you want me to say?
L196207	u884	m57	MILLER	That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
L196206	u888	m57	WEIR	Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
L196205	u884	m57	MILLER	I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
L196198	u888	m57	WEIR	Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
L196197	u884	m57	MILLER	"Is that your ""expert opinion?"" The only answer we've had out of you is ""I don't know."""
L196074	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it.
L196073	u888	m57	WEIR	I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
L196072	u884	m57	MILLER	We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
L196031	u888	m57	WEIR	Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
L196030	u884	m57	MILLER	We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
L196025	u888	m57	WEIR	The Core...!
L196024	u884	m57	MILLER	We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
L196019	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know.
L196018	u884	m57	MILLER	What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
L196009	u888	m57	WEIR	Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
L196008	u884	m57	MILLER	Explanation?
L196005	u888	m57	WEIR	Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
L196004	u884	m57	MILLER	It's 2041...
L196003	u888	m57	WEIR	The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
L196002	u884	m57	MILLER	What about it?
L196001	u888	m57	WEIR	The date.
L196000	u884	m57	MILLER	You have something, Dr. Weir?
L195979	u884	m57	MILLER	Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
L195978	u888	m57	WEIR	There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
L195977	u884	m57	MILLER	I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
L195976	u888	m57	WEIR	If it worked, yes.
L195975	u884	m57	MILLER	If it worked.
L195974	u888	m57	WEIR	Insane? The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
L195973	u884	m57	MILLER	It's insane.
L195969	u884	m57	MILLER	How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
L195968	u888	m57	WEIR	It's complicated...
L195967	u884	m57	MILLER	What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
L195966	u888	m57	WEIR	It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
L195965	u884	m57	MILLER	"Hold on, what's this ""gravitational distortion?"""
L195953	u884	m57	MILLER	One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
L195952	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195910	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
L195909	u888	m57	WEIR	It beats dying, Mister Smith.
L195799	u884	m57	MILLER	They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
L195798	u888	m57	WEIR	No one?
L195797	u884	m57	MILLER	Negative.
L195796	u888	m57	WEIR	Any survivors?
L195790	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
L195789	u884	m57	MILLER	Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
L195781	u888	m57	WEIR	In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
L195780	u884	m57	MILLER	I can see that, what're they for?
L195775	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
L195774	u888	m57	WEIR	You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
L195760	u884	m57	MILLER	-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
L195759	u888	m57	WEIR	That is not acceptable --
L195758	u884	m57	MILLER	Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
L195757	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
L195756	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
L195742	u888	m57	WEIR	Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
L195741	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
L195740	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
L195689	u888	m57	WEIR	NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
L195688	u884	m57	MILLER	What does it say?
L195677	u888	m57	WEIR	That's what we're here to find out.
L195676	u884	m57	MILLER	Where has it been for the last seven years?
L195675	u888	m57	WEIR	It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
L195601	u884	m57	MILLER	Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
L195600	u888	m57	WEIR	I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
L195599	u884	m57	MILLER	Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
L195598	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
L195590	u884	m57	MILLER	The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
L195589	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, I just want to say...
L196315	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
L196314	u886	m57	SMITH	Where is it, where is it...
L196313	u884	m57	MILLER	Get out of there now!
L196312	u886	m57	SMITH	No, no, we just got her back together...
L196311	u884	m57	MILLER	Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
L196310	u884	m57	MILLER	One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
L196309	u886	m57	SMITH	Come again, Skipper?
L196308	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, get out of there...
L196307	u886	m57	SMITH	I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
L196306	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it, Smith?
L196305	u886	m57	SMITH	Skipper...
L196286	u884	m57	MILLER	Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
L196285	u886	m57	SMITH	She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
L196284	u884	m57	MILLER	Now what?
L196283	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain, we got a problem.
L196282	u884	m57	MILLER	Thank you.
L196071	u884	m57	MILLER	Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
L196070	u886	m57	SMITH	Sir.
L196064	u884	m57	MILLER	That's enough!
L196063	u886	m57	SMITH	...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
L195939	u886	m57	SMITH	Understood.
L195938	u884	m57	MILLER	We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
L195937	u886	m57	SMITH	I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
L195936	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
L195935	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain Miller, you copy?
L195912	u884	m57	MILLER	You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
L195911	u886	m57	SMITH	But...
L195903	u886	m57	SMITH	They're gone.
L195902	u884	m57	MILLER	No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
L195901	u886	m57	SMITH	We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
L195900	u886	m57	SMITH	We don't have time to fart.
L195899	u884	m57	MILLER	Do we have enough time for a weld?
L195897	u886	m57	SMITH	We have a situation here...
L195896	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
L195895	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain Miller...
L195744	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, give me a read.
L195743	u886	m57	SMITH	It is now.  We're locked in.
L195735	u886	m57	SMITH	Love to.
L195734	u884	m57	MILLER	Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
L195726	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck...
L195725	u886	m57	SMITH	Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
L195722	u884	m57	MILLER	Where is it?
L195721	u886	m57	SMITH	1500 meters. We're getting too close...
L195717	u884	m57	MILLER	I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
L195716	u886	m57	SMITH	We've got some weather.
L195712	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir...!
L195711	u886	m57	SMITH	Yes, sir.
L195710	u884	m57	MILLER	I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
L195709	u886	m57	SMITH	Something like that, yeah.
L195708	u884	m57	MILLER	"What are you trying to say? ""If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"""
L195707	u886	m57	SMITH	That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
L195706	u884	m57	MILLER	We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
L195703	u884	m57	MILLER	Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
L195702	u886	m57	SMITH	We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
L195701	u886	m57	SMITH	One-four degrees...
L195700	u884	m57	MILLER	...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
L195699	u886	m57	SMITH	Heading three-three-four...
L195683	u884	m57	MILLER	What is that?
L195682	u886	m57	SMITH	Jesus...
L195579	u886	m57	SMITH	Locked and cocked.
L195578	u884	m57	MILLER	I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
L196395	u884	m57	MILLER	He's dead...
L196394	u887	m57	STARCK	Weir.
L196388	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
L196387	u884	m57	MILLER	...repeat, we're armed...
L196386	u884	m57	MILLER	We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
L196375	u884	m57	MILLER	No. I'll be right back.
L196374	u887	m57	STARCK	I'll do it --
L196369	u884	m57	MILLER	We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
L196368	u887	m57	STARCK	Blow it up?
L196367	u884	m57	MILLER	BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
L196361	u887	m57	STARCK	We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
L196360	u884	m57	MILLER	Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
L196354	u884	m57	MILLER	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
L196353	u887	m57	STARCK	Weir can't be alive.
L196177	u887	m57	STARCK	Five seconds.
L196176	u884	m57	MILLER	Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
L196134	u887	m57	STARCK	You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
L196133	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm on my way, Starck.
L196125	u884	m57	MILLER	Stay here! Don't stop working!
L196124	u887	m57	STARCK	He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
L196123	u884	m57	MILLER	What?
L196122	u887	m57	STARCK	Justin's in the airlock.
L196121	u884	m57	MILLER	What's going on in there, Starck?
L196120	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, come in...
L196096	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
L196095	u887	m57	STARCK	Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
L196094	u884	m57	MILLER	What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
L196093	u887	m57	STARCK	I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
L196092	u884	m57	MILLER	If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
L196091	u887	m57	STARCK	I know that.
L196090	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
L196089	u887	m57	STARCK	It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
L196088	u884	m57	MILLER	We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
L196087	u887	m57	STARCK	I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
L196086	u884	m57	MILLER	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
L196085	u887	m57	STARCK	You've got to listen...
L196083	u887	m57	STARCK	There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
L196082	u884	m57	MILLER	Go ahead.
L196081	u887	m57	STARCK	I've got a theory.
L196080	u884	m57	MILLER	...bio-readings of indeterminate origin, don't you have anything useful to tell me?
L196079	u887	m57	STARCK	...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
L196078	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it, Starck?
L196077	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller...
L196052	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
L196051	u887	m57	STARCK	Who?
L196050	u884	m57	MILLER	No. It was someone else.
L196049	u887	m57	STARCK	Maybe one of the original crew?
L195951	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it. Dr. Weir...
L195950	u887	m57	STARCK	I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
L195949	u884	m57	MILLER	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
L195948	u887	m57	STARCK	What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
L195933	u884	m57	MILLER	So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
L195932	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
L195931	u884	m57	MILLER	What's causing the readings?
L195930	u887	m57	STARCK	"The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: ""Bio-readings of indeterminate origin."" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels."
L195929	u884	m57	MILLER	What about the life readings you picked up?
L195928	u887	m57	STARCK	I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
L195927	u884	m57	MILLER	We can take the filters from the Clark...
L195926	u887	m57	STARCK	It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
L195925	u884	m57	MILLER	Carbon dioxide?
L195924	u887	m57	STARCK	Oxygen is not the problem.
L195923	u884	m57	MILLER	How much oh-two do we have?
L195922	u887	m57	STARCK	The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
L195921	u884	m57	MILLER	But you can breathe it.
L195920	u887	m57	STARCK	It tastes bad.
L195917	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
L195916	u887	m57	STARCK	We're all here.
L195915	u884	m57	MILLER	Everybody okay?
L195794	u884	m57	MILLER	Keep your eyes open.
L195793	u887	m57	STARCK	That's an affirmative.
L195751	u887	m57	STARCK	There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
L195750	u884	m57	MILLER	Radiation interference?
L195749	u887	m57	STARCK	Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
L195698	u884	m57	MILLER	Come around to three-three-four...
L195697	u887	m57	STARCK	Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
L195635	u884	m57	MILLER	Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
L195634	u887	m57	STARCK	I just finished drying...
L195633	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
L195585	u884	m57	MILLER	Let's go.
L195584	u887	m57	STARCK	Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
L195581	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin?
L195580	u887	m57	STARCK	We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
L196057	u885	m57	PETERS	I've seen bodies before. This is different.
L196056	u888	m57	WEIR	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
L196055	u885	m57	PETERS	About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
L196054	u885	m57	PETERS	I did.
L196053	u888	m57	WEIR	No. I saw nothing.
L195810	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one here.
L195809	u888	m57	WEIR	Can you see a body?
L195808	u885	m57	PETERS	Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
L195807	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
L195804	u888	m57	WEIR	You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
L195803	u885	m57	PETERS	Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
L195779	u888	m57	WEIR	They're explosive charges.
L195778	u885	m57	PETERS	Here's another one. They're all over the place.
L195624	u885	m57	PETERS	DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
L195623	u888	m57	WEIR	Claire...
L195608	u885	m57	PETERS	They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
L195607	u888	m57	WEIR	Wasn't that ship destroyed?
L195606	u885	m57	PETERS	He served on the Goliath.
L195605	u888	m57	WEIR	He's been past Mars?
L195604	u885	m57	PETERS	Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
L195603	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195602	u885	m57	PETERS	First time in a grav couch?
L196248	u885	m57	PETERS	I don't care.
L196247	u887	m57	STARCK	It's cold.
L196246	u885	m57	PETERS	You got any coffee?
L196164	u887	m57	STARCK	Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
L196163	u885	m57	PETERS	We have to do something, oh God...
L196154	u885	m57	PETERS	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
L196153	u887	m57	STARCK	Almost got it.
L196139	u885	m57	PETERS	Do you know what it was?
L196138	u887	m57	STARCK	Keep him talking.
L196137	u885	m57	PETERS	Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
L196129	u885	m57	PETERS	Can you shut it down?
L196128	u887	m57	STARCK	He's engaged the override.
L195786	u887	m57	STARCK	Not according to the computer.
L195785	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one in the corridor but us.
L196061	u886	m57	SMITH	Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
L196060	u888	m57	WEIR	Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
L196059	u886	m57	SMITH	I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
L195906	u888	m57	WEIR	It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
L195905	u886	m57	SMITH	What?
L195884	u888	m57	WEIR	We're losing atmosphere...
L195883	u886	m57	SMITH	The safety circuit's failed!
L195849	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
L195848	u886	m57	SMITH	What the hell is that?
L195738	u886	m57	SMITH	Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
L195737	u888	m57	WEIR	Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
L195731	u888	m57	WEIR	She's not ugly.
L195730	u886	m57	SMITH	Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
L195715	u886	m57	SMITH	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
L195714	u888	m57	WEIR	Where is she?
L195667	u888	m57	WEIR	"Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from ""point A"" here...  ...to ""point B,"" here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?"
L195666	u886	m57	SMITH	Hey...
L195908	u886	m57	SMITH	I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
L195907	u887	m57	STARCK	What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
L195865	u887	m57	STARCK	I'm trying, goddammit --
L195864	u886	m57	SMITH	Get them back --
L195863	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, do you read me, Peters --
L195834	u887	m57	STARCK	Decompression wouldn't do that.
L195833	u886	m57	SMITH	Explosive decompression.
L195832	u887	m57	STARCK	What happened to his eyes?
L195733	u887	m57	STARCK	Picking up magnetic interference.
L195732	u886	m57	SMITH	Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
L195724	u886	m57	SMITH	1000 meters...
L195723	u887	m57	STARCK	The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
L195719	u886	m57	SMITH	Range 3000 meters and closing.
L195718	u887	m57	STARCK	If they are, they're screening their calls.
L195705	u886	m57	SMITH	Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
L195704	u887	m57	STARCK	This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
L195661	u887	m57	STARCK	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
L195660	u886	m57	SMITH	You can't do that.
L195639	u887	m57	STARCK	All boards are green, everything's five by five.
L195638	u886	m57	SMITH	30 hours to Neptune orbit.
L195577	u887	m57	STARCK	Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
L195576	u886	m57	SMITH	I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
L196196	u888	m57	WEIR	It means nothing.
L196195	u887	m57	STARCK	"Justin said something about, ""The dark inside me..."" What did he mean?"
L196113	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
L196112	u888	m57	WEIR	The forward airlock.
L196111	u887	m57	STARCK	What is it?
L196110	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm alright. Please.
L196109	u887	m57	STARCK	In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
L196107	u888	m57	WEIR	It wants me. I have to go.
L196106	u887	m57	STARCK	What are you doing?
L196007	u888	m57	WEIR	No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
L196006	u887	m57	STARCK	Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
L195998	u887	m57	STARCK	I'm sorry.
L195997	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
L195996	u887	m57	STARCK	It must be hard, being so far away from her.
L195995	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195994	u887	m57	STARCK	Claire is your wife?
L195993	u888	m57	WEIR	Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
L195992	u887	m57	STARCK	Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
L195972	u887	m57	STARCK	I can't believe we built this.
L195971	u888	m57	WEIR	That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
L195859	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
L195858	u888	m57	WEIR	What is it?
L195822	u888	m57	WEIR	Ship's log.
L195821	u887	m57	STARCK	What is it?
L195753	u887	m57	STARCK	If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
L195752	u888	m57	WEIR	Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
L195747	u887	m57	STARCK	Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
L195746	u888	m57	WEIR	Do they have pressure?
L195745	u887	m57	STARCK	The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
L195669	u888	m57	WEIR	Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
L195668	u887	m57	STARCK	A straight line.
L195664	u888	m57	WEIR	Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
L195663	u887	m57	STARCK	How?
L195662	u888	m57	WEIR	"Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously ""jump"" from one point in the universe to another, light years away."
L211194	u926	m61	ADULTERER	They'll get in! We'll all die!
L211193	u939	m61	TRAMPY	YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
L211189	u926	m61	ADULTERER	They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
L211188	u939	m61	TRAMPY	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
L211187	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Stop!
L210904	u939	m61	TRAMPY	I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
L210903	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Spare me.
L210902	u939	m61	TRAMPY	It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
L211396	u926	m61	ADULTERER	I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
L211395	u935	m61	HEROINE	Where is everyone?
L211394	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
L211388	u935	m61	HEROINE	We're going to get my little girl.
L211387	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Where are you two going?
L211382	u926	m61	ADULTERER	I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
L211381	u935	m61	HEROINE	We'll meet in three hours?
L211380	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
L211379	u935	m61	HEROINE	You know where it is?
L211377	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
L211376	u935	m61	HEROINE	They'll be back.
L211375	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
L211301	u935	m61	HEROINE	He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
L211300	u926	m61	ADULTERER	We should go! We should go right now!
L211192	u935	m61	HEROINE	Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
L211191	u926	m61	ADULTERER	I will not die because of him!
L210832	u926	m61	ADULTERER	I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
L210831	u935	m61	HEROINE	Careful.
L210720	u926	m61	ADULTERER	Right.
L210719	u935	m61	HEROINE	We can't risk letting them in.
L210718	u926	m61	ADULTERER	You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
L210847	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	With what just happened upstairs --
L210846	u927	m61	BARTENDER	I don't think you should...
L210805	u927	m61	BARTENDER	I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
L210804	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
L210758	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	But it's got teeth.
L210757	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Well, it don't look pretty.
L210644	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Her fella.
L210643	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
L210641	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Nah, I got the gun.
L210640	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
L210639	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Yeah.
L210638	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	IS IT CLEAR?!
L211203	u928	m61	BEER GUY	We're lucky to be alive.
L211202	u927	m61	BARTENDER	We shot a skunk.
L211139	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
L211138	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Stop it.
L210952	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Anyone.
L210951	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Who the hell would you call?
L210950	u928	m61	BEER GUY	I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
L210551	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Gonna stay for a couple?
L210550	u928	m61	BEER GUY	One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
L211252	u931	m61	BOZO	You gotta be with me on this.
L211251	u927	m61	BARTENDER	"Well, your last words can be ""I told you so."""
L211250	u931	m61	BOZO	We'll be food, dickheads!
L211246	u931	m61	BOZO	If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
L211245	u927	m61	BARTENDER	You got something better?
L211008	u931	m61	BOZO	OPEN THE DOOR!
L211007	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Wha?
L211005	u931	m61	BOZO	"OH!? WHAT IS ""OH?"" What does ""oh"" mean?"
L211004	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Oh!
L210989	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Come on, come on.
L210988	u931	m61	BOZO	Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
L210958	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Upstairs.
L210957	u931	m61	BOZO	Where's that?
L210956	u927	m61	BARTENDER	I think I know where a CB is.
L210601	u931	m61	BOZO	C'mon guys--
L210600	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Hey! Get quiet or get out.
L211261	u935	m61	HEROINE	Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
L211260	u927	m61	BARTENDER	You seem mighty collected about this.
L211157	u935	m61	HEROINE	Just move!
L211156	u927	m61	BARTENDER	I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
L211124	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Shit!
L211123	u935	m61	HEROINE	We just smeared a skunk.
L211083	u927	m61	BARTENDER	In the corner, behind the curtain.
L211082	u935	m61	HEROINE	Where's the tunnel?
L211081	u935	m61	HEROINE	Follow me.
L211080	u927	m61	BARTENDER	You all sure about this?
L211059	u927	m61	BARTENDER	This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
L211058	u935	m61	HEROINE	This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
L211057	u927	m61	BARTENDER	What!? I'm not going down there again!
L211056	u935	m61	HEROINE	HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
L211033	u935	m61	HEROINE	What's it for?
L211032	u927	m61	BARTENDER	It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
L211031	u935	m61	HEROINE	What tunnel? Where?
L211030	u927	m61	BARTENDER	There's a tunnel.
L211029	u935	m61	HEROINE	Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
L210992	u935	m61	HEROINE	Easy.
L210991	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
L210977	u935	m61	HEROINE	Hey!
L210976	u927	m61	BARTENDER	They're right here.
L210792	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Well, justice is funny.
L210791	u935	m61	HEROINE	No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
L210790	u927	m61	BARTENDER	So, your husband ditched you?
L210788	u927	m61	BARTENDER	And the head?
L210787	u935	m61	HEROINE	And that's how I ended up here.
L210666	u935	m61	HEROINE	Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
L210665	u927	m61	BARTENDER	And the rest of 'em?
L210664	u935	m61	HEROINE	That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
L211143	u937	m61	ROADIE	Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
L211142	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Just an observation.
L211141	u937	m61	ROADIE	That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
L211122	u937	m61	ROADIE	Look.
L211121	u927	m61	BARTENDER	What?
L211120	u937	m61	ROADIE	Ohhh.
L211097	u937	m61	ROADIE	The door... on three.
L211096	u927	m61	BARTENDER	I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
L211095	u937	m61	ROADIE	Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
L211094	u927	m61	BARTENDER	No. You?
L211093	u937	m61	ROADIE	Scared?
L211055	u927	m61	BARTENDER	Get in line!
L211054	u937	m61	ROADIE	Fuck you too.
L211053	u927	m61	BARTENDER	You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
L211208	u928	m61	BEER GUY	My truck.
L211207	u931	m61	BOZO	What now, Geronimo?
L211181	u931	m61	BOZO	He's dead.
L211180	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Come on!
L210969	u931	m61	BOZO	Who's with me?
L210968	u928	m61	BEER GUY	We're better off.
L210955	u931	m61	BOZO	Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
L210954	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Well then I guess we should just give up.
L210953	u931	m61	BOZO	Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
L210854	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Oh yeah?
L210853	u931	m61	BOZO	I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
L210752	u931	m61	BOZO	Go douche.
L210751	u928	m61	BEER GUY	You weren't helpin'.
L210750	u931	m61	BOZO	Any more ideas Animal Planet?
L210707	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Fuck no.
L210706	u931	m61	BOZO	Why don't you go check it out?
L210705	u928	m61	BEER GUY	So, what now? Did those things leave?
L210875	u936	m61	PARA	We lived near power lines.
L210874	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Your parents of relation?
L210873	u936	m61	PARA	Yep.
L210872	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Your brother, huh?
L210871	u936	m61	PARA	Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
L210870	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Why do you take shit from him?
L211256	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Just cover me. It was built to move.
L211255	u935	m61	HEROINE	It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
L211239	u935	m61	HEROINE	But not flush against the tunnel?
L211238	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
L211233	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Nothing, this was my last delivery.
L211232	u935	m61	HEROINE	What's in the back?
L211231	u928	m61	BEER GUY	My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
L211226	u928	m61	BEER GUY	Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
L211225	u935	m61	HEROINE	All right!  Tell us about the truck!
L211130	u935	m61	HEROINE	What?
L211129	u928	m61	BEER GUY	We gotta be close.
L211070	u935	m61	HEROINE	Anybody else?
L211069	u928	m61	BEER GUY	We gotta try.
L211068	u935	m61	HEROINE	We're going to get help.
L211061	u935	m61	HEROINE	Anyone else?
L211060	u928	m61	BEER GUY	I'm in.
L210941	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
L210940	u929	m61	BELLE	What? Really?
L210939	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
L210938	u929	m61	BELLE	How much you got to see the show?
L210937	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	How much I got, what?
L210936	u929	m61	BELLE	How much you got?
L210935	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Sure.
L210934	u929	m61	BELLE	You wanna see, baby?
L210931	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	The girl's got rhythm.
L210930	u929	m61	BELLE	Um-hmmm.
L210927	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	I can't feel a thing, Hon.
L210926	u929	m61	BELLE	Doesn't your foot hurt?
L210895	u929	m61	BELLE	Okay then.
L210894	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	It's much safer in there, sweety.
L210893	u929	m61	BELLE	But --
L210892	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
L210891	u929	m61	BELLE	Why not then?
L210890	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
L210889	u929	m61	BELLE	Will I go crazy or something?
L210888	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
L210887	u929	m61	BELLE	Really?
L210886	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
L210885	u929	m61	BELLE	Oh, no.
L210884	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Magic potion.  You should try a little.
L210883	u929	m61	BELLE	What is this?
L210882	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
L210881	u929	m61	BELLE	Oh.
L210880	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Push and twist, it's child proof.
L210878	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Well...
L210877	u929	m61	BELLE	How are you holding up?
L211051	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
L211050	u935	m61	HEROINE	Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
L211049	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
L211048	u935	m61	HEROINE	Keys.
L211047	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Seven.
L211046	u935	m61	HEROINE	Nine?
L211045	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Seven.
L211044	u935	m61	HEROINE	Max?
L211043	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Holds four.
L211042	u935	m61	HEROINE	How many?
L211041	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Covered.
L211040	u935	m61	HEROINE	Open?
L211039	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Two.
L211038	u935	m61	HEROINE	Four door?
L211037	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Fully.
L211036	u935	m61	HEROINE	Is it gassed up?
L211035	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
L211034	u935	m61	HEROINE	What's it for!?
L211026	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Nothing.
L211025	u935	m61	HEROINE	What's going on between you two?
L211024	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Huh?
L211023	u935	m61	HEROINE	What do you mean what?
L211022	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	What?
L211021	u935	m61	HEROINE	What?
L210961	u935	m61	HEROINE	You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
L210960	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
L210840	u935	m61	HEROINE	No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
L210839	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	In the kitchen, under the sink.
L210761	u935	m61	HEROINE	Good.
L210760	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
L210759	u935	m61	HEROINE	Will these boards hold?
L210656	u935	m61	HEROINE	He shot you the other time.
L210655	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Huh?
L210654	u935	m61	HEROINE	He only shot you once.
L210653	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
L210652	u935	m61	HEROINE	Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
L210651	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
L210648	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	What?
L210647	u935	m61	HEROINE	He's dead.
L210646	u930	m61	BOSS MAN	Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
L210645	u935	m61	HEROINE	My husband...
L210971	u931	m61	BOZO	What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
L210970	u934	m61	GRANDPA	I'll go with ya.
L210830	u931	m61	BOZO	They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
L210829	u934	m61	GRANDPA	I wouldn't do that, son.
L210814	u931	m61	BOZO	I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
L210813	u934	m61	GRANDPA	Sit still, look less like a meal.
L210812	u931	m61	BOZO	Oh? And what's that?
L210811	u934	m61	GRANDPA	You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
L210587	u931	m61	BOZO	Whoa!
L210586	u934	m61	GRANDPA	This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
L210583	u934	m61	GRANDPA	Get outta here.
L210582	u931	m61	BOZO	What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
L211338	u937	m61	ROADIE	Clear!
L211337	u931	m61	BOZO	Blow the goddamn hatch!
L211274	u931	m61	BOZO	What the hell's going on here!?
L211273	u937	m61	ROADIE	Clever fuckers.
L211248	u931	m61	BOZO	No bullshit.
L211247	u937	m61	ROADIE	Bullshit.
L211244	u931	m61	BOZO	Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
L211243	u937	m61	ROADIE	Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
L211201	u931	m61	BOZO	You smell like ass!
L211200	u937	m61	ROADIE	They were all over the place.
L211197	u937	m61	ROADIE	F-f-fuck you.
L211196	u931	m61	BOZO	Welcome back.
L211258	u935	m61	HEROINE	There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
L211257	u931	m61	BOZO	Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
L211205	u935	m61	HEROINE	Get something on that.
L211204	u931	m61	BOZO	Yeah, maybe.
L211013	u931	m61	BOZO	HELLLLLLLLP!!
L211012	u935	m61	HEROINE	COME ON!
L211001	u935	m61	HEROINE	MOVE YOUR ASS!
L211000	u931	m61	BOZO	SHIT.
L210999	u931	m61	BOZO	REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
L210998	u935	m61	HEROINE	Hurry!
L210995	u935	m61	HEROINE	If he doesn't shut up...

L210978	u931	m61	BOZO	What?!
L210974	u935	m61	HEROINE	Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
L210973	u931	m61	BOZO	Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
L210972	u935	m61	HEROINE	You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
L210967	u935	m61	HEROINE	We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
L210966	u931	m61	BOZO	What?
L210965	u935	m61	HEROINE	NO, but I will lock you in.
L210964	u931	m61	BOZO	Gimme the keys.

L211304	u936	m61	PARA	Am I too heavy for you?
L211303	u931	m61	BOZO	Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
L211254	u931	m61	BOZO	Amazing you made it this far.
L211253	u936	m61	PARA	I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
L211221	u931	m61	BOZO	BONSAI!
L211220	u936	m61	PARA	HELP MEEE!
L210861	u931	m61	BOZO	I'm sure.
L210860	u936	m61	PARA	You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
L210859	u931	m61	BOZO	You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
L211137	u932	m61	GOLDIE	I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
L211136	u935	m61	HEROINE	Let's move.
L211072	u935	m61	HEROINE	Ok. Let's see what happens.
L211071	u932	m61	GOLDIE	Yeah, I'll go.
L211020	u935	m61	HEROINE	Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
L211019	u932	m61	GOLDIE	Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
L210844	u935	m61	HEROINE	Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
L210843	u932	m61	GOLDIE	Hey!
L210821	u935	m61	HEROINE	As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
L210820	u932	m61	GOLDIE	Well, maybe they migrate?
L211228	u935	m61	HEROINE	They'll tear this place down within the hour.
L211227	u933	m61	GOOD GUY	Let's wait it out.
L211149	u935	m61	HEROINE	YOU'LL HIT US!
L211148	u933	m61	GOOD GUY	DON'T!
L211102	u933	m61	GOOD GUY	She's not very nice, is she?
L211101	u935	m61	HEROINE	Let's go.
L211088	u935	m61	HEROINE	Nothing, just lookin'.
L211087	u933	m61	GOOD GUY	What's wrong?
L210803	u935	m61	HEROINE	Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
L210802	u933	m61	GOOD GUY	Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
L211340	u937	m61	ROADIE	GO-GO-GO!!
L211339	u935	m61	HEROINE	Get to your cars!
L211324	u935	m61	HEROINE	Go!!!
L211323	u937	m61	ROADIE	Not without you!!!
L211322	u935	m61	HEROINE	Go! Go!
L211237	u935	m61	HEROINE	Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
L211236	u937	m61	ROADIE	If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
L211154	u935	m61	HEROINE	Wait God-dammit!
L211153	u937	m61	ROADIE	Let's go!
L211118	u937	m61	ROADIE	Whoa!
L211117	u935	m61	HEROINE	Hold it!
L210869	u935	m61	HEROINE	That's fine.
L210868	u937	m61	ROADIE	There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
L210807	u937	m61	ROADIE	So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
L210806	u935	m61	HEROINE	Okay, well that's something.
L210672	u935	m61	HEROINE	Father. The biggest, the strongest...
L210671	u937	m61	ROADIE	And the last one is the...
L210670	u935	m61	HEROINE	If you are face to face with her, dive left.
L211374	u935	m61	HEROINE	I think --
L211373	u941	m61	TUFFY	Did we make it?
L211307	u941	m61	TUFFY	I'd love to.
L211306	u935	m61	HEROINE	We should stick together out there.
L210925	u941	m61	TUFFY	Deal.
L210924	u935	m61	HEROINE	I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
L210923	u941	m61	TUFFY	I'll do anything to help.
L210922	u935	m61	HEROINE	She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
L210921	u941	m61	TUFFY	Oh...
L210920	u935	m61	HEROINE	Her name is Charlie.
L210919	u935	m61	HEROINE	Right.
L210918	u941	m61	TUFFY	We all have to be strong, right?
L210917	u935	m61	HEROINE	I admire your strength.
L210916	u941	m61	TUFFY	I'm fine, I really am.
L210915	u935	m61	HEROINE	You know you don't have to do this.
L210849	u935	m61	HEROINE	All right.
L210848	u941	m61	TUFFY	Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
L210684	u935	m61	HEROINE	Let's lock off this room.
L210683	u941	m61	TUFFY	Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
L210679	u935	m61	HEROINE	Stop her!
L210678	u941	m61	TUFFY	Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
L210661	u935	m61	HEROINE	That's one piece of four problems.
L210660	u941	m61	TUFFY	Oh my God... What is that?
L210530	u938	m61	SICKLY BROWNIE	I just hit it like you said.
L210529	u940	m61	TROOP LEADER	What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
L210524	u938	m61	SICKLY BROWNIE	I said I'm not lying.
L210523	u940	m61	TROOP LEADER	You know that no one likes a liar, right?
L210522	u938	m61	SICKLY BROWNIE	I'm not lying.
L210521	u940	m61	TROOP LEADER	What did we say about lying?
L210520	u938	m61	SICKLY BROWNIE	Well...
L210519	u940	m61	TROOP LEADER	Are you lying to me?
L210518	u938	m61	SICKLY BROWNIE	Um, well...
L210517	u940	m61	TROOP LEADER	Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
L210516	u938	m61	SICKLY BROWNIE	Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
L210515	u940	m61	TROOP LEADER	Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
L222770	u971	m63	CREATURE	Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
L222769	u982	m63	WALTON	What kindness?
L222768	u971	m63	CREATURE	I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
L222766	u971	m63	CREATURE	Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
L222765	u982	m63	WALTON	Then why weep for him?
L222764	u971	m63	CREATURE	And he drove me to mine.
L222763	u982	m63	WALTON	You drove him to his torment.
L222762	u971	m63	CREATURE	I am as he made me. In his own image.
L222761	u982	m63	WALTON	What is that to you? Evil as you are.
L222760	u971	m63	CREATURE	I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
L222759	u971	m63	CREATURE	I was watching.
L222758	u982	m63	WALTON	Yes.
L222757	u971	m63	CREATURE	You were with him at the end.
L222502	u971	m63	CREATURE	I am afraid.
L222501	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	People can be kinder than you think.
L222500	u971	m63	CREATURE	I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
L222499	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	Why do you not go to them?
L222498	u971	m63	CREATURE	Yes. Very close
L222497	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	Friends? Do they live around here?
L222496	u971	m63	CREATURE	Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
L222495	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	You're an outcast.
L222493	u971	m63	CREATURE	Worse.
L222492	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	It can't be as bad as that.
L222491	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
L222490	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	Why?
L222489	u971	m63	CREATURE	Better that way... for me.
L222488	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
L222487	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	The music? Or the fire?
L222486	u971	m63	CREATURE	Nice.
L222739	u980	m63	VICTOR	SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
L222738	u971	m63	CREATURE	GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
L222734	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
L222733	u980	m63	VICTOR	She's not for you.
L222732	u971	m63	CREATURE	She's beautiful.
L222677	u971	m63	CREATURE	That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
L222676	u980	m63	VICTOR	I will not! Kill me now!
L222675	u971	m63	CREATURE	You will honor your promise to me!
L222674	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. I draw the line.
L222673	u971	m63	CREATURE	What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
L222672	u980	m63	VICTOR	This was not taken from a grave.
L222671	u971	m63	CREATURE	A brain. Extremities.
L222670	u980	m63	VICTOR	What is this?
L222664	u971	m63	CREATURE	Her body pleases me.
L222663	u980	m63	VICTOR	Why... her?
L222642	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'll be waiting. And watching.
L222641	u980	m63	VICTOR	Yes. I want this over and done with.
L222640	u971	m63	CREATURE	Soon?
L222639	u971	m63	CREATURE	We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
L222638	u980	m63	VICTOR	And if I consent?
L222637	u971	m63	CREATURE	I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
L222636	u980	m63	VICTOR	Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
L222635	u971	m63	CREATURE	A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
L222634	u980	m63	VICTOR	Friend?
L222633	u971	m63	CREATURE	There is something I want.  A friend.
L222632	u980	m63	VICTOR	What can I do?
L222631	u971	m63	CREATURE	Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
L222630	u980	m63	VICTOR	I don't know.
L222629	u971	m63	CREATURE	Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
L222628	u980	m63	VICTOR	Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
L222627	u971	m63	CREATURE	In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
L222626	u971	m63	CREATURE	You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
L222625	u980	m63	VICTOR	Materials. Nothing more.
L222624	u971	m63	CREATURE	What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
L222623	u980	m63	VICTOR	There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
L222622	u971	m63	CREATURE	Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
L222615	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
L222614	u980	m63	VICTOR	I see it before me.
L222613	u971	m63	CREATURE	Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
L222612	u980	m63	VICTOR	How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
L222611	u971	m63	CREATURE	Your crime... as well as mine.
L222610	u980	m63	VICTOR	Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
L222609	u971	m63	CREATURE	More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
L222608	u980	m63	VICTOR	Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
L222607	u971	m63	CREATURE	Kill you? Hardly that.
L222606	u980	m63	VICTOR	Kill me and have done with it.
L222605	u971	m63	CREATURE	The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
L222604	u980	m63	VICTOR	How did you find me?
L222603	u971	m63	CREATURE	Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
L222602	u980	m63	VICTOR	You speak.
L222601	u971	m63	CREATURE	Come warm yourself if you like.
L222540	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Fine.
L222539	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Are you all right?
L222388	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
L222387	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
L222386	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
L222385	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I should go. I should leave today.
L222384	u977	m63	JUSTINE	So have I
L222383	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
L222382	u977	m63	JUSTINE	It's been months. It's not like him.
L222381	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Nothing. Still nothing.
L222311	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	"He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a ""pompous...  Fellow..."""
L222310	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Must've been a terrible row.
L222186	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	And you look so lovely.
L222185	u977	m63	JUSTINE	You dance so beautifully together.
L222182	u977	m63	JUSTINE	One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
L222181	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
L222180	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
L222176	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Quite right!
L222175	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
L222170	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	There, there... shhh...
L222169	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Poor William! What indignant tears!
L222545	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	It's far too late for him to still be out.
L222544	u973	m63	FATHER	Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
L222543	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Is he not back yet?
L222542	u973	m63	FATHER	Have you seen Willie?
L222527	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
L222526	u973	m63	FATHER	What does it say?
L222313	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
L222312	u973	m63	FATHER	He always was opinionated.
L222713	u980	m63	VICTOR	Open this door for no-one!
L222712	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor!
L222711	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I have been waiting for this ever since.
L222710	u980	m63	VICTOR	I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
L222709	u980	m63	VICTOR	Now husband and wife.
L222708	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Brother and sister no more.
L222686	u980	m63	VICTOR	I do. But you must trust me for now.
L222685	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
L222684	u980	m63	VICTOR	Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
L222683	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
L222682	u980	m63	VICTOR	We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
L222681	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	It is
L222680	u980	m63	VICTOR	It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
L222679	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Why the change? What about your work?
L222678	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
L222655	u980	m63	VICTOR	A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
L222654	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
L222653	u980	m63	VICTOR	So do I.
L222652	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
L222651	u980	m63	VICTOR	It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
L222650	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	What sort of task?
L222644	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'm all right. I'm safe,
L222643	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I thought I'd never see you again!
L222599	u980	m63	VICTOR	I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
L222598	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
L222597	u980	m63	VICTOR	They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
L222596	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
L222595	u980	m63	VICTOR	I've no choice
L222594	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
L222593	u980	m63	VICTOR	My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
L222223	u980	m63	VICTOR	Elizabeth. My more than sister.
L222222	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor. I love you,
L222221	u980	m63	VICTOR	...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
L222220	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I give you my soul...
L222219	u980	m63	VICTOR	Your decision. For us.
L222218	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Our decision. Together.
L222217	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Not as weak as I.
L222216	u980	m63	VICTOR	You make me weak.
L222213	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I will be here when you return.
L222212	u980	m63	VICTOR	Only you.
L222211	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
L222210	u980	m63	VICTOR	Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
L222209	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I wish to be your wife.
L222208	u980	m63	VICTOR	I wish to be your husband.
L222207	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Brother and sister still?
L222206	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Is that what makes it so delicious?
L222205	u980	m63	VICTOR	This feels... incestuous.
L222204	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	All my life I've known.
L222203	u980	m63	VICTOR	I've loved you all my life
L222200	u980	m63	VICTOR	To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
L222199	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	You will.  What do you want, Victor?
L222198	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'll have to do better than that.
L222197	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
L222196	u980	m63	VICTOR	And you?
L222195	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Father's so proud.
L222194	u980	m63	VICTOR	Quite a send-off, isn't it?
L222193	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Smell the air. Wonderful.
L222178	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
L222177	u980	m63	VICTOR	Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
L222174	u980	m63	VICTOR	He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
L222173	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
L222172	u980	m63	VICTOR	The world is a dizzying place.
L222171	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
L222167	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
L222166	u980	m63	VICTOR	God took her from us.
L222165	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
L222164	u980	m63	VICTOR	What kind of God is He to will this?
L222163	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
L222162	u980	m63	VICTOR	How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
L222145	u980	m63	VICTOR	Nothing can. Not ever.
L222144	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Are you sure it can't hurt us?
L222142	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Aren't you?
L222141	u980	m63	VICTOR	Don't cry, Elizabeth.
L222754	u975	m63	GRIGORI	Aye, Captain.
L222753	u982	m63	WALTON	He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
L222752	u975	m63	GRIGORI	This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
L222751	u982	m63	WALTON	A warming wind.
L222109	u975	m63	GRIGORI	Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
L222108	u982	m63	WALTON	They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
L222107	u975	m63	GRIGORI	Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
L222085	u982	m63	WALTON	It wouldn't dare.
L222084	u975	m63	GRIGORI	It's going to ram us.
L222354	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Oh God.
L222353	u976	m63	HENRY	Professor?
L222337	u976	m63	HENRY	Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
L222336	u981	m63	WALDMAN	No. But someday.
L222335	u976	m63	HENRY	Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
L222334	u981	m63	WALDMAN	I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
L222333	u976	m63	HENRY	You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
L222332	u981	m63	WALDMAN	I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
L222745	u976	m63	HENRY	Let it go.
L222744	u980	m63	VICTOR	All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
L222697	u980	m63	VICTOR	I owe you that. Done.
L222696	u976	m63	HENRY	Only if you'll tell me who he is.
L222695	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
L222694	u976	m63	HENRY	Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
L222693	u980	m63	VICTOR	Are you sure you'll be all right?
L222646	u980	m63	VICTOR	I didn't find what I was looking for.
L222645	u976	m63	HENRY	What happened up there?
L222553	u980	m63	VICTOR	This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
L222552	u976	m63	HENRY	For what?
L222551	u980	m63	VICTOR	Thank you, Henry.
L222550	u976	m63	HENRY	Quite a place.
L222435	u976	m63	HENRY	Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
L222434	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. They don't.
L222433	u976	m63	HENRY	It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
L222432	u976	m63	HENRY	Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222431	u980	m63	VICTOR	Everything in moderation, Clerval.
L222430	u976	m63	HENRY	We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
L222429	u980	m63	VICTOR	You've been going round-the-clock?
L222428	u976	m63	HENRY	Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
L222427	u980	m63	VICTOR	Is that your diagnosis?
L222426	u976	m63	HENRY	We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
L222425	u980	m63	VICTOR	A... week?
L222424	u976	m63	HENRY	Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
L222401	u980	m63	VICTOR	You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
L222400	u976	m63	HENRY	Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
L222399	u980	m63	VICTOR	Yes? And?
L222398	u976	m63	HENRY	Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
L222397	u980	m63	VICTOR	This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
L222379	u980	m63	VICTOR	Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
L222378	u976	m63	HENRY	How much longer?
L222377	u980	m63	VICTOR	That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
L222376	u976	m63	HENRY	We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
L222375	u980	m63	VICTOR	I've been preoccupied.
L222374	u976	m63	HENRY	Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
L222369	u976	m63	HENRY	There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
L222368	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. He had more important work.
L222367	u976	m63	HENRY	All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
L222366	u980	m63	VICTOR	Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
L222365	u976	m63	HENRY	That's blasphemy!
L222364	u980	m63	VICTOR	I resent God's monopoly.
L222363	u976	m63	HENRY	You can't. Death is God's will!
L222362	u980	m63	VICTOR	Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
L222361	u976	m63	HENRY	You're making a scene!
L222360	u980	m63	VICTOR	It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
L222359	u976	m63	HENRY	Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
L222358	u980	m63	VICTOR	Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
L222357	u976	m63	HENRY	They'll hang him all the same.
L222356	u980	m63	VICTOR	He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
L222355	u976	m63	HENRY	They just caught the man who did it.
L222343	u980	m63	VICTOR	Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
L222342	u976	m63	HENRY	And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222339	u976	m63	HENRY	Somebody has to!
L222338	u980	m63	VICTOR	Only you would think of that!
L222289	u980	m63	VICTOR	But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
L222288	u976	m63	HENRY	...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
L222287	u980	m63	VICTOR	These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
L222286	u976	m63	HENRY	Now you've got him started.
L222278	u980	m63	VICTOR	It's a letter to my father.
L222277	u976	m63	HENRY	What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
L222276	u980	m63	VICTOR	You're a comfort to me, Henry.
L222275	u976	m63	HENRY	The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
L222263	u976	m63	HENRY	Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
L222262	u980	m63	VICTOR	Quite a few.
L222261	u976	m63	HENRY	Can you think of a better reason?
L222260	u980	m63	VICTOR	Rich old ladies and their daughters?
L222253	u976	m63	HENRY	Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
L222252	u980	m63	VICTOR	Do you really think I'm mad?
L222251	u976	m63	HENRY	I know. You have a way of making an impression.
L222250	u980	m63	VICTOR	Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
L222249	u976	m63	HENRY	Henry Clerval.
L222248	u976	m63	HENRY	Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
L222247	u980	m63	VICTOR	Are you having me on?
L222246	u976	m63	HENRY	As a march hare.
L222245	u980	m63	VICTOR	I am not mad.
L222243	u980	m63	VICTOR	Very well then.
L222242	u976	m63	HENRY	I was just clearing my throat.
L222589	u977	m63	JUSTINE	I have no knowledge of that.
L222588	u979	m63	PROSECUTOR	So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
L222587	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
L222586	u979	m63	PROSECUTOR	Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
L222585	u977	m63	JUSTINE	I have always loved him.
L222584	u979	m63	PROSECUTOR	And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
L222583	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
L222324	u980	m63	VICTOR	Despite the lack of challenge.
L222323	u978	m63	KREMPE	You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
L222239	u978	m63	KREMPE	Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
L222238	u980	m63	VICTOR	Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
L222237	u978	m63	KREMPE	What is your name?
L222236	u980	m63	VICTOR	Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
L222235	u978	m63	KREMPE	Paracelsus?
L222234	u980	m63	VICTOR	Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
L222233	u978	m63	KREMPE	Philosophical?
L222232	u980	m63	VICTOR	But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
L222231	u978	m63	KREMPE	In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
L222341	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
L222340	u980	m63	VICTOR	I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
L222326	u980	m63	VICTOR	The strain was evident.
L222325	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
L222320	u980	m63	VICTOR	Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
L222319	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Re-configure the leads?
L222306	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
L222305	u980	m63	VICTOR	Why?
L222304	u981	m63	WALDMAN	"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
L222303	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
L222302	u980	m63	VICTOR	I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
L222301	u981	m63	WALDMAN	It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
L222300	u980	m63	VICTOR	But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
L222299	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
L222298	u980	m63	VICTOR	It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
L222297	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Electricity.
L222294	u981	m63	WALDMAN	I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
L222293	u980	m63	VICTOR	Preposterous.
L222285	u980	m63	VICTOR	No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
L222284	u981	m63	WALDMAN	You disdain accepted wisdom?
L222283	u980	m63	VICTOR	To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
L222282	u981	m63	WALDMAN	You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
L222281	u980	m63	VICTOR	Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
L222280	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Victor, explain yourself.
L222279	u980	m63	VICTOR	Professor Waldman.
L222131	u980	m63	VICTOR	My name is Frankenstein...
L222130	u982	m63	WALTON	Who are you?
L222129	u980	m63	VICTOR	We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
L222128	u982	m63	WALTON	Madness?
L222127	u980	m63	VICTOR	Do you share my madness?
L222126	u982	m63	WALTON	Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
L222125	u980	m63	VICTOR	You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
L222124	u982	m63	WALTON	Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
L222123	u980	m63	VICTOR	Your men are right to be afraid.
L222122	u982	m63	WALTON	You know of it?
L222121	u980	m63	VICTOR	Creature? A... human like creature?
L222120	u982	m63	WALTON	I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
L222119	u980	m63	VICTOR	I heard.
L222118	u982	m63	WALTON	Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
L222117	u980	m63	VICTOR	Ah. An explorer.
L222116	u982	m63	WALTON	There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
L222115	u980	m63	VICTOR	How is it you come to be here?
L222114	u982	m63	WALTON	Are you a physician?
L222113	u980	m63	VICTOR	Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
L222112	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'm... dying.
L222111	u982	m63	WALTON	You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
L225234	u983	m64	ALICE	Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
L225233	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	We should go now.
L225229	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	I will protect you.
L225228	u983	m64	ALICE	The killer is still out there.
L225226	u983	m64	ALICE	Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
L225225	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
L225219	u983	m64	ALICE	No, no, they're all dead...
L225218	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
L225217	u983	m64	ALICE	Jack? Marcie? Ned?
L225216	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
L225215	u983	m64	ALICE	He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
L225146	u983	m64	ALICE	Good night, Brenda.
L225145	u986	m64	BRENDA	Good night, Alice.
L225143	u983	m64	ALICE	I guess...
L225142	u986	m64	BRENDA	Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
L225141	u983	m64	ALICE	I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
L225043	u983	m64	ALICE	I was careless.
L225042	u986	m64	BRENDA	Melvin Belli.
L225034	u986	m64	BRENDA	Right! Right!
L225033	u983	m64	ALICE	Tomorrow is another day.
L225032	u986	m64	BRENDA	Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
L224949	u986	m64	BRENDA	I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
L224948	u983	m64	ALICE	What'd you see?
L224906	u983	m64	ALICE	Sure.
L224905	u993	m64	STEVE	I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
L224904	u993	m64	STEVE	Thanks, Alice.
L224903	u983	m64	ALICE	Next Friday.
L224902	u993	m64	STEVE	You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
L224901	u983	m64	ALICE	I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
L224900	u993	m64	STEVE	You want to leave?
L224899	u983	m64	ALICE	Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
L224898	u993	m64	STEVE	Any particular reason?
L224896	u983	m64	ALICE	Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
L224895	u993	m64	STEVE	You draw very well.
L224873	u983	m64	ALICE	You told her to sweep the courts.
L224872	u993	m64	STEVE	That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
L224871	u993	m64	STEVE	Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
L224870	u983	m64	ALICE	Cabin B is ready.
L225202	u985	m64	BILL	It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
L225201	u983	m64	ALICE	Why don't we run? Just run now?
L225200	u985	m64	BILL	Wet. I don't know.
L225199	u983	m64	ALICE	What's the matter with it?
L225197	u985	m64	BILL	No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
L225196	u983	m64	ALICE	Do you have a dime? A quarter?
L225195	u985	m64	BILL	It's dead. Try the pay phone.
L225190	u985	m64	BILL	Hey, guys!
L225189	u983	m64	ALICE	Marcie?
L225188	u985	m64	BILL	Jack?
L225167	u983	m64	ALICE	Okay.
L225166	u985	m64	BILL	I'll go check on Brenda.
L225165	u983	m64	ALICE	They're off now.
L225164	u985	m64	BILL	Where?
L225163	u983	m64	ALICE	Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
L225162	u985	m64	BILL	I'll go take a look.
L225161	u983	m64	ALICE	It sounded like Brenda.
L225160	u985	m64	BILL	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
L225159	u983	m64	ALICE	I don't hear it anymore.
L225148	u983	m64	ALICE	Absolutely.
L225147	u985	m64	BILL	Help you clean up?
L225139	u983	m64	ALICE	Well, it hasn't been that long.
L225138	u985	m64	BILL	Good point.
L225137	u983	m64	ALICE	It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
L225102	u985	m64	BILL	Not if they're where I think they are.
L225101	u983	m64	ALICE	Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
L225007	u983	m64	ALICE	Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
L225006	u985	m64	BILL	Trouble?
L224974	u985	m64	BILL	Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
L224973	u983	m64	ALICE	How the... did he get in there?
L224965	u983	m64	ALICE	And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
L224964	u985	m64	BILL	You can only do what you can do.
L224962	u985	m64	BILL	Almost five.
L224961	u983	m64	ALICE	I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
L224953	u983	m64	ALICE	I don't know.
L224952	u985	m64	BILL	What'll you do when you leave here?
L224951	u983	m64	ALICE	I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
L224950	u985	m64	BILL	It still hurts?
L224942	u983	m64	ALICE	Artist.
L224941	u985	m64	BILL	Filmmaker.
L224932	u985	m64	BILL	You're right. It makes no sense.
L224931	u983	m64	ALICE	And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
L224930	u985	m64	BILL	Maybe I can help?
L224929	u983	m64	ALICE	It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
L224928	u985	m64	BILL	How come you're leaving?
L224926	u985	m64	BILL	You okay?
L224925	u983	m64	ALICE	Oh, my God...
L224924	u983	m64	ALICE	Un-hunh.
L224923	u985	m64	BILL	Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
L224883	u983	m64	ALICE	I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
L224882	u985	m64	BILL	You think you're gonna last all summer?
L224881	u983	m64	ALICE	Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
L224880	u985	m64	BILL	Alice? The others show up?
L224878	u985	m64	BILL	I finished the boats.
L224877	u983	m64	ALICE	Steve said for you to start on the boats.
L225068	u983	m64	ALICE	You're welcome.
L225067	u991	m64	NED	I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
L225066	u983	m64	ALICE	Sure.
L225064	u983	m64	ALICE	Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
L225063	u991	m64	NED	I'm sorry.
L224957	u991	m64	NED	Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
L224956	u983	m64	ALICE	I'll be along.
L224911	u991	m64	NED	Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
L224910	u983	m64	ALICE	How come?
L224813	u984	m64	BARRY	I need you so much, Claudette.
L224812	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Let's go back, Barry...
L224811	u984	m64	BARRY	Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
L224810	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Somebody's there, Barry.
L224809	u984	m64	BARRY	No, they won't...
L224808	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Somebody'll see.
L224807	u984	m64	BARRY	Claudette...
L224806	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Oh, you...
L224805	u984	m64	BARRY	I wouldn't know.
L224802	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	I can't, Barry...
L224801	u984	m64	BARRY	You know what I said, though.
L224800	u984	m64	BARRY	I meant everything.
L224799	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	You said we were special.
L225072	u985	m64	BILL	Where's Ned?
L225071	u988	m64	JACK	You just had some lucky shots.
L225061	u988	m64	JACK	I'll spot you five points.
L225060	u985	m64	BILL	Chance to get even?
L225055	u988	m64	JACK	Get behind him more.
L225054	u985	m64	BILL	Roll him over!
L225051	u985	m64	BILL	Is it stuck?
L225050	u988	m64	JACK	What is it?
L225024	u985	m64	BILL	A short somewhere.
L225023	u988	m64	JACK	Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
L225020	u985	m64	BILL	I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
L225019	u988	m64	JACK	Thanks.
L225018	u985	m64	BILL	I had to.
L225017	u988	m64	JACK	You saved my life.
L225016	u985	m64	BILL	Don't get up. Take a second...
L225015	u988	m64	JACK	I'll be okay. Holy shit...
L225013	u988	m64	JACK	Here we go.
L225012	u985	m64	BILL	This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
L225011	u985	m64	BILL	For sure.
L225010	u988	m64	JACK	Give me a hand?
L224990	u985	m64	BILL	Where'd you get that stuff?
L224989	u988	m64	JACK	What the hell?
L225029	u991	m64	NED	Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."" ""What hath God wrought"" was the telegraph."
L225028	u986	m64	BRENDA	That was the telephone.
L225027	u991	m64	NED	What hath God wrought?
L224998	u986	m64	BRENDA	Whatever you make yourself.
L224997	u991	m64	NED	No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
L224960	u986	m64	BRENDA	We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
L224959	u991	m64	NED	Holy shit...
L224935	u986	m64	BRENDA	Dancer.
L224934	u991	m64	NED	What do you want to be when you grow up?
L224920	u991	m64	NED	God, but I love that sexy talk.
L224919	u986	m64	BRENDA	You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
L224918	u991	m64	NED	Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
L224917	u986	m64	BRENDA	I don't believe you...
L224916	u991	m64	NED	Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
L225009	u991	m64	NED	God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
L225008	u988	m64	JACK	Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
L224994	u991	m64	NED	Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
L224993	u988	m64	JACK	It's gonna be a long summer.
L224940	u988	m64	JACK	Coach, athletic director somewhere.
L224939	u991	m64	NED	Jack?
L224863	u988	m64	JACK	Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
L224862	u991	m64	NED	What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
L224858	u991	m64	NED	I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
L224857	u988	m64	JACK	Ow!
L224856	u991	m64	NED	Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
L224855	u988	m64	JACK	Ha!
L225110	u989	m64	MARCIE	Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
L225109	u988	m64	JACK	Whassamatta?
L225108	u989	m64	MARCIE	Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
L225107	u988	m64	JACK	Umhummmmph.
L225106	u989	m64	MARCIE	Best over...
L225105	u988	m64	JACK	Mmmmmmmph.
L225104	u989	m64	MARCIE	Mmmmmmmph?
L225100	u988	m64	JACK	Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
L225099	u989	m64	MARCIE	Are you wet?
L225098	u989	m64	MARCIE	Lead the way!
L225097	u988	m64	JACK	This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
L225096	u989	m64	MARCIE	I call it my shower dream.
L225095	u988	m64	JACK	It's just a dream.
L225093	u988	m64	JACK	You? The brick?
L225092	u989	m64	MARCIE	I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
L225091	u988	m64	JACK	Looks like a storm.
L225090	u989	m64	MARCIE	I guess...
L225089	u988	m64	JACK	I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
L225088	u989	m64	MARCIE	Don't call him.
L225087	u988	m64	JACK	Ned!
L225086	u989	m64	MARCIE	He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
L225085	u988	m64	JACK	I don't love Neddy.
L225084	u989	m64	MARCIE	What about Neddy?
L225083	u989	m64	MARCIE	I love you.
L225082	u988	m64	JACK	I love you.
L225081	u989	m64	MARCIE	Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
L225080	u988	m64	JACK	Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
L225079	u989	m64	MARCIE	Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
L225078	u988	m64	JACK	Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
L224861	u988	m64	JACK	Good call.
L224860	u989	m64	MARCIE	How about our last jay?
L225059	u991	m64	NED	"But it's in the brochure! ""Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program."" You just saw it."
L225058	u989	m64	MARCIE	Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
L225037	u991	m64	NED	Those things can be nasty.
L225036	u989	m64	MARCIE	You okay?
L225031	u991	m64	NED	Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
L225030	u989	m64	MARCIE	Last line of Gone With the Wind?
L224944	u989	m64	MARCIE	Rocky Road.
L224943	u991	m64	NED	Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
L224938	u989	m64	MARCIE	Okay, Fireman.
L224937	u991	m64	NED	Girls can't be cowboys.
L224936	u989	m64	MARCIE	Cowboy.
L224866	u991	m64	NED	Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
L224865	u989	m64	MARCIE	It's beautiful...
L224854	u991	m64	NED	There you are dead wrong.
L224853	u989	m64	MARCIE	Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
L225132	u993	m64	STEVE	For two lonely nights.
L225131	u992	m64	SANDY	That's thirty percent.
L225130	u993	m64	STEVE	Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
L225128	u992	m64	SANDY	...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
L225127	u993	m64	STEVE	I mean...
L225126	u992	m64	SANDY	One night on the town.
L225125	u993	m64	STEVE	How much do I owe you?
L225124	u992	m64	SANDY	They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
L225123	u993	m64	STEVE	I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
L225122	u992	m64	SANDY	Aw.
L225121	u993	m64	STEVE	I got to.
L225120	u992	m64	SANDY	You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
L225119	u993	m64	STEVE	No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
L225118	u992	m64	SANDY	Anything else you want?
L225184	u993	m64	STEVE	Yeah.
L225183	u994	m64	TIERNEY	Another coincidence.
L225182	u993	m64	STEVE	Good luck.
L225181	u993	m64	STEVE	Sure.
L225180	u994	m64	TIERNEY	Have to drop you here, Steve.
L225171	u993	m64	STEVE	You've made a science out of coincidence.
L225170	u994	m64	TIERNEY	Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
L225151	u994	m64	TIERNEY	Why not?
L225150	u993	m64	STEVE	I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
L225149	u994	m64	TIERNEY	I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
L227821	u995	m65	BORDER GUARD	Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
L227820	u997	m65	JACOB	I meant me, my son and my daughter.
L227819	u995	m65	BORDER GUARD	You said it was just you and your son.
L227818	u997	m65	JACOB	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
L227817	u995	m65	BORDER GUARD	What was that?
L227813	u997	m65	JACOB	Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
L227812	u995	m65	BORDER GUARD	What is your purpose in Mexico?
L227811	u997	m65	JACOB	Just my son and I.
L227810	u995	m65	BORDER GUARD	How many with you?
L228156	u996	m65	CARLOS	Vamanos!
L228155	u1005	m65	SETH	So let's do it.
L228154	u996	m65	CARLOS	Yeah, follow us.
L228153	u1005	m65	SETH	So do I just follow you?
L228152	u996	m65	CARLOS	It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
L228151	u1005	m65	SETH	I said new, this is an '90.
L228150	u996	m65	CARLOS	You like the car?
L228148	u1005	m65	SETH	Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
L228147	u996	m65	CARLOS	Twenty-eight.
L228146	u1005	m65	SETH	You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
L228145	u996	m65	CARLOS	Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
L228144	u1005	m65	SETH	Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
L228143	u996	m65	CARLOS	I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
L228142	u1005	m65	SETH	Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
L228141	u996	m65	CARLOS	No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
L228140	u1005	m65	SETH	Have you ever been there before?
L228139	u996	m65	CARLOS	I don't know, one place's as good as another.
L228138	u1005	m65	SETH	Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
L228137	u996	m65	CARLOS	Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
L228113	u997	m65	JACOB	To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
L228112	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Why did they block the door again?
L228109	u997	m65	JACOB	Thank you, son.
L228108	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
L228107	u997	m65	JACOB	It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
L228106	u1004	m65	SCOTT	You don't believe in suicide.
L227809	u997	m65	JACOB	"I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to ""go for it."" I need your cover. Cover my ass."
L227808	u1004	m65	SCOTT	He's running the show.
L227807	u997	m65	JACOB	Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
L227806	u1004	m65	SCOTT	If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
L227805	u997	m65	JACOB	Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
L227804	u1004	m65	SCOTT	They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
L227803	u997	m65	JACOB	What about Kate?
L227802	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
L227801	u997	m65	JACOB	If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
L227800	u1004	m65	SCOTT	They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
L227799	u997	m65	JACOB	Have you forgotten about your sister?
L227781	u1004	m65	SCOTT	No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
L227780	u997	m65	JACOB	I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
L227779	u1004	m65	SCOTT	What are you gonna do?
L227646	u997	m65	JACOB	I have no idea.
L227645	u1004	m65	SCOTT	What's this guy's problem?
L227508	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
L227507	u997	m65	JACOB	I'm exhausted.
L227506	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Why do you want to stop?
L227502	u1004	m65	SCOTT	The truth hurts.
L227501	u997	m65	JACOB	Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
L227492	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
L227491	u997	m65	JACOB	We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
L228096	u997	m65	JACOB	Kate, Scott?
L228095	u1005	m65	SETH	I promise.
L228093	u997	m65	JACOB	Amen.
L228092	u1005	m65	SETH	I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
L228091	u997	m65	JACOB	Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
L228090	u1005	m65	SETH	My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
L228089	u997	m65	JACOB	What's this stuff?
L228085	u997	m65	JACOB	You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
L228084	u1005	m65	SETH	You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
L228082	u997	m65	JACOB	Yep.
L228081	u1005	m65	SETH	Did he...?
L228029	u1005	m65	SETH	Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
L228028	u997	m65	JACOB	What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
L228027	u1005	m65	SETH	I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
L228024	u1005	m65	SETH	In other words, no.
L228023	u997	m65	JACOB	In the Winnebago.
L228022	u1005	m65	SETH	Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
L228021	u997	m65	JACOB	I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
L228020	u1005	m65	SETH	You too, preacher?
L228019	u1005	m65	SETH	"Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about ""I don't believe in vampires"" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires."
L228018	u997	m65	JACOB	Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
L227947	u1005	m65	SETH	Forever together.
L227946	u997	m65	JACOB	Now, is your shit together?
L227945	u997	m65	JACOB	To yours.
L227944	u1005	m65	SETH	To your family.
L227942	u997	m65	JACOB	Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
L227941	u1005	m65	SETH	What did you call me?
L227940	u997	m65	JACOB	Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
L227939	u1005	m65	SETH	I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
L227938	u997	m65	JACOB	Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
L227937	u1005	m65	SETH	I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
L227936	u997	m65	JACOB	What are you going to do?
L227935	u1005	m65	SETH	"He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', ""Fuck you Jack."" I hear that loud and clear."
L227934	u997	m65	JACOB	He backed down.
L227933	u1005	m65	SETH	I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
L227932	u997	m65	JACOB	Why are you so agitated?
L227924	u1005	m65	SETH	Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
L227923	u997	m65	JACOB	No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
L227922	u1005	m65	SETH	Why not, against your religion?
L227921	u997	m65	JACOB	Pass.
L227920	u1005	m65	SETH	Who else?
L227868	u1005	m65	SETH	Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
L227867	u997	m65	JACOB	Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
L227839	u1005	m65	SETH	Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
L227838	u997	m65	JACOB	Then?
L227835	u1005	m65	SETH	Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
L227834	u997	m65	JACOB	We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
L227778	u1005	m65	SETH	Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
L227777	u997	m65	JACOB	I don't have the slightest idea.
L227776	u1005	m65	SETH	As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
L227775	u997	m65	JACOB	I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
L227760	u1005	m65	SETH	You best better get it done, Pops.
L227759	u997	m65	JACOB	I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
L227758	u1005	m65	SETH	Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
L227752	u1005	m65	SETH	Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
L227751	u997	m65	JACOB	If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
L227748	u1005	m65	SETH	I can handle Richie, don't worry.
L227747	u997	m65	JACOB	You won't let him touch her?
L227746	u1005	m65	SETH	Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
L227745	u997	m65	JACOB	No, I didn't.
L227744	u1005	m65	SETH	Didn't like it, did ya?
L227743	u997	m65	JACOB	Yes.
L227742	u1005	m65	SETH	Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
L227741	u997	m65	JACOB	You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
L227740	u1005	m65	SETH	Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
L227739	u997	m65	JACOB	How do I know you'll keep your word?
L227738	u1005	m65	SETH	I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
L227737	u997	m65	JACOB	Yes.
L227736	u1005	m65	SETH	I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
L227735	u997	m65	JACOB	I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
L227734	u1005	m65	SETH	Why'd ya quit?
L227733	u997	m65	JACOB	Yes.
L227732	u1005	m65	SETH	Was? As in not anymore?
L227731	u997	m65	JACOB	I was a minister.
L227730	u1005	m65	SETH	You're a preacher?
L227729	u997	m65	JACOB	Real McCoy.
L227728	u1005	m65	SETH	I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
L227727	u997	m65	JACOB	Yes.
L227726	u1005	m65	SETH	Is this real?
L227725	u997	m65	JACOB	Yes, they do.
L227724	u1005	m65	SETH	Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
L227723	u997	m65	JACOB	Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
L227722	u1005	m65	SETH	Died instantly?
L227721	u997	m65	JACOB	No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
L227720	u1005	m65	SETH	Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
L227719	u997	m65	JACOB	Auto wreck.
L227718	u1005	m65	SETH	How'd she die?
L227717	u997	m65	JACOB	Yes, she is.
L227716	u1005	m65	SETH	She's dead?
L227715	u997	m65	JACOB	In heaven.
L227714	u1005	m65	SETH	Where is the little lady?
L227713	u997	m65	JACOB	My wife.
L227712	u1005	m65	SETH	Who's this?
L227710	u997	m65	JACOB	Scott and Kate.
L227709	u1005	m65	SETH	Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
L227700	u1005	m65	SETH	Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
L227699	u997	m65	JACOB	Yes.
L227697	u1005	m65	SETH	That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
L227696	u997	m65	JACOB	My children are not going with you, and that's that.
L227695	u1005	m65	SETH	Sorry, I need everybody.
L227694	u997	m65	JACOB	If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
L227693	u1005	m65	SETH	Come again?
L227692	u997	m65	JACOB	Not a chance.
L227678	u1005	m65	SETH	Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
L227677	u997	m65	JACOB	On the dresser.
L227676	u1005	m65	SETH	Where are the keys to the motor home?
L227675	u1005	m65	SETH	Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
L227674	u997	m65	JACOB	It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
L227670	u1005	m65	SETH	It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
L227669	u997	m65	JACOB	What's this about, money?
L227668	u1005	m65	SETH	Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
L227667	u997	m65	JACOB	Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
L227666	u1005	m65	SETH	How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
L227665	u997	m65	JACOB	He's my son.
L227664	u1005	m65	SETH	What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
L227661	u1005	m65	SETH	Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
L227660	u997	m65	JACOB	Jacob.
L227659	u1005	m65	SETH	What's your name?
L228118	u998	m65	KATE	Everybody goes home!
L228117	u997	m65	JACOB	No!
L228116	u998	m65	KATE	I'm going for 'em!
L228105	u997	m65	JACOB	Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
L228104	u998	m65	KATE	I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
L228103	u997	m65	JACOB	Not good enough, swear to God.
L228102	u998	m65	KATE	Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
L228101	u997	m65	JACOB	Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
L228098	u997	m65	JACOB	Scott?
L228097	u998	m65	KATE	I promise.
L228087	u997	m65	JACOB	No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
L228086	u998	m65	KATE	You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
L228039	u998	m65	KATE	So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
L228038	u997	m65	JACOB	About two hours from now.
L227642	u998	m65	KATE	Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
L227641	u997	m65	JACOB	It has a bed. That's all I care about.
L227640	u998	m65	KATE	If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
L227639	u997	m65	JACOB	It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
L227638	u998	m65	KATE	It's a flop house.
L227637	u997	m65	JACOB	There's nothing wrong with this place.
L227521	u997	m65	JACOB	Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
L227520	u998	m65	KATE	What do you think Mom would say?
L227519	u997	m65	JACOB	Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
L227518	u998	m65	KATE	That happens, you'll get it back.
L227517	u997	m65	JACOB	I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
L227516	u998	m65	KATE	It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
L227515	u997	m65	JACOB	Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
L227514	u998	m65	KATE	I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
L227513	u997	m65	JACOB	That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
L227512	u998	m65	KATE	Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
L227510	u998	m65	KATE	Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
L227509	u997	m65	JACOB	I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
L227505	u998	m65	KATE	Ain't it the truth.
L227504	u997	m65	JACOB	You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
L227503	u998	m65	KATE	It's the bitterest of pills.
L227768	u1003	m65	RICHARD	You asked me if I would --
L227767	u998	m65	KATE	What did I say?
L227766	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What you said to me in the room.
L227765	u998	m65	KATE	Do what?
L227764	u1003	m65	RICHARD	In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
L227763	u998	m65	KATE	What?
L227708	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Mexicans.
L227707	u998	m65	KATE	What's in Mexico?
L227706	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Mexico.
L227705	u998	m65	KATE	Where are you taking us?
L227704	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What?
L227680	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Sure.
L227679	u998	m65	KATE	Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
L227673	u1003	m65	RICHARD	We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
L227672	u998	m65	KATE	What's going on?
L228160	u998	m65	KATE	Later.
L228159	u1005	m65	SETH	See ya.
L228158	u998	m65	KATE	Me too.
L228157	u1005	m65	SETH	I'm sorry.
L228131	u1005	m65	SETH	You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
L228130	u998	m65	KATE	Should I use the last bullets on us?
L228129	u1005	m65	SETH	Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
L228128	u998	m65	KATE	Not many.
L228127	u1005	m65	SETH	How many bullets left, kid?
L228121	u1005	m65	SETH	Anytime.
L228120	u998	m65	KATE	Watch my back!
L228076	u998	m65	KATE	Noooo!
L228075	u1005	m65	SETH	Daddy's dead.
L228074	u998	m65	KATE	We have to go back for Daddy!
L228000	u1005	m65	SETH	Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
L227999	u998	m65	KATE	I'm really sorry.
L227998	u1005	m65	SETH	Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
L227997	u998	m65	KATE	Are you okay?
L227930	u998	m65	KATE	Okay.
L227929	u1005	m65	SETH	How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
L227837	u1005	m65	SETH	"In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, ""Digayo."" When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called ""The Titty Twister."" From what I hear, you can't miss it."
L227836	u998	m65	KATE	You're gonna let us go?
L227756	u1005	m65	SETH	Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
L227755	u998	m65	KATE	Yeah, we got a bible.
L227754	u1005	m65	SETH	You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
L227753	u998	m65	KATE	Yeah.
L227688	u1005	m65	SETH	You damn well better. Go.
L227687	u998	m65	KATE	Yes.
L227686	u1005	m65	SETH	Do you believe me?
L227685	u998	m65	KATE	Yes.
L227684	u1005	m65	SETH	You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
L227649	u1005	m65	SETH	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
L227648	u998	m65	KATE	Creepy guy.
L227500	u998	m65	KATE	Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
L227499	u1004	m65	SCOTT	-- see this, television!
L227498	u998	m65	KATE	-- you got your shower --
L227497	u1004	m65	SCOTT	-- you got your sink --
L227496	u998	m65	KATE	-- you got your microwave --
L227495	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
L227596	u1006	m65	STANLEY CHASE	I would say that's a very safe assumption.
L227595	u999	m65	KELLY HOUGE	Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
L227594	u1006	m65	STANLEY CHASE	This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
L227593	u999	m65	KELLY HOUGE	What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
L227592	u1006	m65	STANLEY CHASE	We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
L227591	u999	m65	KELLY HOUGE	Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
L227590	u1006	m65	STANLEY CHASE	Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
L227589	u999	m65	KELLY HOUGE	Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
L227588	u1006	m65	STANLEY CHASE	For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
L227466	u1001	m65	PETE	Six-fifty.
L227465	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
L227449	u1001	m65	PETE	Knock yourself out.
L227448	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
L227447	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
L227446	u1001	m65	PETE	That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
L227445	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
L227444	u1001	m65	PETE	You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
L227443	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
L227442	u1001	m65	PETE	Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
L227441	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
L227440	u1001	m65	PETE	Whatsamatter?
L227439	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
L227438	u1001	m65	PETE	I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
L227437	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	Not even for lunch?
L227436	u1001	m65	PETE	Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
L227435	u1000	m65	MCGRAW	Hot goddamn day!
L227480	u1005	m65	SETH	Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
L227479	u1001	m65	PETE	I never said help us!
L227459	u1005	m65	SETH	You callin' him a liar?
L227458	u1001	m65	PETE	I wasn't scratching!
L227457	u1005	m65	SETH	He says you were scratching.
L227456	u1001	m65	PETE	What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
L227455	u1005	m65	SETH	Were you giving that pig signals?
L227454	u1005	m65	SETH	"I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to ""Benny's World of Blood."""
L227453	u1001	m65	PETE	He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
L227452	u1005	m65	SETH	Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
L227451	u1001	m65	PETE	What do you want from me? I did what you said.
L227917	u1005	m65	SETH	I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
L227916	u1002	m65	RAZOR CHARLIE	Best in Mexico.
L227900	u1002	m65	RAZOR CHARLIE	This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
L227899	u1005	m65	SETH	Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
L227898	u1002	m65	RAZOR CHARLIE	This is a private club. You're not welcome.
L227897	u1005	m65	SETH	What dya mean?
L227896	u1002	m65	RAZOR CHARLIE	You can't come in here.
L227895	u1005	m65	SETH	Whiskey!
L227968	u1005	m65	SETH	Scarred for life, that's how I am!
L227967	u1003	m65	RICHARD	How are you?
L227957	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
L227956	u1005	m65	SETH	Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
L227955	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yeah.
L227954	u1005	m65	SETH	Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
L227886	u1005	m65	SETH	Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
L227885	u1003	m65	RICHARD	It don't look together.
L227884	u1005	m65	SETH	My shit is together.
L227883	u1003	m65	RICHARD	No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
L227882	u1005	m65	SETH	I'm here with you.
L227881	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Where are you?
L227880	u1005	m65	SETH	What do you mean?
L227879	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Where are you right now?
L227878	u1005	m65	SETH	How?
L227877	u1003	m65	RICHARD	You're lookin' green.
L227876	u1005	m65	SETH	No, Richie, what do I look like?
L227875	u1003	m65	RICHARD	You know what you look like?
L227874	u1005	m65	SETH	That's what you look like.
L227873	u1003	m65	RICHARD	I'm lookin' scared?
L227872	u1005	m65	SETH	That's how you're lookin', Richie.
L227871	u1003	m65	RICHARD	That's what you think?
L227861	u1005	m65	SETH	It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
L227860	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
L227859	u1005	m65	SETH	When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
L227858	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
L227857	u1005	m65	SETH	Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
L227856	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
L227855	u1005	m65	SETH	They broke when you fell.
L227854	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Far out.  Where are my glasses?
L227853	u1005	m65	SETH	Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
L227852	u1003	m65	RICHARD	We are?
L227851	u1005	m65	SETH	"We are...  ""South of the border down Mexico way."""
L227850	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What?
L227849	u1005	m65	SETH	Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
L227848	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
L227847	u1005	m65	SETH	Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
L227846	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Really?
L227845	u1005	m65	SETH	Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
L227844	u1003	m65	RICHARD	I did?
L227843	u1005	m65	SETH	I don't know, you just passed out.
L227842	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yeah, I think so. What happened?
L227841	u1005	m65	SETH	You okay?
L227816	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
L227815	u1005	m65	SETH	This ain't the time.
L227814	u1003	m65	RICHARD	I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
L227798	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Or what?
L227797	u1005	m65	SETH	Keep your voice down.
L227796	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
L227795	u1005	m65	SETH	This ain't the time, Richard.
L227794	u1003	m65	RICHARD	You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
L227793	u1005	m65	SETH	Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
L227792	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
L227791	u1005	m65	SETH	No, I didn't.
L227790	u1003	m65	RICHARD	You just called me a fuckin' nut.
L227789	u1005	m65	SETH	What?
L227788	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What does that mean?
L227787	u1005	m65	SETH	As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
L227786	u1003	m65	RICHARD	They're gonna search the van.
L227785	u1005	m65	SETH	Duly noted. Now, shut up.
L227784	u1003	m65	RICHARD	I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
L227783	u1005	m65	SETH	Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
L227782	u1003	m65	RICHARD	This isn't gonna work.
L227770	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What?
L227769	u1005	m65	SETH	Richard!
L227633	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yes, Seth, I understand.
L227632	u1005	m65	SETH	Yes, Seth, I understand.
L227631	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yes.
L227630	u1005	m65	SETH	Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
L227629	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Seth, if you were me --
L227628	u1005	m65	SETH	This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
L227627	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What?
L227626	u1005	m65	SETH	Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
L227625	u1003	m65	RICHARD	It's not your fault, it's her fault!
L227624	u1005	m65	SETH	Is it me? Is it my fault?
L227623	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
L227622	u1005	m65	SETH	No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
L227621	u1003	m65	RICHARD	There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
L227620	u1005	m65	SETH	Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
L227616	u1005	m65	SETH	What the fuck is she doin' there?!
L227615	u1003	m65	RICHARD	She's in the other room.
L227614	u1005	m65	SETH	What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
L227613	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What?
L227612	u1005	m65	SETH	Where's the woman?
L227611	u1005	m65	SETH	I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
L227610	u1003	m65	RICHARD	How do you know?
L227609	u1005	m65	SETH	Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
L227608	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
L227607	u1005	m65	SETH	I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
L227606	u1003	m65	RICHARD	They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
L227605	u1005	m65	SETH	Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
L227604	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Didya look at the border?
L227603	u1005	m65	SETH	Cops.
L227602	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What'd ya see?
L227601	u1005	m65	SETH	Sight seein'.
L227600	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
L227550	u1005	m65	SETH	-- This conversation is over.
L227549	u1003	m65	RICHARD	All I'm saying --
L227548	u1005	m65	SETH	"These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word ""barter"".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent."
L227547	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Did you even to try to negotiate?
L227546	u1005	m65	SETH	That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
L227545	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
L227541	u1005	m65	SETH	I'm gonna go get the money.
L227540	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Feels good.
L227539	u1005	m65	SETH	I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
L227538	u1003	m65	RICHARD	How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
L227537	u1005	m65	SETH	How's it feel?
L227530	u1005	m65	SETH	They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
L227529	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Do they have a waterbed?
L227528	u1005	m65	SETH	No.
L227527	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Do they have an X-rated channel?
L227526	u1005	m65	SETH	No.
L227525	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Do they have cable?
L227487	u1005	m65	SETH	He didn't recognize shit.
L227486	u1003	m65	RICHARD	What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
L227485	u1005	m65	SETH	What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
L227484	u1005	m65	SETH	One... Two... Three.
L227483	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Gotcha!
L227482	u1005	m65	SETH	When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
L227481	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Yeah?
L227478	u1003	m65	RICHARD	"I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, ""Help us!"""
L227477	u1005	m65	SETH	Richie? You okay?
L227476	u1005	m65	SETH	Shut up and start the car.
L227475	u1003	m65	RICHARD	You believe me don't cha?
L227474	u1005	m65	SETH	Start the car.
L227473	u1003	m65	RICHARD	Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
L227472	u1005	m65	SETH	What the fuck is wrong with you --
L227468	u1003	m65	RICHARD	He signaled the Ranger.
L227467	u1005	m65	SETH	What the fuck was that about?
L228079	u1004	m65	SCOTT	He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
L228078	u1005	m65	SETH	He needs our help!
L228077	u1004	m65	SCOTT	He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
L228050	u1005	m65	SETH	Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
L228049	u1004	m65	SCOTT	You could take their head off.
L227950	u1005	m65	SETH	Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
L227949	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Yeah, it's mine.
L227948	u1005	m65	SETH	In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
L227926	u1004	m65	SCOTT	Okay, I'll have one.
L227925	u1005	m65	SETH	How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
L247505	u1031	m67	LUCY	Go in there. Talk to her.
L247504	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Me!? You where the one...
L247503	u1031	m67	LUCY	"All that ""you gotta be vicious"" stuff you filled her head with."
L247502	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	What?
L247501	u1031	m67	LUCY	In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
L247500	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Where's Audrey?
L247499	u1031	m67	LUCY	What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
L247498	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Who the hell are all these people?
L247227	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Great. See ya then.
L247226	u1031	m67	LUCY	Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
L247167	u1031	m67	LUCY	Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
L247166	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
L247165	u1031	m67	LUCY	I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
L247160	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Big bites.
L247159	u1031	m67	LUCY	Shut up. How can you eat like that?
L247158	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	That's cuz I'm married to you.
L247709	u1025	m67	AUDREY	No.
L247708	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
L247687	u1025	m67	AUDREY	But we can get to the west side faster.
L247686	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
L247685	u1025	m67	AUDREY	The JFK? In the rain!?
L247684	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
L247683	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
L247650	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Oh yes he will.
L247649	u1025	m67	AUDREY	He's not going to do it.
L247616	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Only one way to find out.
L247615	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Think we can fit up in there?
L247587	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
L247586	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Don't you think we have enough?
L247529	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
L247528	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What are you doing?
L247524	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
L247523	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What are you doing?
L247520	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
L247519	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Animal, I can't.
L247518	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
L247517	u1025	m67	AUDREY	My God. He's going after the nest.
L247516	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
L247515	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah. Why are you asking?
L247514	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
L247513	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
L247512	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	You made a mistake.
L247511	u1025	m67	AUDREY	It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
L247510	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	You okay?
L247439	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	We know, Audrey.
L247438	u1025	m67	AUDREY	He stole my report! That's my report!
L247222	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
L247221	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
L247194	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Nearly four years...
L247193	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
L247191	u1025	m67	AUDREY	No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
L247190	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	That why you dumped him?
L247170	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Well, I can be tough if I want.
L247169	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
L247168	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
L247164	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
L247163	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	I like that image.
L247720	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh, just some insurance guy.
L247719	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Who was that French guy, anyway.
L247677	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Really? I'd like to find out.
L247676	u1034	m67	NICK	You'd be surprised.
L247675	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
L247674	u1034	m67	NICK	Are you okay?
L247659	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Oh my God! They're coming!
L247658	u1034	m67	NICK	If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
L247641	u1034	m67	NICK	Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
L247640	u1025	m67	AUDREY	The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
L247639	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Our network covers the Ranger games.
L247638	u1034	m67	NICK	How do you know?
L247637	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
L247635	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
L247634	u1034	m67	NICK	Circuits are overloaded.
L247631	u1034	m67	NICK	I was wrong.
L247630	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
L247629	u1034	m67	NICK	What are you doing here?
L247457	u1034	m67	NICK	So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
L247456	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
L247455	u1034	m67	NICK	I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
L247454	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You never said it was off the record.
L247453	u1034	m67	NICK	Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
L247452	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
L247387	u1034	m67	NICK	Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
L247386	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Nesting?
L247385	u1034	m67	NICK	The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
L247384	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
L247383	u1034	m67	NICK	Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
L247382	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Are you sure?
L247381	u1034	m67	NICK	...he's pregnant.
L247379	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What else do you know about it?
L247378	u1034	m67	NICK	I got pretty close.
L247377	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
L247376	u1034	m67	NICK	Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
L247375	u1025	m67	AUDREY	And you think this creature is one of them?
L247374	u1034	m67	NICK	I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
L247373	u1025	m67	AUDREY	And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
L247372	u1034	m67	NICK	When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
L247371	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
L247369	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Sure. I'd like that.
L247368	u1034	m67	NICK	Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
L247367	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I'm sorry you feel that way.
L247366	u1034	m67	NICK	Most people don't.
L247365	u1025	m67	AUDREY	That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
L247364	u1034	m67	NICK	You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
L247363	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You're still mad at me, aren't you?
L247362	u1034	m67	NICK	"No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real ""boring"" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises..."
L247361	u1025	m67	AUDREY	So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
L247360	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah, well...
L247359	u1034	m67	NICK	You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
L247358	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What?
L247357	u1034	m67	NICK	So you made it.
L247356	u1025	m67	AUDREY	It's good to see you, Nick.
L247355	u1034	m67	NICK	Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
L247354	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You must have quite some harem.
L247353	u1034	m67	NICK	I'll take them all.
L247277	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
L247276	u1031	m67	LUCY	Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
L247275	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Wish me luck!
L247266	u1031	m67	LUCY	I left my forgery kit back at the office.
L247265	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
L247264	u1031	m67	LUCY	Your old sweetheart?
L247263	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
L247262	u1031	m67	LUCY	What the hell are you doing?
L247196	u1025	m67	AUDREY	That's the problem. He did.
L247195	u1031	m67	LUCY	Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
L247189	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Nick Tatopoulos.
L247188	u1031	m67	LUCY	Did Romeo have a name?
L247176	u1025	m67	AUDREY	He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
L247175	u1031	m67	LUCY	Who is he?
L247174	u1025	m67	AUDREY	It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
L247162	u1031	m67	LUCY	He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
L247161	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
L247157	u1031	m67	LUCY	Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
L247156	u1025	m67	AUDREY	My life sucks.
L247090	u1031	m67	LUCY	Speak of the devil.
L247089	u1025	m67	AUDREY	And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
L247273	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You're kidding, right?
L247272	u1029	m67	KID	Five bucks.
L247271	u1025	m67	AUDREY	The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
L247270	u1029	m67	KID	What do I get?
L247269	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Can I use some?
L247268	u1029	m67	KID	What's it to you?
L247267	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
L247707	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
L247706	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
L247705	u1025	m67	AUDREY	We? I don't think so.
L247704	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
L247234	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
L247233	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You don't understand, I can get us information...
L247232	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	Not now. You got my bag?
L247231	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
L247230	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	What?
L247229	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
L247106	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	It's your choice.
L247105	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I can't.
L247104	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	So have dinner with me tonight.
L247103	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
L247102	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	Call me Charlie.
L247101	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Mr. Caiman...
L247100	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	And you're beautiful...
L247099	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Mr. Caiman, you're married.
L247097	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
L247096	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
L247095	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Just tell me, did you talk with him?
L247094	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	This is not the place...
L247093	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Did you talk with Humphries?
L247446	u1027	m67	ELSIE	I'll try.
L247445	u1034	m67	NICK	Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
L247444	u1034	m67	NICK	Me too.
L247443	u1027	m67	ELSIE	I'm sorry about all this.
L247206	u1034	m67	NICK	I don't think so.
L247205	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
L247153	u1034	m67	NICK	More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
L247152	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Hence the radiation.
L247114	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
L247113	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Well, I think you're cute.
L247112	u1034	m67	NICK	Not for a long time, now.
L247111	u1027	m67	ELSIE	You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
L247110	u1034	m67	NICK	No. Perhaps I work too much.
L247109	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Really? A girlfriend then?
L247108	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh, I'm not married.
L247107	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
L247081	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
L247080	u1034	m67	NICK	Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
L247613	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
L247612	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	They didn't make it.
L247611	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Where's Luc and Pierre?
L247610	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	We've secured the doors on both levels.
L247493	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	That is when we will go in.
L247492	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
L247428	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Allez, allez!
L247427	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	Merde!
L247298	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
L247297	u1030	m67	LT. ANDERSON	And how should we do that, Sir?
L247296	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Have them sealed off.
L247295	u1030	m67	LT. ANDERSON	Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
L247294	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
L247293	u1030	m67	LT. ANDERSON	When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
L247124	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Get your people out of there or I will.
L247123	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Major, what do you think could have done this?
L247122	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
L247121	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	That is our job.
L247120	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You're fast.
L247119	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
L247117	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	They are with me!
L247116	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
L247436	u1034	m67	NICK	No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
L247435	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You gave them the tape?
L247414	u1034	m67	NICK	It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
L247413	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
L247412	u1034	m67	NICK	No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
L247408	u1034	m67	NICK	Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
L247407	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
L247406	u1034	m67	NICK	Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
L247301	u1034	m67	NICK	When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
L247300	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	What are you suggesting?
L247299	u1034	m67	NICK	You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
L247151	u1034	m67	NICK	What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
L247150	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
L247149	u1034	m67	NICK	The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
L247076	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
L247075	u1034	m67	NICK	Somebody must have seen it.
L247074	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
L247073	u1034	m67	NICK	But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
L247072	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	That's right.
L247071	u1034	m67	NICK	That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
L247068	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You're standing on it.
L247067	u1034	m67	NICK	What sample?
L247066	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
L247065	u1034	m67	NICK	They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
L247064	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
L247063	u1034	m67	NICK	It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
L247062	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
L247061	u1034	m67	NICK	The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
L247060	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Yeah, you're the worm guy.
L247059	u1034	m67	NICK	Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
L247058	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We know.
L247057	u1034	m67	NICK	Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
L247056	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
L247055	u1034	m67	NICK	You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
L247054	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Follow me.
L247053	u1034	m67	NICK	Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
L247052	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
L247051	u1034	m67	NICK	It's Tatopoulos.
L247050	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
L247604	u1033	m67	MAYOR	You don't have the authority to do that.
L247603	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
L247601	u1033	m67	MAYOR	That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
L247600	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
L247599	u1033	m67	MAYOR	Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
L247405	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
L247404	u1033	m67	MAYOR	Last time you didn't even scratch it!
L247403	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
L247286	u1033	m67	MAYOR	But you don't know for sure!
L247285	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
L247718	u1034	m67	NICK	Wait.  Au revoir.
L247717	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.

L247607	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	What'd they say?
L247596	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
L247595	u1034	m67	NICK	How do I do that?
L247594	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
L247584	u1034	m67	NICK	Good idea.
L247583	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	I think we should leave now.
L247561	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	You were right.
L247560	u1034	m67	NICK	Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
L247541	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
L247540	u1034	m67	NICK	They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.

L247491	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
L247490	u1034	m67	NICK	Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
L247489	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
L247488	u1034	m67	NICK	Sure.
L247487	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
L247485	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	I am not permitted to speak of such things.
L247484	u1034	m67	NICK	So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
L247483	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
L247482	u1034	m67	NICK	How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
L247478	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	We, have already taken care of them.
L247477	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
L247476	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
L247475	u1034	m67	NICK	Why do you need that?
L247474	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	I need you to trust me.
L247473	u1034	m67	NICK	Why are you telling this to me?
L247472	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	We know.
L247471	u1034	m67	NICK	Are you sure? How do you know?
L247470	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
L247469	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh.
L247468	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	It's the French Secret Service.
L247467	u1034	m67	NICK	Sounds like a big company.

L236157	u1088	m71	GREER	After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
L236156	u1086	m71	DODGE	You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
L236131	u1088	m71	GREER	Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
L236130	u1086	m71	DODGE	The turbine blew.
L236129	u1088	m71	GREER	Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
L236128	u1086	m71	DODGE	When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
L236081	u1086	m71	DODGE	Wrong. It's Friday.
L236080	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't know. Tuesday?
L236079	u1086	m71	DODGE	What day is it?
L235992	u1086	m71	DODGE	You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
L235991	u1088	m71	GREER	I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
L235990	u1086	m71	DODGE	I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
L235983	u1088	m71	GREER	Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
L235982	u1086	m71	DODGE	Let's not be too hasty.
L235921	u1088	m71	GREER	She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
L235920	u1086	m71	DODGE	Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
L235893	u1088	m71	GREER	We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
L235892	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
L235889	u1088	m71	GREER	It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
L235888	u1086	m71	DODGE	What's so great about Sweden?
L235865	u1088	m71	GREER	Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
L235864	u1086	m71	DODGE	One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
L235805	u1088	m71	GREER	Morning, skipper.
L235804	u1086	m71	DODGE	Damn mind of it's own.
L235803	u1088	m71	GREER	Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
L235802	u1086	m71	DODGE	Fucker!
L235798	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
L235797	u1088	m71	GREER	Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
L235745	u1086	m71	DODGE	Lemme see.
L235744	u1088	m71	GREER	That's what it says.
L235743	u1086	m71	DODGE	What? You sure?
L235742	u1088	m71	GREER	Sixty pounds.
L235741	u1086	m71	DODGE	How about now?
L235730	u1086	m71	DODGE	Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
L235729	u1088	m71	GREER	You think the extra strain caused it?
L235714	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
L235713	u1086	m71	DODGE	They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
L235712	u1088	m71	GREER	Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
L235575	u1086	m71	DODGE	With that coxswain dickhead.
L235574	u1088	m71	GREER	Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
L235549	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
L235548	u1088	m71	GREER	Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
L236215	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, yeah.
L236214	u1087	m71	EPPS	Get up.
L236213	u1086	m71	DODGE	What?
L236212	u1087	m71	EPPS	Dodge.  Dodge.
L236162	u1087	m71	EPPS	Why not?
L236161	u1086	m71	DODGE	What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
L236100	u1086	m71	DODGE	Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
L236099	u1087	m71	EPPS	Did you?
L236083	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right. Wednesday.
L236082	u1087	m71	EPPS	Try Wednesday.
L236018	u1086	m71	DODGE	Then what the hell happened to him?
L236017	u1087	m71	EPPS	Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
L236015	u1086	m71	DODGE	I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
L236014	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
L236013	u1086	m71	DODGE	A what?
L236012	u1087	m71	EPPS	I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
L235960	u1087	m71	EPPS	Oh yeah.
L235959	u1086	m71	DODGE	Smokes?
L235952	u1087	m71	EPPS	Seen a lota movies.
L235951	u1086	m71	DODGE	Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
L235939	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe he isn't alone.
L235938	u1086	m71	DODGE	One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
L235934	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
L235933	u1087	m71	EPPS	So we kill him?
L235932	u1086	m71	DODGE	Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
L235923	u1086	m71	DODGE	Gimme a break.
L235922	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe that is his boat.
L235917	u1087	m71	EPPS	I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
L235916	u1086	m71	DODGE	Light in those passages ain't so good.
L235885	u1087	m71	EPPS	I like my job.
L235884	u1086	m71	DODGE	What're you crazy?
L235883	u1087	m71	EPPS	Guess I'll just keep working.
L235875	u1086	m71	DODGE	I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
L235874	u1087	m71	EPPS	What other choices have we got?
L235870	u1086	m71	DODGE	Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
L235869	u1087	m71	EPPS	This's gonna hurt a little.
L235851	u1087	m71	EPPS	Or uninvited guests.
L235850	u1086	m71	DODGE	Last thing we want is extra partners.
L235800	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
L235799	u1087	m71	EPPS	If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
L235718	u1087	m71	EPPS	Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
L235717	u1086	m71	DODGE	Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
L235698	u1087	m71	EPPS	Bring it on, dude.
L235697	u1086	m71	DODGE	Ready?
L235696	u1086	m71	DODGE	Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
L235695	u1087	m71	EPPS	Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
L235694	u1086	m71	DODGE	Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
L235666	u1086	m71	DODGE	Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
L235665	u1087	m71	EPPS	Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
L235664	u1086	m71	DODGE	Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
L235623	u1087	m71	EPPS	No.
L235622	u1086	m71	DODGE	You think that's funny
L235621	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah.
L235620	u1087	m71	EPPS	Roger?
L235619	u1086	m71	DODGE	Roger.
L235617	u1086	m71	DODGE	Maureen?
L235616	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maureen.
L235615	u1086	m71	DODGE	What?
L235614	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maureen.
L235613	u1086	m71	DODGE	It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
L235612	u1087	m71	EPPS	What?
L235611	u1086	m71	DODGE	What is your first name?
L235610	u1086	m71	DODGE	Why not.
L235609	u1087	m71	EPPS	One more?
L235547	u1087	m71	EPPS	Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
L235546	u1086	m71	DODGE	Where from?
L236219	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right.
L236218	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Don't fall asleep.
L236217	u1086	m71	DODGE	Sorry.
L236216	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You're late.
L236159	u1086	m71	DODGE	There's a charming thought.
L236158	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
L236146	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right.
L236145	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
L236144	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Then you're a lucky man.
L236143	u1086	m71	DODGE	I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
L236142	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If money can buy what he wants.
L236141	u1086	m71	DODGE	That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
L236118	u1086	m71	DODGE	Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
L236117	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What the hell happened!
L236116	u1086	m71	DODGE	You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
L236115	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Yeah.
L236065	u1086	m71	DODGE	Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
L236064	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Conveniently enough for you.
L236063	u1086	m71	DODGE	I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
L236062	u1086	m71	DODGE	I didn't touch the fucking radio.
L236061	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
L236060	u1086	m71	DODGE	What the fuck -- ?
L236059	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Don't lie to me!
L236058	u1086	m71	DODGE	What?!
L236057	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You smashed it!
L236056	u1086	m71	DODGE	Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
L236055	u1086	m71	DODGE	The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
L236054	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The radio!
L236053	u1086	m71	DODGE	Maybe you can tell me then.
L236052	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think you know.
L236051	u1086	m71	DODGE	I don't know what you're talking about?
L236050	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
L236048	u1086	m71	DODGE	With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
L236047	u1089	m71	MURPHY	There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
L236046	u1086	m71	DODGE	For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
L236045	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What do you propose?
L236044	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
L236043	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
L236042	u1086	m71	DODGE	Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
L236041	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How do you mean?
L236040	u1086	m71	DODGE	So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
L236035	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If they knew what they were carrying.
L236034	u1086	m71	DODGE	On a passenger ship in 1953?
L236023	u1086	m71	DODGE	Not me.
L236022	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
L236008	u1086	m71	DODGE	I think you better see this for yourself.
L236007	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What is it?
L236006	u1086	m71	DODGE	"You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on ""C"" deck. Cabin 400."
L236005	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Murphy.
L236004	u1086	m71	DODGE	Dodge to Murphy.
L235989	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right.
L235988	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
L235987	u1086	m71	DODGE	I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
L235986	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Can't you use something else?
L235978	u1086	m71	DODGE	So whoever did this might still be around.
L235977	u1089	m71	MURPHY	That'd be my guess.
L235974	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Could be meant as a warning.
L235973	u1086	m71	DODGE	Damn barbaric is what it is.
L235970	u1086	m71	DODGE	Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
L235969	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Bodies're too fresh.
L235950	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
L235949	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
L235943	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
L235942	u1086	m71	DODGE	What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
L235931	u1086	m71	DODGE	Why not? Why the fuck not?
L235930	u1089	m71	MURPHY	And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
L235929	u1086	m71	DODGE	I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
L235926	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not in the eyes of the law.
L235925	u1086	m71	DODGE	Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
L235924	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
L235900	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
L235899	u1086	m71	DODGE	Sounds like the hull.
L235895	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, yeah.
L235894	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
L235882	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How about you Epps?
L235881	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
L235855	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
L235854	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
L235845	u1089	m71	MURPHY	So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
L235844	u1086	m71	DODGE	You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
L235841	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It looks like it.
L235840	u1086	m71	DODGE	Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
L235839	u1089	m71	MURPHY	A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
L235838	u1086	m71	DODGE	So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
L235836	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
L235835	u1086	m71	DODGE	Or somebody stopped them.
L235829	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Then it happened before they scuttled her.
L235828	u1086	m71	DODGE	Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
L235821	u1089	m71	MURPHY	A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
L235820	u1086	m71	DODGE	What, you think there's something funny about it?
L235819	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's a hell of a lot of money.
L235810	u1089	m71	MURPHY	She take a radio?
L235809	u1086	m71	DODGE	Went aboard.
L235796	u1086	m71	DODGE	Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
L235795	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
L235782	u1086	m71	DODGE	What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
L235781	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Goddamit, Dodge.
L235780	u1086	m71	DODGE	Three, four days.
L235779	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How long?
L235778	u1086	m71	DODGE	I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
L235777	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How long, then?
L235776	u1086	m71	DODGE	It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
L235775	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What about running number two by itself?
L235774	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
L235773	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
L235772	u1086	m71	DODGE	Hard to say.
L235771	u1089	m71	MURPHY	But how long?
L235770	u1086	m71	DODGE	The right way and the wrong way.
L235769	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I know I know, two ways to do anything --
L235768	u1086	m71	DODGE	Like I always say --
L235767	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How much longer's that gonna take?
L235766	u1086	m71	DODGE	Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
L235765	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I thought you said it was just a blade.
L235764	u1086	m71	DODGE	Turbine rotor's shot.
L235763	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What's this?
L235728	u1086	m71	DODGE	Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
L235727	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How long to fix?
L235726	u1086	m71	DODGE	The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
L235724	u1086	m71	DODGE	Threw a turbine blade.
L235723	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What is it?
L235722	u1086	m71	DODGE	Mother fucker!
L235711	u1086	m71	DODGE	Sounds reasonable.
L235710	u1089	m71	MURPHY	With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
L235677	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
L235676	u1086	m71	DODGE	It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
L235673	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's a risk I'm willing to take.
L235672	u1086	m71	DODGE	If you get it back in one piece.
L235671	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
L235670	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
L235637	u1086	m71	DODGE	Smugglers maybe.
L235636	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
L235577	u1086	m71	DODGE	Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
L235576	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
L236263	u1088	m71	GREER	I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
L236262	u1087	m71	EPPS	I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
L236251	u1087	m71	EPPS	Nothing. Let's get outa here.
L236250	u1088	m71	GREER	What?
L236249	u1087	m71	EPPS	Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
L236248	u1088	m71	GREER	You okay?
L236231	u1087	m71	EPPS	Better than starving to death.
L236230	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
L236078	u1088	m71	GREER	I feel fine.
L236077	u1087	m71	EPPS	Sudden flashes of light.
L236076	u1088	m71	GREER	Lights?
L236075	u1087	m71	EPPS	Headache, nausea, lights?
L236074	u1088	m71	GREER	No.
L236073	u1087	m71	EPPS	Any dizziness?
L235976	u1087	m71	EPPS	Because of the gold.
L235975	u1088	m71	GREER	Stay away. Or else.
L235956	u1087	m71	EPPS	You're a pal.
L235955	u1088	m71	GREER	Coffee.
L235919	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
L235918	u1088	m71	GREER	What'd he look like?
L235891	u1088	m71	GREER	Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
L235890	u1087	m71	EPPS	That's a good thing?
L235859	u1088	m71	GREER	Hell yeah.
L235858	u1087	m71	EPPS	That's what I call a payday.
L235857	u1088	m71	GREER	Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
L235834	u1087	m71	EPPS	Probably didn't have time.
L235833	u1088	m71	GREER	Then why didn't they take it.
L235831	u1088	m71	GREER	Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
L235830	u1087	m71	EPPS	You mean, before she sank.
L235740	u1088	m71	GREER	He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
L235739	u1087	m71	EPPS	Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
L235635	u1088	m71	GREER	Too big. More like a freighter.
L235634	u1087	m71	EPPS	Could be a fishing boat.
L235603	u1088	m71	GREER	I bet you did.
L235602	u1087	m71	EPPS	Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
L235601	u1088	m71	GREER	Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
L235600	u1087	m71	EPPS	Morning everybody.
L235545	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
L235544	u1088	m71	GREER	What's slow?
L236333	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
L236332	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't give a damn about the gold.
L236331	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
L236330	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
L236329	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
L236328	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
L236327	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think I see it pretty well.
L236326	u1087	m71	EPPS	Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
L236325	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I didn't want it to turn out this way.
L236324	u1087	m71	EPPS	And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
L236323	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
L236322	u1087	m71	EPPS	So you killed them?
L236321	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
L236320	u1087	m71	EPPS	You killed them.
L236313	u1087	m71	EPPS	Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
L236312	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
L236311	u1087	m71	EPPS	What?
L236310	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We hit land.
L236309	u1087	m71	EPPS	What happened?
L236283	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
L236282	u1087	m71	EPPS	If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
L236281	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
L236279	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
L236278	u1087	m71	EPPS	They went crazy.
L236277	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe it was more than that.
L236276	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Over the gold.
L236275	u1087	m71	EPPS	"Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. ""Like wild dogs."""
L236274	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What do you think?
L236256	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
L236255	u1087	m71	EPPS	What do we do with him?
L236243	u1087	m71	EPPS	Right here.
L236242	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Epps? You there?
L236236	u1089	m71	MURPHY	He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
L236235	u1087	m71	EPPS	Nope.
L236234	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Either of you seen Dodge?
L236233	u1087	m71	EPPS	Epps, over.
L236232	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Murphy to Epps.
L236207	u1087	m71	EPPS	Just lucky I guess.
L236206	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
L236205	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't know.
L236204	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What's that supposed to mean?
L236203	u1087	m71	EPPS	She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
L236202	u1087	m71	EPPS	More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
L236201	u1089	m71	MURPHY	That much I think we've already established.
L236200	u1087	m71	EPPS	Something bad happened here, Murphy.
L236199	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Victims of what?
L236198	u1087	m71	EPPS	No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
L236197	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
L236196	u1087	m71	EPPS	What happened.
L236195	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Showing you what?
L236194	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
L236192	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
L236191	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What, like some kind of ghost?
L236189	u1087	m71	EPPS	No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
L236188	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not our mystery guest again.
L236187	u1087	m71	EPPS	When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
L236186	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I don't know, are we?
L236185	u1087	m71	EPPS	Are we smart enough to avoid that?
L236184	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
L236183	u1087	m71	EPPS	The what?
L236182	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
L236181	u1087	m71	EPPS	What do you think happened on this boat?
L236180	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Wish I could say the same.
L236179	u1087	m71	EPPS	Couldn't sleep.
L236178	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Hey.
L236177	u1087	m71	EPPS	Hey.
L236174	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Doesn't matter.
L236173	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's not gonna hold us.
L236127	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
L236126	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
L236113	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If it was a ship she hit.
L236112	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
L236111	u1089	m71	MURPHY	But where's the damage?
L236110	u1087	m71	EPPS	The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
L236109	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Collision? With what?
L236108	u1087	m71	EPPS	Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made.
L236107	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
L236106	u1087	m71	EPPS	The same day she supposedly went down.
L236105	u1089	m71	MURPHY	February first.
L236104	u1087	m71	EPPS	The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill.
L236097	u1087	m71	EPPS	But, who -- ?
L236096	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Smashed it up pretty bad.
L236095	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Somebody took it out of commission last night.
L236094	u1087	m71	EPPS	What?
L236093	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The ah... the radio's out.
L236038	u1087	m71	EPPS	Only something must've gone wrong.
L236037	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
L236036	u1087	m71	EPPS	You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
L236033	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
L236032	u1087	m71	EPPS	They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
L236031	u1089	m71	MURPHY	No. I'll try again later.
L236030	u1087	m71	EPPS	Same. Any luck?
L236029	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How's he doing?
L236025	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
L236024	u1087	m71	EPPS	He needs a doctor.
L236021	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
L236020	u1087	m71	EPPS	Greer?
L236019	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
L235966	u1087	m71	EPPS	Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
L235965	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You just shoot at something?
L235964	u1087	m71	EPPS	Epps.
L235963	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Murphy to Epps.
L235958	u1087	m71	EPPS	Yup.
L235957	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Got your light?
L235954	u1087	m71	EPPS	No cowboy shit. Right.
L235953	u1089	m71	MURPHY	No cowboy shit up there, understand?
L235945	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
L235944	u1087	m71	EPPS	Guess that'd be me. Again.
L235928	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
L235927	u1087	m71	EPPS	So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
L235915	u1087	m71	EPPS	It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
L235914	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You sure it wasn't me?
L235913	u1087	m71	EPPS	Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
L235912	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Are you sure?
L235911	u1087	m71	EPPS	I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
L235910	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What? What the hell're you talking about.
L235909	u1087	m71	EPPS	There's somebody else on this boat.
L235908	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What guy?
L235907	u1087	m71	EPPS	The guy. He just came this way.
L235906	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Who?
L235905	u1087	m71	EPPS	Did you see him?
L235904	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Take it easy, you'll live longer.
L235849	u1089	m71	MURPHY	For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
L235848	u1087	m71	EPPS	Why not call for help?
L235825	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
L235824	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
L235762	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Only way to be.
L235761	u1087	m71	EPPS	You're more practical than superstitious.
L235760	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
L235759	u1087	m71	EPPS	You think she's sailing without a crew?
L235758	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
L235757	u1087	m71	EPPS	So what did happen?
L235756	u1089	m71	MURPHY	She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
L235755	u1087	m71	EPPS	Nope.
L235754	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
L235752	u1087	m71	EPPS	Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
L235751	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
L235750	u1087	m71	EPPS	She was sailing up north, right?
L235749	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
L235748	u1087	m71	EPPS	What'd you find up there?
L235747	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Yeah. Thanks.
L235746	u1087	m71	EPPS	Coffee?
L235716	u1087	m71	EPPS	They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
L235715	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
L235680	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
L235679	u1087	m71	EPPS	Go on.
L235605	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's my pen name.
L235604	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Candy?
L236265	u1088	m71	GREER	Fine with me.
L236264	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
L236261	u1088	m71	GREER	All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
L236260	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You think whoever did this is reasonable?
L236259	u1088	m71	GREER	Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
L236258	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Leave it.
L236257	u1088	m71	GREER	What about the gold?
L236254	u1088	m71	GREER	Doesn't look like it much matters.
L236253	u1089	m71	MURPHY	So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
L236252	u1088	m71	GREER	Can't find the shotgun.
L236238	u1088	m71	GREER	Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
L236237	u1089	m71	MURPHY	He took the shotgun and a light.
L236172	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The mooring hasn't come taught.
L236171	u1088	m71	GREER	We're still drifting.
L236168	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
L236167	u1088	m71	GREER	A what?
L236166	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's a Noaa buoy.
L236135	u1088	m71	GREER	Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
L236134	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Shut up.
L236133	u1088	m71	GREER	Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
L236125	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
L236124	u1088	m71	GREER	We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
L236120	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
L236119	u1088	m71	GREER	We're not gonna be able to pump it!
L236092	u1088	m71	GREER	I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
L236091	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
L236090	u1088	m71	GREER	Oh, man.
L236089	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
L236088	u1088	m71	GREER	Say what?
L236087	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You've been out for about a day.
L236086	u1088	m71	GREER	Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
L236085	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You don't remember?
L236084	u1088	m71	GREER	What happened?
L236072	u1088	m71	GREER	Lost my sea legs.
L236071	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How're you feeling?
L236070	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Drink up then.
L236069	u1088	m71	GREER	Never been more thirsty in my life.
L235980	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Maybe.
L235979	u1088	m71	GREER	Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
L235972	u1088	m71	GREER	And look what happened.
L235971	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
L235968	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
L235967	u1088	m71	GREER	Ho-ly shit.
L235947	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
L235946	u1088	m71	GREER	Pretty low all around.
L235941	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
L235940	u1088	m71	GREER	I say we off-load some of that gold now.
L235937	u1088	m71	GREER	Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
L235936	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
L235935	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't know.
L235887	u1088	m71	GREER	Moving to Sweden.
L235886	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Greer?
L235880	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
L235879	u1088	m71	GREER	Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
L235873	u1088	m71	GREER	And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
L235872	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We could call for help.
L235871	u1088	m71	GREER	What now?
L235853	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
L235852	u1088	m71	GREER	I heard that.
L235847	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
L235846	u1088	m71	GREER	Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
L235843	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
L235842	u1088	m71	GREER	So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
L235823	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
L235822	u1088	m71	GREER	If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
L235816	u1088	m71	GREER	Ho, baby!
L235815	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
L235814	u1088	m71	GREER	How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
L235808	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
L235807	u1088	m71	GREER	You're up late.
L235806	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Morning.
L235732	u1088	m71	GREER	Yeah.
L235731	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
L235675	u1089	m71	MURPHY	So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
L235674	u1088	m71	GREER	All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
L235669	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We've done it before.
L235668	u1088	m71	GREER	You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
L235667	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
L235660	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Sorry.
L235659	u1088	m71	GREER	Murphy, goddamit.
L235655	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
L235654	u1088	m71	GREER	How's that?
L235653	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's funny.
L235641	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
L235640	u1088	m71	GREER	Call the Coastguard?
L235633	u1088	m71	GREER	Looks like it's adrift.
L235632	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Too deep to anchor out there.
L235628	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Alright. I'll be right up.
L235627	u1088	m71	GREER	I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
L235626	u1088	m71	GREER	There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
L235625	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Yeah.
L235607	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
L235606	u1088	m71	GREER	Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
L235572	u1088	m71	GREER	"Better than ""making hamburger for Mickey D."""
L235571	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You got that right.
L235570	u1088	m71	GREER	I must be in the wrong business.
L235569	u1089	m71	MURPHY	He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
L235568	u1088	m71	GREER	Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
L235555	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What do you say, Dodge?
L235554	u1088	m71	GREER	Let the buyer beware.
L235553	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Of course they did.
L235552	u1088	m71	GREER	The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
L235551	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Go.
L235550	u1088	m71	GREER	Greer to Murphy.
L235594	u1090	m71	RIVETER	Or what?
L235593	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
L235592	u1090	m71	RIVETER	These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
L235591	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
L235590	u1090	m71	RIVETER	Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
L235589	u1089	m71	MURPHY	As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
L235588	u1090	m71	RIVETER	Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
L235587	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
L235567	u1091	m71	VASILI	You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
L235566	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You're kidding, right?
L235565	u1091	m71	VASILI	Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
L235564	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Fifteen, at the most.
L235563	u1091	m71	VASILI	That cost me twenty grand at least.
L235562	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
L235561	u1091	m71	VASILI	No, no. You got leak.
L235560	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
L235559	u1091	m71	VASILI	What's this?
L235558	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Better late than never.
L235557	u1091	m71	VASILI	I thought you say Tuesday.
L239796	u1136	m75	BRIDE	What's the matter, dear?
L239795	u1141	m75	GROOM	Uuuuuuugh!!
L239794	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
L239792	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Have I done the right thing?
L239791	u1141	m75	GROOM	To the bathroom, where do you think?
L239790	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Now where are you going?
L239789	u1136	m75	BRIDE	I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
L239788	u1141	m75	GROOM	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
L239787	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Roy?  Your clock broke.
L239785	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Well, thanks a lot.
L239784	u1141	m75	GROOM	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
L239783	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Aren't you glad we waited?
L239577	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I was just going to say ""eight.""  You're fantastic!"
L239576	u1137	m75	COED	Eight o'clock?
L239575	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
L239569	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
L239568	u1137	m75	COED	Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
L239567	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
L239554	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
L239553	u1137	m75	COED	No.  They're just coming to me.
L239552	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
L239551	u1137	m75	COED	Ummm -- figure eight?
L239550	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ready?  What is it?
L239546	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
L239545	u1137	m75	COED	Is it a star?
L240310	u1138	m75	DANA	All right, what happened to me?
L240309	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
L240308	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
L240220	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.
L240219	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Are you the Gatekeeper?
L240015	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I got the Twister game for later ...
L240014	u1138	m75	DANA	Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
L240013	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
L240012	u1138	m75	DANA	Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
L240011	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
L240010	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L240009	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you.
L239676	u1138	m75	DANA	I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
L239675	u1144	m75	LOUIS	You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
L239674	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
L239673	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
L239672	u1138	m75	DANA	No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
L239671	u1144	m75	LOUIS	"Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped ""20 Minute Workout"" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?"
L239670	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you sick, Louis?
L239669	u1144	m75	LOUIS	... I thought it was the drug store.
L239668	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L239667	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you ...
L240316	u1138	m75	DANA	Talk to my accountant. 
L240315	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
L240314	u1138	m75	DANA	Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
L240313	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
L240312	u1138	m75	DANA	Really!  Is it gone?
L240311	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
L240064	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Whoa!! Nice voice.
L240063	u1138	m75	DANA	There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
L240062	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
L240061	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am ...
L240060	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
L240059	u1138	m75	DANA	I want you inside me.
L240058	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
L240056	u1138	m75	DANA	Take me now.
L240055	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
L240054	u1138	m75	DANA	Do you want this body?
L240053	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
L240052	u1138	m75	DANA	He is the Destructor.
L240051	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
L240050	u1138	m75	DANA	We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
L240048	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
L240047	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
L239944	u1138	m75	DANA	I've got to go now.
L239943	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
L239942	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  Since you put it that way.
L239941	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
L239940	u1138	m75	DANA	I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
L239939	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
L239938	u1138	m75	DANA	What's he doing in my refrigerator.
L239937	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
L239936	u1138	m75	DANA	"Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  ""Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."""
L239935	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
L239934	u1138	m75	DANA	You must have gotten the last copy.
L239933	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name ""Zuul"" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it."
L239932	u1138	m75	DANA	Can't you tell me now?
L239931	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
L239930	u1138	m75	DANA	He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
L239929	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Is he dying or something?
L239928	u1138	m75	DANA	"The ""stiff?""  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man."
L239927	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who's the stiff?
L239926	u1138	m75	DANA	I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
L239925	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
L239924	u1138	m75	DANA	Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
L239923	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're the best one in your row.
L239922	u1138	m75	DANA	You heard it?
L239921	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great rehearsal.
L239776	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No kiss?
L239775	u1138	m75	DANA	Goodbye.
L239774	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Then I'll go.
L239773	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.
L239772	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
L239771	u1138	m75	DANA	Then leave.
L239770	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Don't scream.
L239769	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll scream.
L239768	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I want to help you.
L239767	u1138	m75	DANA	Out!
L239766	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On a purely scientific basis.
L239765	u1138	m75	DANA	That's it.  Get out.
L239764	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I think I should spend the night here.
L239763	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  What do you want to do?
L239762	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
L239761	u1138	m75	DANA	Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
L239760	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
L239759	u1138	m75	DANA	This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
L239758	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
L239757	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.
L239756	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you all right?
L239755	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Damn!
L239753	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I know.  It happened by itself.
L239752	u1138	m75	DANA	I told you, I ...
L239751	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're quite a housekeeper.
L239750	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll wait here if you don't mind.
L239749	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, let's check it out.
L239748	u1138	m75	DANA	Uh-huh.
L239747	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
L239746	u1138	m75	DANA	What?
L239745	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	That's too bad.
L239743	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Thanks.  What's in there?
L239742	u1138	m75	DANA	Like a used car salesman.
L239741	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No?  What do I act like?
L239740	u1138	m75	DANA	You really don't act like a scientist.
L239739	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
L239738	u1138	m75	DANA	That's a violin concerto.
L239737	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
L239736	u1138	m75	DANA	Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
L239735	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
L239734	u1138	m75	DANA	No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
L239733	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
L239732	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"Spengler,  see if you can find the word ""Zuul"" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment."
L239731	u1138	m75	DANA	No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
L239728	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's in the stars.
L239727	u1138	m75	DANA	Is that your professional opinion?
L239720	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
L239719	u1138	m75	DANA	Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
L239715	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So what do you think it was?
L239714	u1138	m75	DANA	... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
L239711	u1138	m75	DANA	Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
L239710	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We're all professionals here, Miss ...
L239709	u1138	m75	DANA	Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
L239708	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
L239640	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I see.
L239639	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	"Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of ""dodge"" or ""hustle.""  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University."
L239638	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But why?  The students love us!
L239637	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
L239636	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
L239635	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
L239634	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
L240323	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	That would definitely explain it.
L240322	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
L240321	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
L240320	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
L240319	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
L240032	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
L240031	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
L240030	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	That is one speedy mutt.
L239621	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We'll get back to you.
L239620	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Did you see it?  What was it?
L239602	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
L239601	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	What's that got to do with it?
L239593	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
L239592	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
L239591	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
L239590	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
L240232	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Thank you.
L240231	u1143	m75	JANINE	Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
L240230	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't believe in luck.
L240229	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
L240228	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240227	u1143	m75	JANINE	I want you to have this. 
L240118	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's so romantic.
L240117	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
L240116	u1143	m75	JANINE	In the physical sense.
L240115	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Die in what sense?
L240114	u1143	m75	JANINE	Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
L239707	u1143	m75	JANINE	Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
L239706	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I think it's the food of the future.
L239705	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, that's very - unusual.
L239704	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I collect spores, molds and fungus.
L239703	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
L239702	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Is that a game?
L239701	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
L239700	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Print is dead.
L239699	u1143	m75	JANINE	You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
L239966	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
L239965	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
L239964	u1143	m75	JANINE	I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
L239963	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The EPA?  What's he want?
L239962	u1143	m75	JANINE	And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
L239958	u1143	m75	JANINE	Here are tonight's calls.
L239957	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
L239713	u1143	m75	JANINE	What calls?
L239712	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
L239805	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
L239804	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
L239803	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Did you ever report it to anyone?
L239802	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
L239801	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Has this ever happened before?
L239800	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
L240208	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
L240207	u1146	m75	PECK	"That's ""Peck!"""
L240206	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
L240197	u1146	m75	PECK	Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
L240196	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
L240157	u1146	m75	PECK	See!  They are using drugs.
L240156	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
L240132	u1146	m75	PECK	Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
L240131	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
L239995	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
L239994	u1146	m75	PECK	Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
L239993	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
L239992	u1146	m75	PECK	Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
L239991	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why do you want to see it?
L239990	u1146	m75	PECK	May I please see the storage facility?
L239989	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"The magic word is ""please."""
L239988	u1146	m75	PECK	And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
L239987	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Because you didn't say the magic word.
L239986	u1146	m75	PECK	And why not, Mr. Venkman?
L239985	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No, you may not.
L239984	u1146	m75	PECK	And may I see this storage facility?
L239983	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, it would.
L239982	u1146	m75	PECK	And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
L239981	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	In a storage facility.
L239980	u1146	m75	PECK	And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
L239979	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm not at liberty to say.
L239978	u1146	m75	PECK	And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
L239977	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You could say that.
L239976	u1146	m75	PECK	I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
L239975	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
L239974	u1146	m75	PECK	Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
L239973	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
L239972	u1146	m75	PECK	Are you Peter Venkman?
L239971	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  How's it going?
L239970	u1146	m75	PECK	I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
L239969	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Can I help you?
L239565	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Then my theory was correct.
L239564	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
L239563	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
L239562	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
L239561	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
L239560	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
L239559	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sorry.  This isn't your day.
L239558	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Two wavy lines?
L239557	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
L239556	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yes.  I don't like this.
L239555	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nervous?
L239549	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Close -- but definitely wrong.
L239548	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Circle?
L239543	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good guess -- but no.
L239542	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	A square?
L239541	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	All right.  What is it?
L239902	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wow!
L239901	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
L239900	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
L239899	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
L239898	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
L239897	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
L239896	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
L239828	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
L239827	u1154	m75	WOMAN	You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
L239826	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
L239825	u1154	m75	WOMAN	What on earth gave you that idea?
L239824	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Were you recently in the bathroom?
L239823	u1154	m75	WOMAN	Yes?
L240302	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But it's my favorite state.
L240301	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Life is just a state of mind.
L240300	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
L240299	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
L240298	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
L240289	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Full-stream with strogon pulse.
L240288	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What now?
L240184	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
L240183	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	You talked to Gozer?
L240182	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer.
L240181	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Who?
L240180	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"She said he was ""the Destructor."""
L240179	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
L240178	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
L240177	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
L240153	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, shit!
L240152	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Where's the Keymaster?
L240134	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
L240133	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	He wants to shut down the storage grid.
L240113	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right, Peter.  Good night.
L240112	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
L240111	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right.  I'll try.
L240110	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
L240109	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I agree.
L240108	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
L240107	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
L240106	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
L240105	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Does she want to be?
L240104	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
L240103	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240102	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
L239858	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
L239857	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"What do you mean ""bad?"""
L239856	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Trust me.  It will be bad.
L239855	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why not?
L239854	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Don't cross the beams.
L239853	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?
L239852	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
L239819	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, I can smell it.
L239818	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Something was definitely here.
L239780	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
L239779	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Did you see anything?
L239718	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
L239717	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
L239656	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
L239655	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
L239629	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Wow!
L239628	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm always serious.
L239627	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
L239589	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
L239588	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
L239587	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What have you got, Egon?
L239586	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh!  You're here.
L240272	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	That appears to be the case.
L240271	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
L240170	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
L240169	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
L240151	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
L240150	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What happened??!!!?
L240000	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
L239999	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239998	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I've got to sleep.
L239997	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Neutronize.  System shut.
L239996	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Set entry grid.
L239869	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
L239868	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's working!
L239832	u1150	m75	STANTZ	God, it's ugly!
L239831	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
L239817	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	We'd better adjust our streams.
L239816	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sorry, Buddy!
L239811	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I blame myself.
L239810	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
L239722	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
L239721	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
L240287	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
L240286	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
L240285	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
L240280	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look!
L240279	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?  What popped in there?
L240278	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
L240262	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
L240261	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Agile bastard, isn't he?
L240255	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, that ought to do it.
L240254	u1150	m75	STANTZ	As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
L240252	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't think it's Shandor.
L240251	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
L240176	u1150	m75	STANTZ	He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
L240175	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who was the architect?
L240174	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
L240173	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
L240006	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's not good, Pete.
L240005	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239956	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
L239955	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy, that was a rough one.
L239845	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
L239844	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	How do you know?
L239843	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
L239842	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
L239841	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
L239840	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
L239839	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Third floor.  Get down here,
L239838	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Where are you, Pete?
L239837	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray -- Something's here.
L239822	u1150	m75	STANTZ	All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
L239821	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
L239820	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
L239814	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
L239813	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No sense worrying about it now.
L239812	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So do I.
L239782	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
L239781	u1150	m75	STANTZ	They will.
L239778	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
L239777	u1150	m75	STANTZ	How was your date?
L239730	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
L239729	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
L239697	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Fourteen hundred.
L239696	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
L239695	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
L239663	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of ""pricey"" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company."
L239662	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Wow!  Does this pole still work?
L239658	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
L239657	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But most people are afraid to even report these things.
L239654	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
L239653	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
L239652	u1150	m75	STANTZ	My parents left me that house, I was born there.
L239651	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You'll never regret this, Ray.
L239649	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	To go into business for ourselves.
L239648	u1150	m75	STANTZ	For what purpose?
L239647	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
L239646	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
L239645	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
L239644	u1150	m75	STANTZ	This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
L239642	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
L239641	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
L239633	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
L239632	u1150	m75	STANTZ	If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
L239631	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
L239624	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
L239623	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
L239622	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get her?  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
L239615	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
L239614	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
L239613	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Anything!  Just make contact.
L239612	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do I say?
L239611	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  Talk to it.
L239610	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do we do now?
L239609	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I told you it's real.
L239607	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
L239606	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What is it?
L239583	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
L239582	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
L239581	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Looked at with your eyes.
L239580	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean by ""seen?"""
L239579	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
L239578	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
L239574	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
L239573	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
L239572	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
L239571	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
L240268	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean ""choose?""  We don't understand."
L240267	u1153	m75	WINSTON	What's he talking about?  Choose what?
L240121	u1150	m75	STANTZ	LATER, MAN!!
L240120	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Stantz?  You okay in there?
L240088	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  We'll believe anything.
L240087	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
L240083	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
L240082	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
L240081	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, Judgement Day.
L240080	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Judgement Day ...
L240079	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  And the sky would fall ...
L240078	u1150	m75	STANTZ	And the seas would boil ...
L240077	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
L240076	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
L240075	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
L240074	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
L240073	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Do you believe in God?
L240072	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
L240071	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too.
L240070	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Mmmhmmm.
L240069	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Are you a Christian, Ray?
L240068	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
L240067	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
L239968	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
L239967	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
L257693	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
L257692	u1218	m80	CARTER	Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
L257690	u1218	m80	CARTER	The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
L257689	u1217	m80	BLAKE	We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
L257622	u1217	m80	BLAKE	It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
L257621	u1218	m80	CARTER	Carter.
L257602	u1218	m80	CARTER	Sweet dreams, Blake.
L257601	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Yes.
L257600	u1218	m80	CARTER	What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
L257599	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
L257598	u1218	m80	CARTER	Care to join me?
L257597	u1217	m80	BLAKE	That's it?
L257584	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Charming.
L257583	u1218	m80	CARTER	I can be real stiff.
L257582	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Only the real stiffs.
L257581	u1218	m80	CARTER	You take all your dates here. Blake?
L257551	u1218	m80	CARTER	Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
L257550	u1217	m80	BLAKE	The cemetery...
L257549	u1218	m80	CARTER	Where?
L257548	u1217	m80	BLAKE	It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
L257547	u1218	m80	CARTER	Carter.
L257490	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Girl scouts.
L257489	u1218	m80	CARTER	Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
L257488	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
L257487	u1218	m80	CARTER	As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
L257486	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
L257485	u1218	m80	CARTER	The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
L257484	u1218	m80	CARTER	No blood on the knife.
L257483	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
L257482	u1218	m80	CARTER	Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
L257479	u1217	m80	BLAKE	That don't match either of the victim's.
L257478	u1218	m80	CARTER	One set of muddy shoe prints.
L257474	u1218	m80	CARTER	I like a woman who takes control.
L257473	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
L257472	u1218	m80	CARTER	Well, when you put it that way.
L257471	u1217	m80	BLAKE	Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
L257470	u1218	m80	CARTER	With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
L257469	u1217	m80	BLAKE	They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
L257468	u1218	m80	CARTER	Why am I here?
L257467	u1217	m80	BLAKE	It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
L257466	u1218	m80	CARTER	No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
L257703	u1223	m80	KERI	Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
L257702	u1218	m80	CARTER	Funny, we just drove right in.
L257701	u1223	m80	KERI	I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
L257700	u1218	m80	CARTER	Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
L257699	u1223	m80	KERI	... I think it would be best if you both left.
L257698	u1218	m80	CARTER	Carter.
L257697	u1223	m80	KERI	Detective...
L257696	u1218	m80	CARTER	Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
L257695	u1223	m80	KERI	I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
L257694	u1218	m80	CARTER	Mind if we sit down?
L257688	u1223	m80	KERI	Do I know you?
L257687	u1218	m80	CARTER	I'll be damned.
L257639	u1219	m80	DEPUTY CLARK	Doesn't look good.
L257638	u1223	m80	KERI	Think Eddie had something to do with it?
L257637	u1219	m80	DEPUTY CLARK	Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
L257636	u1223	m80	KERI	Do you know who did this?
L257635	u1219	m80	DEPUTY CLARK	Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
L257634	u1223	m80	KERI	My god...
L257633	u1219	m80	DEPUTY CLARK	It's Amy Kramer.
L257632	u1223	m80	KERI	A dead body?
L257631	u1219	m80	DEPUTY CLARK	Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
L257630	u1223	m80	KERI	Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
L257564	u1220	m80	EDDIE	Would somebody shut this guy up?
L257563	u1227	m80	SHANE	Another historical inaccuracy.
L257560	u1227	m80	SHANE	It's not historically accurate, that's all.
L257559	u1220	m80	EDDIE	Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
L257558	u1227	m80	SHANE	Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
L257557	u1220	m80	EDDIE	What the fuck are you talking about?
L257556	u1227	m80	SHANE	Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
L257414	u1221	m80	JIMMY	Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
L257413	u1226	m80	PAMELA	My office?
L257412	u1221	m80	JIMMY	Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
L257411	u1226	m80	PAMELA	Nothing's missing?
L257410	u1221	m80	JIMMY	Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
L257409	u1226	m80	PAMELA	You sure?
L257408	u1221	m80	JIMMY	Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
L257404	u1221	m80	JIMMY	And miss the big game?  No way.
L257403	u1226	m80	PAMELA	No.  Wait for the police.
L257402	u1221	m80	JIMMY	Checking out your place.
L257401	u1226	m80	PAMELA	Jimmy, what are you doing?
L257398	u1226	m80	PAMELA	No shit.
L257397	u1221	m80	JIMMY	No shit?!
L257396	u1226	m80	PAMELA	I think someone broke into my house.
L257395	u1221	m80	JIMMY	Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
L257394	u1226	m80	PAMELA	My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
L257393	u1221	m80	JIMMY	Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
L257842	u1223	m80	KERI	That would work.
L257841	u1222	m80	JOHN	Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
L257840	u1223	m80	KERI	Call me Laurie, will ya?
L257839	u1222	m80	JOHN	Yeah, me too, Keri.
L257815	u1223	m80	KERI	Please, get on the bus...
L257814	u1222	m80	JOHN	Oh, God... no... not Molly.
L257813	u1223	m80	KERI	John...
L257812	u1222	m80	JOHN	What?  Where is she?
L257811	u1223	m80	KERI	John, you can't help her now.
L257810	u1222	m80	JOHN	I'm not leaving without her.
L257809	u1223	m80	KERI	Just get on the bus.
L257808	u1222	m80	JOHN	Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
L257807	u1223	m80	KERI	Get on the bus.
L257806	u1222	m80	JOHN	He found you, didn't he?
L257750	u1222	m80	JOHN	I don't know.
L257749	u1223	m80	KERI	Where are you going?
L257748	u1223	m80	KERI	I was trying to protect you from this...
L257747	u1222	m80	JOHN	Why didn't you tell me?
L257746	u1223	m80	KERI	No.
L257745	u1222	m80	JOHN	Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
L257744	u1223	m80	KERI	Yes.
L257743	u1222	m80	JOHN	Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
L257738	u1223	m80	KERI	Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
L257737	u1222	m80	JOHN	Now you're joking, right?
L257732	u1223	m80	KERI	I was trying to get away from someone.
L257731	u1222	m80	JOHN	You some kind of fugitive or something?
L257726	u1223	m80	KERI	Will, sit down...
L257725	u1222	m80	JOHN	I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
L257612	u1222	m80	JOHN	Just forget it...
L257611	u1223	m80	KERI	Oh, so now it's my fault?
L257610	u1222	m80	JOHN	Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
L257609	u1223	m80	KERI	It's an option.
L257608	u1222	m80	JOHN	Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
L257607	u1223	m80	KERI	Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
L257606	u1222	m80	JOHN	I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
L257605	u1223	m80	KERI	You're kidding with that answer, right?
L257604	u1222	m80	JOHN	Nothing.
L257603	u1223	m80	KERI	Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
L257443	u1223	m80	KERI	I know.
L257442	u1222	m80	JOHN	You're twisted.
L257441	u1223	m80	KERI	I thought you'd never ask.
L257440	u1222	m80	JOHN	To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
L257439	u1223	m80	KERI	Where are you going?
L257437	u1222	m80	JOHN	My life is a living hell.
L257436	u1223	m80	KERI	I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
L257435	u1222	m80	JOHN	Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
L257434	u1223	m80	KERI	My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
L257433	u1222	m80	JOHN	The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
L257432	u1223	m80	KERI	Forget it.
L257431	u1222	m80	JOHN	I promise not to run off to Cancun.
L257430	u1223	m80	KERI	You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
L257429	u1222	m80	JOHN	Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
L257428	u1223	m80	KERI	No.
L257427	u1222	m80	JOHN	Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
L257426	u1223	m80	KERI	"And I should have a son who calls me ""Mom"".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck."
L257425	u1222	m80	JOHN	I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
L257424	u1223	m80	KERI	Betcha' didn't predict that.
L257423	u1222	m80	JOHN	What the --
L257422	u1222	m80	JOHN	You're so predictable.
L257421	u1223	m80	KERI	"Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still ""no."""
L257661	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Yeah.
L257660	u1222	m80	JOHN	Better?
L257659	u1222	m80	JOHN	Here, take my jacket.
L257658	u1225	m80	MOLLY	I'm okay.
L257657	u1222	m80	JOHN	You look kind of cold.
L257656	u1225	m80	MOLLY	I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
L257655	u1222	m80	JOHN	You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
L257654	u1225	m80	MOLLY	You really think Eddie killed her?
L257653	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
L257652	u1222	m80	JOHN	Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
L257651	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Then I'll get caught.
L257650	u1222	m80	JOHN	Then you come out here.
L257649	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
L257648	u1222	m80	JOHN	Can I come in?
L257647	u1225	m80	MOLLY	I can see that.  Why?
L257646	u1222	m80	JOHN	I came to see you.
L257645	u1225	m80	MOLLY	What are you doing here?!
L257626	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
L257625	u1222	m80	JOHN	Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
L257517	u1225	m80	MOLLY	I can't afford to get caught.
L257516	u1222	m80	JOHN	Why not?
L257515	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Not me.
L257512	u1222	m80	JOHN	I borrowed it.
L257511	u1225	m80	MOLLY	You stole it?
L257510	u1222	m80	JOHN	Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
L257509	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Where'd you get it?
L257508	u1222	m80	JOHN	Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
L257718	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Michael Meyers!
L257717	u1223	m80	KERI	Who?!
L257716	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Linda!  He killed Linda!
L257667	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Okay... thank you.
L257666	u1223	m80	KERI	Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
L257665	u1225	m80	MOLLY	I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.

L257756	u1228	m80	WILL	Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
L257755	u1223	m80	KERI	Yeah.
L257754	u1228	m80	WILL	So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
L257753	u1228	m80	WILL	Never.

L257751	u1228	m80	WILL	You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
L257742	u1223	m80	KERI	Shit happens.

L257616	u1228	m80	WILL	Hey, you alright?
L257544	u1223	m80	KERI	Bye Will.
L257543	u1228	m80	WILL	A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
L257542	u1223	m80	KERI	I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
L257540	u1228	m80	WILL	Doesn't make it bad advice.
L257539	u1223	m80	KERI	Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
L257538	u1228	m80	WILL	The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
L257537	u1223	m80	KERI	It's not going to happen.
L257536	u1228	m80	WILL	This kid just wants his freedom.
L257535	u1223	m80	KERI	He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
L257534	u1228	m80	WILL	Still wants to move out?
L257533	u1223	m80	KERI	It's always John.
L257532	u1228	m80	WILL	It's John, isn't it?
L257530	u1223	m80	KERI	Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
L257529	u1228	m80	WILL	You okay?  You seem a little off.
L257528	u1223	m80	KERI	Looks great.  It does.
L257527	u1228	m80	WILL	Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
L257785	u1224	m80	LINDA	Can't you?
L257784	u1227	m80	SHANE	Can't you hold it?
L257783	u1224	m80	LINDA	I have to pee.
L257782	u1227	m80	SHANE	What is it?
L257781	u1224	m80	LINDA	Wait.
L257624	u1227	m80	SHANE	You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
L257623	u1224	m80	LINDA	Look, they're staring right at us.
L257776	u1224	m80	LINDA	Oh, don't be such a victim.
L257775	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Have enough fun for the both of us.
L257774	u1224	m80	LINDA	Let the party begin.
L257773	u1224	m80	LINDA	Very insightful.
L257772	u1225	m80	MOLLY	But the dance is in the gymnasium.
L257771	u1224	m80	LINDA	Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
L257770	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Where's Shane?
L257769	u1224	m80	LINDA	Thanks!
L257768	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
L257767	u1224	m80	LINDA	Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
L257766	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
L257765	u1224	m80	LINDA	You're so easy...
L257764	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Shit, Linda!
L257763	u1224	m80	LINDA	BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
L257714	u1224	m80	LINDA	Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
L257713	u1225	m80	MOLLY	You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
L257712	u1224	m80	LINDA	I'll pop a Benadryl.
L257711	u1225	m80	MOLLY	I thought you were allergic to latex.
L257710	u1224	m80	LINDA	Shane's going as a condom.
L257679	u1225	m80	MOLLY	Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
L257678	u1224	m80	LINDA	Ooooh, busted.
L257628	u1225	m80	MOLLY	You're unbelievable.
L257627	u1224	m80	LINDA	Better her than me.
L257507	u1224	m80	LINDA	"You say, ""The key to my heart,"" and I'm gonna hurl."
L257506	u1225	m80	MOLLY	What's this?
L257494	u1225	m80	MOLLY	He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
L257493	u1224	m80	LINDA	Fuckin' A.
L257492	u1225	m80	MOLLY	I did alright.
L257491	u1224	m80	LINDA	You aced it, didn't you?
L261202	u1229	m81	BETH	He's in the bathroom.
L261201	u1235	m81	KARA	Is Tim there?
L261200	u1229	m81	BETH	We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
L261199	u1235	m81	KARA	What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
L261198	u1229	m81	BETH	Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
L261197	u1235	m81	KARA	Mom -- Who is this?
L260951	u1229	m81	BETH	You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
L260950	u1235	m81	KARA	No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
L260949	u1229	m81	BETH	Why?  You interested?
L260948	u1235	m81	KARA	Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
L260939	u1229	m81	BETH	Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
L260938	u1235	m81	KARA	Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
L260937	u1229	m81	BETH	He do that to you?
L261194	u1229	m81	BETH	What if it's Kara?
L261193	u1237	m81	TIM	Answer what?
L261192	u1229	m81	BETH	Aren't you gonna answer that?
L261191	u1237	m81	TIM	Then they can watch.
L261190	u1229	m81	BETH	What if your parents come home?
L261189	u1237	m81	TIM	Guess so ...
L261188	u1229	m81	BETH	Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
L261167	u1229	m81	BETH	We can light our own tree at home.
L261166	u1237	m81	TIM	But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
L261165	u1229	m81	BETH	Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
L261164	u1237	m81	TIM	Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
L261163	u1229	m81	BETH	Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
L261083	u1237	m81	TIM	Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
L261082	u1229	m81	BETH	Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
L260959	u1229	m81	BETH	Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
L260958	u1237	m81	TIM	Happy fuckin' Halloween.
L260946	u1229	m81	BETH	Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
L260945	u1237	m81	TIM	Whatever happened to women in back?
L260941	u1237	m81	TIM	Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
L260940	u1229	m81	BETH	Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
L261274	u1235	m81	KARA	Danny!!!
L261273	u1230	m81	DANNY	Mommy!!!
L261186	u1235	m81	KARA	I promise.
L261185	u1230	m81	DANNY	Promise?
L261184	u1235	m81	KARA	No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
L261183	u1230	m81	DANNY	I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
L261182	u1235	m81	KARA	There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
L261181	u1230	m81	DANNY	Mommy, I'm scared.
L261102	u1235	m81	KARA	Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
L261101	u1230	m81	DANNY	Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
L261097	u1235	m81	KARA	You can't expect us to stay here --
L261096	u1230	m81	DANNY	Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
L260835	u1235	m81	KARA	Okay ... But just for tonight.
L260834	u1230	m81	DANNY	No, Mom -- keep it on!
L260832	u1235	m81	KARA	Like what?
L260831	u1230	m81	DANNY	He says things.  Bad things.
L260830	u1235	m81	KARA	You've been watching too much TV.
L260829	u1230	m81	DANNY	But I've seen him!
L260828	u1235	m81	KARA	They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
L260827	u1230	m81	DANNY	The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
L260826	u1235	m81	KARA	Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
L260819	u1230	m81	DANNY	The voice man!  He's here!
L260818	u1235	m81	KARA	Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
L261057	u1231	m81	DEBRA	You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
L261056	u1234	m81	JOHN	Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
L261055	u1231	m81	DEBRA	I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
L261054	u1234	m81	JOHN	What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
L261053	u1231	m81	DEBRA	John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
L261052	u1234	m81	JOHN	What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
L261051	u1231	m81	DEBRA	He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
L261050	u1231	m81	DEBRA	A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
L261049	u1234	m81	JOHN	What is it this time?
L260917	u1231	m81	DEBRA	You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
L260916	u1234	m81	JOHN	See what I'm talkin' about?
L260915	u1234	m81	JOHN	Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
L260914	u1231	m81	DEBRA	Relax, John.  They were just kids.
L260913	u1234	m81	JOHN	Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
L261044	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
L261043	u1231	m81	DEBRA	God ... this can't be true.
L261042	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
L261041	u1231	m81	DEBRA	What should I do?
L261035	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
L261034	u1231	m81	DEBRA	Jamie?  But I thought she was --
L261033	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
L261032	u1231	m81	DEBRA	What makes you think he'll come here again?
L261031	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
L261024	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	I've come to help your family.
L261023	u1231	m81	DEBRA	Who are you?
L261022	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
L260963	u1233	m81	JAMIE	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
L260962	u1232	m81	HARRY SIMMS	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
L260961	u1233	m81	JAMIE	No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
L260960	u1232	m81	HARRY SIMMS	So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
L260891	u1233	m81	JAMIE	It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
L260890	u1232	m81	HARRY SIMMS	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
L260889	u1233	m81	JAMIE	No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
L260888	u1232	m81	HARRY SIMMS	So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
L261280	u1238	m81	TOMMY	It's not working!
L261279	u1235	m81	KARA	Come on!
L261278	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Wait a minute ...
L261277	u1235	m81	KARA	What now?!
L261232	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Kara, no!
L261231	u1235	m81	KARA	Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
L261222	u1238	m81	TOMMY	He's gone.
L261221	u1235	m81	KARA	Where's the baby?!
L261132	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
L261131	u1235	m81	KARA	Danny?!  Danny!
L261129	u1238	m81	TOMMY	To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
L261128	u1235	m81	KARA	Where are you going?
L261127	u1238	m81	TOMMY	'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
L261126	u1235	m81	KARA	Halloween.
L261125	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
L261124	u1235	m81	KARA	Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
L261111	u1235	m81	KARA	It's a rune ... Thorn.
L261110	u1238	m81	TOMMY	It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
L261109	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
L261108	u1235	m81	KARA	Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
L261107	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
L261105	u1235	m81	KARA	Here.  Let me try.
L261104	u1238	m81	TOMMY	God, what's wrong with him?
L261100	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Him.
L261099	u1235	m81	KARA	Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
L261075	u1235	m81	KARA	You stay away from him!
L261074	u1238	m81	TOMMY	I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
L261073	u1235	m81	KARA	My, God!  What have you done to him?
L261071	u1235	m81	KARA	Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
L261070	u1238	m81	TOMMY	She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
L261271	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Leave the boy.  Take me.
L261270	u1239	m81	WYNN	Stay away, Sam.
L261269	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	No!!!
L261256	u1239	m81	WYNN	Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
L261255	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	You've created a monster.
L261249	u1239	m81	WYNN	And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
L261248	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Samhain.
L261247	u1239	m81	WYNN	There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
L261246	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Jamie's baby ...
L261245	u1239	m81	WYNN	She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
L261244	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Why did you take Jamie?
L261243	u1239	m81	WYNN	Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
L261242	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	It was you.
L261241	u1239	m81	WYNN	Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
L261240	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	This is madness, Wynn.
L261239	u1239	m81	WYNN	Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
L261238	u1239	m81	WYNN	Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
L261237	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Where's the child?
L261093	u1239	m81	WYNN	I'll meet you over there.
L261092	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
L261089	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
L261088	u1239	m81	WYNN	No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
L261087	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Any word on the location of the Strodes?
L261086	u1239	m81	WYNN	There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
L261019	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	An old friend.
L261018	u1239	m81	WYNN	There you are.  Who was that boy?
L260996	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
L260995	u1239	m81	WYNN	Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
L260974	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	It's a sign.  He's come home.
L260973	u1239	m81	WYNN	What is that?
L260911	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Or what's left of him.
L260910	u1239	m81	WYNN	Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
L260906	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
L260905	u1239	m81	WYNN	After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
L260904	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
L260903	u1239	m81	WYNN	You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
L260902	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
L260887	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
L260886	u1239	m81	WYNN	But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
L260880	u1239	m81	WYNN	You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
L260879	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
L260878	u1239	m81	WYNN	We need you, Dr. Loomis.
L260875	u1239	m81	WYNN	Retiring.
L260874	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	But surely Rogers isn't --
L260873	u1239	m81	WYNN	As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
L260872	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
L260871	u1239	m81	WYNN	Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
L260868	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
L260867	u1239	m81	WYNN	Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
L261229	u1238	m81	TOMMY	No!!!
L261228	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
L261226	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
L261225	u1238	m81	TOMMY	No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
L261224	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	No one.
L261223	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Who else knew I had the baby?!
L261014	u1238	m81	TOMMY	No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
L261013	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
L261012	u1238	m81	TOMMY	I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
L261011	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	What do you know about Michael?
L261010	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
L261009	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
L261008	u1238	m81	TOMMY	I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
L261007	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	I'm sorry, but do I know you --
L261006	u1238	m81	TOMMY	Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
L261005	u1236	m81	LOOMIS	Yes?
L273833	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	Time to play.
L273832	u1280	m85	FEMALE CENOBITE	No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
L273831	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
L273709	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	We have no more surprises.
L273708	u1280	m85	FEMALE CENOBITE	We've always been here.
L273707	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	It's different for us.
L273699	u1280	m85	FEMALE CENOBITE	Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
L273698	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
L273762	u1282	m85	JULIA	Oh, I do. I do.
L273761	u1281	m85	FRANK	Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
L273760	u1282	m85	JULIA	You knew?
L273759	u1281	m85	FRANK	I knew you'd come.
L273758	u1282	m85	JULIA	Frank.
L273757	u1281	m85	FRANK	Julia.
L273756	u1282	m85	JULIA	Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
L273746	u1281	m85	FRANK	I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
L273745	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
L273741	u1281	m85	FRANK	Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
L273740	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	He... he loved me.
L273738	u1281	m85	FRANK	'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
L273737	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
L273736	u1281	m85	FRANK	See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
L273735	u1281	m85	FRANK	Shit. Bull. Shit.
L273734	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Yes!
L273733	u1281	m85	FRANK	Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
L273868	u1282	m85	JULIA	I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
L273867	u1285	m85	MALAHIDE	I knew you'd come back.
L273720	u1282	m85	JULIA	Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
L273719	u1285	m85	MALAHIDE	I want to go back!
L273675	u1282	m85	JULIA	It certainly is.
L273674	u1285	m85	MALAHIDE	It's coming.
L273673	u1282	m85	JULIA	She certainly has.
L273672	u1285	m85	MALAHIDE	She's done it.
L273600	u1282	m85	JULIA	I know.
L273599	u1285	m85	MALAHIDE	It's a beautiful dress...
L273595	u1285	m85	MALAHIDE	No. You look...
L273594	u1282	m85	JULIA	Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
L273593	u1285	m85	MALAHIDE	Yes... Yes. You look...
L273641	u1284	m85	KYLE	I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
L273640	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Kyle, you don't have...
L273639	u1284	m85	KYLE	O.K. Let's go.
L273636	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Because I'm going to get my father!
L273635	u1284	m85	KYLE	WHY?
L273634	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
L273633	u1284	m85	KYLE	Are you crazy?
L273632	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Get out of the way.
L273629	u1284	m85	KYLE	Yeah. The things you were talking about.
L273628	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
L273627	u1284	m85	KYLE	The boxes! I TOLD you.
L273626	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	What do you mean?
L273625	u1284	m85	KYLE	The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
L273624	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	What?
L273623	u1284	m85	KYLE	The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
L273622	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	The box. I need the box.
L273620	u1284	m85	KYLE	Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
L273619	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
L273618	u1284	m85	KYLE	God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
L273617	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	And you're sure it was a woman?
L273612	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
L273611	u1284	m85	KYLE	Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
L273609	u1284	m85	KYLE	So you slept O.K.?
L273608	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	No bad dreams.
L273568	u1284	m85	KYLE	If anyone can help, HE can.
L273567	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
L273565	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
L273564	u1284	m85	KYLE	Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
L273563	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
L273562	u1284	m85	KYLE	What?
L273561	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	I... I had a visitor.
L273551	u1284	m85	KYLE	Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
L273550	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	God, that's terrible.
L273549	u1284	m85	KYLE	Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
L273548	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	What's the matter with her?
L273547	u1284	m85	KYLE	Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
L273531	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	You a doctor, too?
L273530	u1284	m85	KYLE	So... You're Kirsty, huh?
L273874	u1288	m85	TIFFANY	It's been Hell.
L273873	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Well... G'bye.
L273860	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
L273859	u1288	m85	TIFFANY	I'm scared.
L273854	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Finish what?
L273853	u1288	m85	TIFFANY	I've got to finish it.
L273852	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	What are you talking...
L273851	u1288	m85	TIFFANY	I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
L273845	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	You were ALL human!
L273844	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	I... remember.
L273841	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
L273840	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	Nonsense, I...
L273839	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
L273838	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
L273837	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
L273836	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
L273835	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
L273834	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Wait!
L273706	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	And what about you?
L273705	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
L273702	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	I've come for my father!
L273701	u1286	m85	PINHEAD	Then why are you here?
L273700	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	But I didn't open it! I didn't!
L273518	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	The Cenobites.
L273517	u1287	m85	RONSON	Who?
L273516	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
L273515	u1287	m85	RONSON	Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
L273505	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
L273504	u1287	m85	RONSON	What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
L273498	u1287	m85	RONSON	Yeah.
L273497	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	He talked about Demons, huh?
L273496	u1287	m85	RONSON	Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
L273495	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	I thought Steve had talked to you?
L273488	u1287	m85	RONSON	Oh, excuse me...
L273487	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	What are you talking about? Who are you?
L273486	u1287	m85	RONSON	What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
L273485	u1287	m85	RONSON	Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
L273484	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Steve...
L273483	u1287	m85	RONSON	You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
L273482	u1283	m85	KIRSTY	Where am I?
L274691	u1301	m87	1ST MAN	Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
L274690	u1308	m87	LARRY	You fucking ass-holes.
L274689	u1308	m87	LARRY	My fucking hand!
L274688	u1301	m87	1ST MAN	What's the problem?
L274687	u1308	m87	LARRY	Christ!
L274612	u1301	m87	1ST MAN	Oh, sod you.
L274611	u1308	m87	LARRY	Just take it slowly.
L274610	u1301	m87	1ST MAN	Look, do you want the bed in or not?
L274609	u1308	m87	LARRY	Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
L274701	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Sure.
L274700	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	Will you sign for the bed?
L274696	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Where's my father?
L274695	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	We're leaving.
L274694	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	What's happening?
L274626	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Not much.
L274625	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	Want to buy a bed?
L274624	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Hi.
L274623	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	It's my lucky day.
L274646	u1308	m87	LARRY	Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
L274645	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	Lucky man.
L274644	u1308	m87	LARRY	Julia's my second wife.
L274643	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	Oh.
L274642	u1308	m87	LARRY	Her mother's dead.
L274641	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	Got her mother's looks.
L274640	u1308	m87	LARRY	Uh-huh.
L274639	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	That your daughter?
L274617	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	Do you really need this bed, lady?
L274616	u1308	m87	LARRY	Alright, let's give it another try.
L274614	u1308	m87	LARRY	It'll go in.
L274613	u1302	m87	2ND MAN	Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
L275289	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	You can keep them.
L275288	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	We've got such sights to show you --
L275287	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Stay the fuck away from me.
L275286	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	Just in time.
L275242	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No. That wasn't the deal.
L275241	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	We want the man who did this --
L275196	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
L275195	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
L275192	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	HE did. I've seen him.
L275191	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	Nobody escapes us.
L275188	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	To a man called Frank Cotton?
L275187	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	Many times.
L275186	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	You did this before, right?
L275185	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	No time for argument.
L275183	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
L275182	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Let me alone, will you?
L275166	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No!
L275165	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
L275159	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
L275158	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	This isn't for real.
L275156	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
L275155	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
L275154	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Who are you?
L275153	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
L275152	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	It's just a puzzle box.
L275151	u1303	m87	CENOBITE	The box... you opened it. We came.
L275123	u1304	m87	DOCTOR	We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
L275122	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Oh Christ.
L275121	u1304	m87	DOCTOR	Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
L275120	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I don't remember.
L275119	u1304	m87	DOCTOR	You were holding onto it like grim death.
L275115	u1304	m87	DOCTOR	First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
L275114	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Please listen to me --
L275113	u1304	m87	DOCTOR	You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
L275112	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	It's important.
L275111	u1304	m87	DOCTOR	That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
L275110	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I have to speak to my father.
L275109	u1304	m87	DOCTOR	Please. Get back into bed.
L275273	u1305	m87	FRANK	That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
L275272	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Frank --
L275271	u1305	m87	FRANK	Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
L275270	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Bastard.
L275269	u1305	m87	FRANK	Poor baby.
L275268	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	You bastard --
L275267	u1305	m87	FRANK	Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
L275266	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Oh my God.
L275100	u1305	m87	FRANK	Some things have to be endured...
L275099	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	This isn't happening.
L275098	u1305	m87	FRANK	Come to Daddy.
L275092	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	You want it?
L275091	u1305	m87	FRANK	One last time. Give me the box.
L275090	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No.
L275088	u1305	m87	FRANK	I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
L275087	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	This isn't happening.
L275086	u1305	m87	FRANK	I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
L275085	u1305	m87	FRANK	What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
L275084	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Don't touch me. Or so help me --
L275081	u1305	m87	FRANK	Come to Daddy.
L275080	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No.
L275079	u1305	m87	FRANK	You remember.
L275078	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No.
L275077	u1305	m87	FRANK	Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
L275075	u1305	m87	FRANK	Kirsty?
L275074	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Julia!
L275135	u1305	m87	FRANK	I need a skin. Then we leave --
L275134	u1306	m87	JULIA	Well we can't just stay here --
L275133	u1305	m87	FRANK	Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
L275132	u1306	m87	JULIA	Maybe we should just leave --
L275131	u1305	m87	FRANK	There's very little I can do about it.
L275130	u1306	m87	JULIA	Don't you care?
L275129	u1305	m87	FRANK	Maybe.
L275128	u1306	m87	JULIA	That's probably her now. Or the police.
L275127	u1305	m87	FRANK	I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
L275126	u1306	m87	JULIA	She'll tell them everything...
L275060	u1305	m87	FRANK	Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
L275059	u1306	m87	JULIA	I said no.
L275058	u1305	m87	FRANK	So where's the harm?
L275057	u1306	m87	JULIA	I don't.
L275056	u1305	m87	FRANK	You can't love him.
L274994	u1306	m87	JULIA	Yes. They'll never find us.
L274993	u1305	m87	FRANK	It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
L274992	u1306	m87	JULIA	And the blood let you out?
L274991	u1305	m87	FRANK	They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
L274990	u1305	m87	FRANK	No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
L274989	u1306	m87	JULIA	So you were cheated.
L274988	u1305	m87	FRANK	You would be. They tore me apart.
L274987	u1306	m87	JULIA	You're still afraid.
L274986	u1305	m87	FRANK	The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
L274985	u1306	m87	JULIA	Who did?
L274984	u1305	m87	FRANK	Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
L274983	u1306	m87	JULIA	And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
L274982	u1305	m87	FRANK	I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
L274981	u1306	m87	JULIA	Hell...
L274980	u1305	m87	FRANK	To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
L274979	u1306	m87	JULIA	What kind of doors?
L274978	u1305	m87	FRANK	Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
L274977	u1306	m87	JULIA	Let me see.
L274976	u1305	m87	FRANK	It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
L274975	u1306	m87	JULIA	A box?
L274974	u1305	m87	FRANK	This is what began it.
L274973	u1306	m87	JULIA	You promised me an explanation.
L274972	u1305	m87	FRANK	A long time.
L274969	u1306	m87	JULIA	Tell me, damn you.
L274968	u1305	m87	FRANK	Not know.
L274967	u1306	m87	JULIA	I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
L274966	u1305	m87	FRANK	What?
L274965	u1306	m87	JULIA	Later.
L274964	u1305	m87	FRANK	Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
L274963	u1306	m87	JULIA	Well?
L274945	u1305	m87	FRANK	You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
L274944	u1306	m87	JULIA	You're hurting.
L274943	u1305	m87	FRANK	Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
L274942	u1306	m87	JULIA	Keep your voice down.
L274941	u1305	m87	FRANK	Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
L274937	u1305	m87	FRANK	The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
L274936	u1306	m87	JULIA	Who?
L274935	u1305	m87	FRANK	-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
L274934	u1305	m87	FRANK	One more. Maybe two --
L274933	u1306	m87	JULIA	Good.
L274932	u1305	m87	FRANK	My nerves... are beginning to work again.
L274931	u1306	m87	JULIA	Hurting.
L274930	u1305	m87	FRANK	I'm hurting
L274792	u1305	m87	FRANK	The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
L274791	u1306	m87	JULIA	What do you want me to do.
L274790	u1305	m87	FRANK	You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
L274789	u1306	m87	JULIA	Ssh!
L274788	u1305	m87	FRANK	...somebody...
L274780	u1305	m87	FRANK	Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
L274779	u1306	m87	JULIA	Back from where?
L274778	u1305	m87	FRANK	His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
L274777	u1306	m87	JULIA	What happened to you?
L274776	u1305	m87	FRANK	Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
L274775	u1306	m87	JULIA	No. God no.
L274774	u1305	m87	FRANK	Frank.
L274773	u1306	m87	JULIA	Tell me who you are.
L274772	u1305	m87	FRANK	Help me.
L274771	u1305	m87	FRANK	I said: don't look.
L274770	u1306	m87	JULIA	Who are you?
L274769	u1305	m87	FRANK	Don't look at me.
L274768	u1306	m87	JULIA	Oh my God.
L274767	u1305	m87	FRANK	Julia.
L274733	u1305	m87	FRANK	Sure you are.
L274732	u1306	m87	JULIA	I'm very happy.
L274731	u1305	m87	FRANK	Wedded bliss?
L274681	u1305	m87	FRANK	Forget him.
L274680	u1306	m87	JULIA	What about Larry --
L274676	u1305	m87	FRANK	I don't want to see the dress.
L274675	u1306	m87	JULIA	But you said --
L274674	u1305	m87	FRANK	I don't want to see the dress.
L274673	u1306	m87	JULIA	Well?
L274660	u1306	m87	JULIA	I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
L274659	u1305	m87	FRANK	Well can I come in or not?
L274658	u1306	m87	JULIA	Oh.  Oh yes.
L274657	u1305	m87	FRANK	There is going to BE a wedding?
L274656	u1305	m87	FRANK	I came for the wedding.
L274655	u1306	m87	JULIA	Oh.
L274654	u1305	m87	FRANK	I'm brother Frank.
L274653	u1306	m87	JULIA	That's right. Who are you?
L274652	u1305	m87	FRANK	You're Julia, right?
L275258	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Oh my God.
L275257	u1306	m87	JULIA	No, damn you --
L275220	u1306	m87	JULIA	I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
L275219	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I saw everything.
L275218	u1306	m87	JULIA	This afternoon.
L275217	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I was here this afternoon.
L275216	u1306	m87	JULIA	You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
L275215	u1306	m87	JULIA	Of course. There's no need to shout.
L275214	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I have to see my father.
L275213	u1306	m87	JULIA	What's the problem?
L275212	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Where's Daddy?
L275211	u1306	m87	JULIA	Kirsty? It's very late.
L274722	u1306	m87	JULIA	The keys are in the kitchen.
L274721	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Sure.
L274720	u1306	m87	JULIA	Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
L274719	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	What happened?
L274667	u1306	m87	JULIA	Just to your left.
L274666	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Which is where?
L274665	u1306	m87	JULIA	There's a towel in the bathroom.
L274664	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Hi. I got soaked.
L274663	u1306	m87	JULIA	Kirsty.
L275231	u1308	m87	LARRY	He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
L275230	u1306	m87	JULIA	Dead.
L275149	u1306	m87	JULIA	It's better you see for yourself --
L275148	u1308	m87	LARRY	What are you talking about?
L275147	u1306	m87	JULIA	I don't know where to begin...
L275146	u1308	m87	LARRY	What's wrong?
L275038	u1306	m87	JULIA	Please. I can't bear it...
L275037	u1308	m87	LARRY	What's wrong with you?
L275036	u1306	m87	JULIA	Please...
L275035	u1308	m87	LARRY	Huh?
L275024	u1308	m87	LARRY	Come with me then.
L275023	u1306	m87	JULIA	Don't go upstairs.
L275022	u1308	m87	LARRY	Oh baby.
L275016	u1308	m87	LARRY	What's wrong with you?
L275015	u1306	m87	JULIA	Larry...
L275013	u1308	m87	LARRY	No. I'll do it.
L275012	u1306	m87	JULIA	-- I'll go see.
L275005	u1308	m87	LARRY	Only I'll turn it off --
L275004	u1306	m87	JULIA	Fine.
L275003	u1308	m87	LARRY	Are you all right?
L275002	u1306	m87	JULIA	I've seen worse.
L275001	u1308	m87	LARRY	Is this upsetting you?
L274958	u1308	m87	LARRY	Kirsty.
L274957	u1306	m87	JULIA	Who was it?
L274940	u1308	m87	LARRY	O.K.
L274939	u1306	m87	JULIA	Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
L274928	u1308	m87	LARRY	O.K.
L274927	u1306	m87	JULIA	I'll be down in a minute
L274926	u1308	m87	LARRY	Sure.
L274925	u1306	m87	JULIA	Maybe a brandy.
L274924	u1308	m87	LARRY	Can I get you anything?
L274923	u1306	m87	JULIA	I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
L274922	u1308	m87	LARRY	Oh, babe...
L274921	u1306	m87	JULIA	Just feeling a bit sick.
L274920	u1308	m87	LARRY	Are you all right?
L274919	u1308	m87	LARRY	Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
L274918	u1306	m87	JULIA	I'm here.
L274917	u1308	m87	LARRY	Julia?
L274754	u1308	m87	LARRY	Are you O.K.?
L274753	u1306	m87	JULIA	Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
L274729	u1308	m87	LARRY	Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
L274728	u1306	m87	JULIA	Larry....
L274727	u1308	m87	LARRY	Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
L274718	u1306	m87	JULIA	No you won't.
L274717	u1308	m87	LARRY	I'll be scarred for life.
L274716	u1306	m87	JULIA	You're done worse.
L274715	u1308	m87	LARRY	So damn stupid.
L274714	u1306	m87	JULIA	Take it slowly.
L274712	u1306	m87	JULIA	No, you're not.
L274711	u1308	m87	LARRY	I'm going to throw up.
L274710	u1306	m87	JULIA	It's probably going to need stitches.
L274709	u1306	m87	JULIA	Let me see.
L274708	u1308	m87	LARRY	Shit.
L274707	u1306	m87	JULIA	You're NOT going to faint.
L274706	u1308	m87	LARRY	I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
L274705	u1306	m87	JULIA	Is it deep?
L274704	u1308	m87	LARRY	I cut myself.
L274703	u1306	m87	JULIA	What have you done?
L274619	u1306	m87	JULIA	It looks like a bomb's dropped.
L274618	u1308	m87	LARRY	How are you doing through there?
L274606	u1308	m87	LARRY	We'll move in Sunday.
L274605	u1306	m87	JULIA	Why not?
L274604	u1308	m87	LARRY	Well?
L274568	u1308	m87	LARRY	He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
L274567	u1306	m87	JULIA	He's here?
L274564	u1306	m87	JULIA	In here.
L274563	u1308	m87	LARRY	Where are you?
L274562	u1308	m87	LARRY	I hear you.
L274561	u1306	m87	JULIA	Larry!
L274558	u1308	m87	LARRY	Oh Christ. Julia...
L274557	u1306	m87	JULIA	No argument.
L274556	u1308	m87	LARRY	So what's the argument?
L274555	u1306	m87	JULIA	All right.
L274554	u1308	m87	LARRY	You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
L274553	u1306	m87	JULIA	No. I'm not.
L274552	u1308	m87	LARRY	You're still blaming me.
L274549	u1306	m87	JULIA	You mean we're moving in?
L274548	u1308	m87	LARRY	You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
L274547	u1308	m87	LARRY	He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
L274546	u1306	m87	JULIA	I thought half of it was your brother's?
L274545	u1308	m87	LARRY	We'll sell it. Sell everything.
L274544	u1306	m87	JULIA	Not exactly modern.
L274542	u1308	m87	LARRY	I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
L274541	u1306	m87	JULIA	Why didn't he want to sell it?
L274537	u1308	m87	LARRY	The best part of ten years.
L274536	u1306	m87	JULIA	How long since you were here?
L274534	u1308	m87	LARRY	It's just been empty a while.
L274533	u1306	m87	JULIA	It smells damp.
L274529	u1308	m87	LARRY	Ah!
L274528	u1306	m87	JULIA	Just a thought --
L274527	u1308	m87	LARRY	Like who?
L274526	u1306	m87	JULIA	Maybe somebody changed the lock.
L274525	u1308	m87	LARRY	O.K. O.K.
L274524	u1306	m87	JULIA	We're going to freeze to death.
L274523	u1308	m87	LARRY	It's ONE of these.
L274896	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
L274895	u1306	m87	JULIA	What's wrong?
L274894	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Oh Christ.
L274893	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
L274892	u1306	m87	JULIA	Am I?
L274891	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	You know, you're very beautiful.
L274890	u1306	m87	JULIA	Maybe I will.
L274889	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Why don't you do the same?
L274888	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Yeah, why don't I?
L274887	u1306	m87	JULIA	Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
L274886	u1306	m87	JULIA	That's right.
L274885	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	First time for everything.
L274884	u1306	m87	JULIA	I prefer the floor.
L274883	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	I suppose not.
L274882	u1306	m87	JULIA	We don't need a bed, do we?
L274881	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	What's going on?
L274880	u1306	m87	JULIA	No.
L274879	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	This isn't the bedroom.
L274878	u1306	m87	JULIA	That's right.
L274877	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	No personal details?
L274876	u1306	m87	JULIA	Let's keep it that way, shall we?
L274875	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	No, not much.
L274874	u1306	m87	JULIA	Do you care ?
L274873	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Is this your place ?
L274872	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	That's more like it.
L274871	u1306	m87	JULIA	No. No. Let's go upstairs.
L274870	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
L274869	u1306	m87	JULIA	I... suppose so, yes.
L274868	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Well, isn't it?
L274866	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
L274865	u1306	m87	JULIA	You want something to drink?
L274864	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	I suppose that's right.
L274863	u1306	m87	JULIA	There's a first time for everything.
L274862	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	You know it's not often I... you know...
L274861	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Oh?
L274860	u1306	m87	JULIA	That depends.
L274859	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
L274858	u1306	m87	JULIA	Please.
L274857	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Plain soda?
L274856	u1306	m87	JULIA	Just soda.
L274855	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	What are you drinking?
L274852	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	I wonder, maybe...
L274851	u1306	m87	JULIA	Not much.
L274850	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Drinking alone.
L274849	u1306	m87	JULIA	What?
L274848	u1310	m87	PRUDHOE	Not much fun, is it?
L275144	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Steve.
L275143	u1309	m87	NURSE	Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
L275142	u1309	m87	NURSE	Try me.
L275141	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	You wouldn't believe me.
L275140	u1309	m87	NURSE	Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
L275139	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
L275138	u1309	m87	NURSE	I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
L275137	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
L275136	u1309	m87	NURSE	What a pretty tune.
L275108	u1309	m87	NURSE	I won't be a moment.
L275107	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Who brought me in here?
L275106	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Wait a moment --
L275105	u1309	m87	NURSE	I'll get the doctor.
L275104	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	What happened to me?
L275103	u1309	m87	NURSE	You're awake. Good girl.
L275251	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I have to get out.
L275250	u1308	m87	LARRY	Where are you going?
L275249	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
L275248	u1308	m87	LARRY	No. It's all over.
L275247	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	PLEASE. You're in danger.
L275246	u1308	m87	LARRY	What's the problem?
L275245	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Get the fuck out of here.
L275240	u1308	m87	LARRY	Show her.
L275239	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Yes!
L275238	u1308	m87	LARRY	No you don't.
L275237	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I want to see.
L275236	u1308	m87	LARRY	I'm afraid it's true.
L275235	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I don't believe it.
L275234	u1308	m87	LARRY	Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
L275229	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Gone?
L275228	u1308	m87	LARRY	He's gone.
L275227	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Finished?
L275226	u1308	m87	LARRY	Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
L275225	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
L275224	u1308	m87	LARRY	It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
L275223	u1308	m87	LARRY	Of course.
L275222	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I have to talk to you.
L275055	u1308	m87	LARRY	Maybe all she needs is some company.
L275054	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Sure.
L275053	u1308	m87	LARRY	Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
L275052	u1308	m87	LARRY	I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
L275051	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	What?
L275050	u1308	m87	LARRY	It's like she's waiting for something.
L275049	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Really?
L275048	u1308	m87	LARRY	She doesn't even want to leave the house.
L275045	u1308	m87	LARRY	You don't like her at all do you?
L275044	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
L275043	u1308	m87	LARRY	I guess.
L275042	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Maybe you should give it some time.
L275041	u1308	m87	LARRY	...maybe we should never have come back.
L274956	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I love you too.
L274955	u1308	m87	LARRY	I love you, honey.
L274954	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Yeah.
L274953	u1308	m87	LARRY	Never better. You sleep well.
L274952	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
L274747	u1308	m87	LARRY	Steve?
L274746	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I've forgotten.
L274745	u1308	m87	LARRY	What are you drinking, love?
L274651	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Sure.
L274650	u1308	m87	LARRY	Are you O.K.?
L274638	u1308	m87	LARRY	Kitchen's through on your left.
L274637	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
L274636	u1308	m87	LARRY	Kirsty.
L274635	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Surprise.
L274634	u1308	m87	LARRY	Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
L274633	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Is Julia here?
L274632	u1308	m87	LARRY	I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
L274631	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Me like.
L274630	u1308	m87	LARRY	You like?
L274629	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Big house.
L274603	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I will. See you.
L274602	u1308	m87	LARRY	Call me tomorrow.
L274601	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Take care, Dad.
L274600	u1308	m87	LARRY	O.K.
L274599	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Of course. Every day.
L274598	u1308	m87	LARRY	You will keep in touch.
L274597	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
L274596	u1308	m87	LARRY	I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
L274595	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
L274594	u1308	m87	LARRY	What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
L274593	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
L274592	u1308	m87	LARRY	Well come over, will you? See the place?
L274591	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Great.
L274590	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
L274589	u1308	m87	LARRY	Well I want you to see the house.
L274588	u1308	m87	LARRY	Do you want me to come over?
L274587	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	YOU'D like my room.
L274586	u1308	m87	LARRY	You'd like the house.
L274585	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No Dad.
L274584	u1308	m87	LARRY	I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
L274583	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I said: I found a room.
L274582	u1308	m87	LARRY	What did you say?
L274581	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I found a room.
L274580	u1308	m87	LARRY	Where are you?
L274579	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I got through.
L274578	u1308	m87	LARRY	Kirsty?
L274577	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Daddy?
L274576	u1308	m87	LARRY	Who's there?
L275179	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	'Bye.
L275178	u1311	m87	STEVE	'Bye.
L275177	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Sure. Why not?
L275176	u1311	m87	STEVE	I'll come back later, huh?
L275175	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Will you GO, damn you?
L275174	u1311	m87	STEVE	What did I say?
L275173	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
L275172	u1311	m87	STEVE	What?
L275169	u1311	m87	STEVE	I won't let anybody take you.
L275168	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Don't let them take me, Steve --
L275167	u1311	m87	STEVE	What's wrong?
L275164	u1311	m87	STEVE	What things?
L275163	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	These THINGS... they want to take me --
L275162	u1311	m87	STEVE	What happened to you?
L275161	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Steve. Thank God you came.
L274847	u1311	m87	STEVE	It's a fetish of mine.
L274846	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
L274845	u1311	m87	STEVE	Can I lend you a hand?
L274844	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Just trying to get my apartment in order.
L274843	u1311	m87	STEVE	Are you busy after work ?
L274842	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	No, it's good to see you.
L274841	u1311	m87	STEVE	I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
L274840	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	If I make it through the day.
L274839	u1311	m87	STEVE	Your father told me you were working here.
L274838	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I've been better.
L274837	u1311	m87	STEVE	Are you alright ?
L274836	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Oh!
L274820	u1311	m87	STEVE	Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
L274819	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	It's not what I heard.
L274818	u1311	m87	STEVE	Oh no.
L274817	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Oh no?
L274816	u1311	m87	STEVE	We're not all frigid.

L274808	u1311	m87	STEVE	Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
L274807	u1311	m87	STEVE	We walk.
L274806	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	What do we do if there isn't?
L274805	u1311	m87	STEVE	If there's a train.
L274804	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	All right.  No. That's nice.
L274803	u1311	m87	STEVE	Please. I want to see you home. All right?
L274802	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	Not that late.
L274801	u1311	m87	STEVE	It's late.
L274800	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	You know I do know the way home.
L274799	u1307	m87	KIRSTY	I'm coming!  Sleep well.

L274748	u1311	m87	STEVE	We're on the Cointreau.
L290853	u1388	m92	BABY	Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
L290852	u1394	m92	JERRY	Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
L290352	u1388	m92	BABY	Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
L290351	u1394	m92	JERRY	I agree.
L290299	u1388	m92	BABY	Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
L290298	u1394	m92	JERRY	The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
L290274	u1394	m92	JERRY	Cool.
L290273	u1388	m92	BABY	Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
L290269	u1388	m92	BABY	I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
L290268	u1394	m92	JERRY	I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
L290267	u1388	m92	BABY	Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
L290266	u1394	m92	JERRY	Huh... what cone?
L290265	u1388	m92	BABY	Cone.
L290264	u1394	m92	JERRY	What?
L290263	u1388	m92	BABY	Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
L290262	u1394	m92	JERRY	Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
L290261	u1388	m92	BABY	Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
L290260	u1394	m92	JERRY	Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
L290259	u1388	m92	BABY	Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
L290250	u1388	m92	BABY	Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
L290249	u1394	m92	JERRY	Yikes.
L290248	u1388	m92	BABY	Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
L290247	u1394	m92	JERRY	Really, that's a long time.
L290246	u1388	m92	BABY	Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
L290851	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
L290850	u1388	m92	BABY	Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
L290832	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Who's your Daddy!
L290831	u1388	m92	BABY	Who's your Daddy!
L290819	u1388	m92	BABY	Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
L290818	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
L290817	u1388	m92	BABY	Drink up, it's party time.
L290606	u1396	m92	MOTHER	No, I told you...
L290605	u1388	m92	BABY	Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
L290604	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Baby! Stop!
L290603	u1388	m92	BABY	I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
L290510	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
L290509	u1388	m92	BABY	Ma, Tiny's in.
L290484	u1388	m92	BABY	Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
L290483	u1396	m92	MOTHER	What about R.J.?
L290482	u1388	m92	BABY	Tiny's home.
L290447	u1388	m92	BABY	Whoopie fucking doo.
L290446	u1389	m92	BILL	Hey, great they're back.
L290445	u1388	m92	BABY	OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
L290444	u1389	m92	BILL	That's not something to joke about.
L290443	u1388	m92	BABY	Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
L290442	u1389	m92	BILL	What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
L290441	u1388	m92	BABY	Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
L290440	u1389	m92	BILL	I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
L290439	u1388	m92	BABY	Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
L290438	u1389	m92	BILL	Mmmmm, this is tasty.
L290437	u1388	m92	BABY	A dead one.
L290436	u1389	m92	BILL	Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
L290435	u1388	m92	BABY	You're welcome.
L290434	u1389	m92	BILL	Thank you.
L290433	u1388	m92	BABY	You sure do a lot of guessing.
L290432	u1389	m92	BILL	Um, yeah sure, I guess.
L290431	u1388	m92	BABY	No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
L290430	u1389	m92	BILL	So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
L290405	u1388	m92	BABY	Yeah, come on.
L290404	u1389	m92	BILL	He left!
L290403	u1388	m92	BABY	Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
L290402	u1389	m92	BILL	Is your brother ready to go?
L290401	u1388	m92	BABY	Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
L290400	u1389	m92	BILL	Christ, you scared the shit out of me.

L290369	u1389	m92	BILL	Well, yeah, kind of.
L290368	u1388	m92	BABY	Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
L290367	u1389	m92	BILL	How much further?
L290354	u1388	m92	BABY	Come on.
L290353	u1389	m92	BILL	Don't worry, I'll be right back.
L290345	u1388	m92	BABY	OK.

L290331	u1388	m92	BABY	If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
L290330	u1389	m92	BILL	I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
L290276	u1388	m92	BABY	Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
L290275	u1389	m92	BILL	Which way?
L290271	u1388	m92	BABY	Oh yeah, the tree.
L290270	u1389	m92	BILL	What about the tree?
L290257	u1388	m92	BABY	Couple more miles up this road.
L290256	u1389	m92	BILL	Where's that?
L290255	u1388	m92	BABY	Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
L290602	u1388	m92	BABY	Yeah, I'll do something.

L290493	u1388	m92	BABY	He walks, duh.
L290329	u1395	m92	MARY	Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
L290328	u1388	m92	BABY	I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
L290327	u1395	m92	MARY	What the hell are you laughing about?
L290320	u1388	m92	BABY	I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.

L290290	u1395	m92	MARY	The animals have got nothing to do with it.
L290289	u1388	m92	BABY	No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.

L290690	u1391	m92	CASHIER	You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
L290689	u1388	m92	BABY	Now, what makes you think that?
L290688	u1391	m92	CASHIER	You all having a Halloween party tonight?
L290160	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
L290159	u1389	m92	BILL	No, no I think it's really interesting.
L290158	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
L290157	u1389	m92	BILL	But suppose for a second you did.
L290156	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	I don't.
L290155	u1389	m92	BILL	But if you did.
L290154	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	I don't drive cross country.
L290153	u1389	m92	BILL	You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
L290152	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
L290151	u1389	m92	BILL	Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
L290150	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
L290149	u1389	m92	BILL	You mean John Wayne?
L290148	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
L290147	u1389	m92	BILL	The Duke?
L290146	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
L290145	u1389	m92	BILL	No, really.
L290144	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
L290143	u1389	m92	BILL	How long have you been running this place?
L290614	u1394	m92	JERRY	Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
L290613	u1389	m92	BILL	Almost there.
L290573	u1394	m92	JERRY	I know, this is fucking nuts.
L290572	u1389	m92	BILL	I can't believe what I'm seeing.
L290529	u1394	m92	JERRY	Tasted pretty good.
L290528	u1389	m92	BILL	Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
L290527	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
L290526	u1389	m92	BILL	Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
L290525	u1394	m92	JERRY	Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
L290357	u1394	m92	JERRY	No problem.
L290356	u1389	m92	BILL	Thanks.
L290355	u1394	m92	JERRY	Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
L290325	u1389	m92	BILL	And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
L290324	u1394	m92	JERRY	Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
L290312	u1389	m92	BILL	You're a real fucking piece of work.
L290311	u1394	m92	JERRY	Well, technically I did what ya said.
L290310	u1389	m92	BILL	Jesus Christ, Jerry.
L290309	u1394	m92	JERRY	Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
L290308	u1389	m92	BILL	I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
L290307	u1389	m92	BILL	Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
L290306	u1394	m92	JERRY	I'll help ya.
L290305	u1389	m92	BILL	OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
L290301	u1389	m92	BILL	Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
L290300	u1394	m92	JERRY	What was that?
L290295	u1394	m92	JERRY	No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
L290294	u1389	m92	BILL	Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
L290293	u1394	m92	JERRY	That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
L290244	u1394	m92	JERRY	Cat fight, cat fight.
L290243	u1389	m92	BILL	She looks like she stinks.
L290233	u1389	m92	BILL	Way out here?
L290232	u1394	m92	JERRY	It's a hitchhiker.
L290231	u1389	m92	BILL	What's that?
L290230	u1394	m92	JERRY	Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
L290227	u1389	m92	BILL	I don't know.
L290226	u1394	m92	JERRY	I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
L290225	u1389	m92	BILL	How much further?
L290224	u1394	m92	JERRY	Keep straight on this road here.
L290127	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hell yeah.
L290126	u1389	m92	BILL	Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
L290125	u1394	m92	JERRY	Really fucking awesome.
L290124	u1389	m92	BILL	How awesome?
L290123	u1394	m92	JERRY	Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
L290122	u1394	m92	JERRY	OK, Boss.
L290121	u1389	m92	BILL	I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
L290120	u1394	m92	JERRY	I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
L290119	u1389	m92	BILL	Perfect.
L290118	u1394	m92	JERRY	Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
L290117	u1389	m92	BILL	I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
L290116	u1394	m92	JERRY	"Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, ""Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."""
L290115	u1389	m92	BILL	Oh yeah, I remember now.
L290114	u1394	m92	JERRY	"Then the devil says, ""are you gay?"" Guy says, ""fuck no""... Devil says, ""Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."""
L290113	u1389	m92	BILL	Yeah.
L290112	u1394	m92	JERRY	"Then the devil asks, ""do you drink?"" Guy says, ""yeah""... devil say, ""wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."""
L290111	u1389	m92	BILL	Shit, we really need to find some gas.
L290110	u1394	m92	JERRY	"So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, ""do you smoke?"" The guy say, ""yeah""... the devil say, ""great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."""
L290109	u1389	m92	BILL	Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
L290108	u1389	m92	BILL	Hot has got nothing to do with it.
L290107	u1394	m92	JERRY	Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
L290106	u1389	m92	BILL	Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
L290105	u1394	m92	JERRY	I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
L290104	u1389	m92	BILL	I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
L290103	u1394	m92	JERRY	Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
L290102	u1389	m92	BILL	Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
L290101	u1394	m92	JERRY	As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
L290100	u1389	m92	BILL	Yeah, no shit.
L290099	u1394	m92	JERRY	If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
L290098	u1389	m92	BILL	Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
L290097	u1394	m92	JERRY	There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
L290096	u1389	m92	BILL	Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
L290095	u1394	m92	JERRY	She's pretty cute.
L290094	u1389	m92	BILL	Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
L290093	u1394	m92	JERRY	Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
L290612	u1392	m92	DENISE	Lock the fucking doors.
L290611	u1389	m92	BILL	Don't look back, just get in the car.
L290592	u1392	m92	DENISE	I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
L290591	u1389	m92	BILL	Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
L290588	u1389	m92	BILL	Man, it's already ten thirty.
L290587	u1392	m92	DENISE	Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
L290569	u1392	m92	DENISE	That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
L290568	u1389	m92	BILL	Just grin and bear it.
L290559	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah, showtime for what?
L290558	u1389	m92	BILL	What's he so excited about?
L290465	u1392	m92	DENISE	I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
L290464	u1389	m92	BILL	Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
L290339	u1392	m92	DENISE	Turn that fucking radio off!
L290338	u1389	m92	BILL	Fuck! We are fucked!
L290285	u1389	m92	BILL	He won't move.
L290284	u1392	m92	DENISE	Honk at him. Scare him.
L290213	u1392	m92	DENISE	Here he comes.
L290212	u1389	m92	BILL	I like sleep.
L290621	u1389	m92	BILL	It won't work.
L290620	u1395	m92	MARY	Drive through it!
L290619	u1389	m92	BILL	I gotta open the gate.
L290618	u1395	m92	MARY	What are you doing!
L290598	u1395	m92	MARY	Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
L290597	u1389	m92	BILL	Quiet.
L290596	u1395	m92	MARY	How much is a person supposed to stand?
L290575	u1389	m92	BILL	Just sit back and enjoy the show.
L290574	u1395	m92	MARY	This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
L290571	u1389	m92	BILL	Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
L290570	u1395	m92	MARY	Check this out.
L290503	u1389	m92	BILL	Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
L290502	u1395	m92	MARY	I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
L290350	u1389	m92	BILL	Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
L290349	u1395	m92	MARY	Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
L290348	u1389	m92	BILL	Forget it. I'll just go.
L290337	u1389	m92	BILL	Fine! I'll go straight!
L290336	u1395	m92	MARY	What!
L290335	u1389	m92	BILL	Fine. I'll go straight.
L290323	u1395	m92	MARY	What?
L290322	u1389	m92	BILL	Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
L290292	u1395	m92	MARY	Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
L290291	u1389	m92	BILL	Hey, he moved.
L290288	u1395	m92	MARY	Then run him over, he'll move.
L290287	u1389	m92	BILL	There's not enough room.
L290286	u1395	m92	MARY	Go around him.
L290283	u1389	m92	BILL	There's a dog in the road.
L290282	u1395	m92	MARY	Why are we stopping?
L290254	u1389	m92	BILL	Where ya headed?
L290253	u1395	m92	MARY	Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
L290240	u1395	m92	MARY	She looks like a freak.
L290239	u1389	m92	BILL	We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
L290238	u1395	m92	MARY	Should we stop?
L290235	u1389	m92	BILL	It's a girl.
L290234	u1395	m92	MARY	Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
L290184	u1395	m92	MARY	Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
L290183	u1389	m92	BILL	We'll need pictures of the inside too.
L290672	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Enough talk, write.
L290671	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
L290670	u1401	m92	WYDELL	How's about you give me those same directions.
L290669	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
L290668	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Is that all... think real hard.
L290667	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
L290666	u1401	m92	WYDELL	And...
L290663	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
L290662	u1401	m92	WYDELL	What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
L290661	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Hmmmmmmmmm?
L290660	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Come on, get with the facts.
L290657	u1401	m92	WYDELL	You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
L290656	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
L290655	u1401	m92	WYDELL	What I need are some answers. 
L290654	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
L290086	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
L290085	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Fuck your grandmother.
L290065	u1400	m92	STUCKY	I hear ya.
L290064	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
L290062	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
L290061	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
L290060	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
L290059	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
L290058	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
L290057	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Goddamn.
L290056	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
L290055	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
L290054	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
L290053	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	What?
L290052	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
L290051	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
L290050	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
L290049	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
L290048	u1400	m92	STUCKY	That kid is one horny retard.
L290047	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Fascinating.
L290046	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
L290045	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
L290044	u1400	m92	STUCKY	Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
L290043	u1390	m92	CAPT. SPAULDING	Hmmmmm.
L290042	u1400	m92	STUCKY	I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
L290516	u1396	m92	MOTHER	He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
L290515	u1392	m92	DENISE	What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
L290514	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
L290513	u1392	m92	DENISE	Oh.
L290512	u1396	m92	MOTHER	You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
L290508	u1396	m92	MOTHER	No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
L290507	u1392	m92	DENISE	You sure you don't need any help in there?
L290492	u1392	m92	DENISE	How's he get around out here?
L290491	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
L290488	u1396	m92	MOTHER	He should be back in a couple hours.
L290487	u1392	m92	DENISE	How long is that gonna take?
L290475	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
L290474	u1396	m92	MOTHER	That's nice.
L290473	u1392	m92	DENISE	No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
L290458	u1396	m92	MOTHER	No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
L290457	u1392	m92	DENISE	Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
L290882	u1392	m92	DENISE	Help, help us.
L290881	u1394	m92	JERRY	Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
L290880	u1392	m92	DENISE	That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
L290879	u1394	m92	JERRY	That was good babe, just keep doing that.
L290878	u1394	m92	JERRY	I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
L290877	u1392	m92	DENISE	I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
L290876	u1394	m92	JERRY	Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
L290875	u1392	m92	DENISE	We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
L290595	u1394	m92	JERRY	Shhhhhh.
L290594	u1392	m92	DENISE	You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
L290581	u1392	m92	DENISE	This isn't funny, it's twisted.
L290580	u1394	m92	JERRY	I don't know, I think he's funny.
L290579	u1392	m92	DENISE	What are you laughing at?
L290506	u1392	m92	DENISE	Shhhhhh.
L290505	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
L290504	u1392	m92	DENISE	Really, now is not the time to make waves.
L290499	u1394	m92	JERRY	Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
L290498	u1392	m92	DENISE	Thank you.
L290451	u1394	m92	JERRY	Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
L290450	u1392	m92	DENISE	Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
L290449	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
L290393	u1392	m92	DENISE	When you were outside with Bill.
L290392	u1394	m92	JERRY	When?
L290391	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
L290385	u1394	m92	JERRY	I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
L290384	u1392	m92	DENISE	You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
L290383	u1394	m92	JERRY	I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
L290382	u1392	m92	DENISE	So what?
L290381	u1394	m92	JERRY	These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
L290380	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah?
L290379	u1394	m92	JERRY	"Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, ""criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."""
L290378	u1392	m92	DENISE	Why?
L290377	u1394	m92	JERRY	Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
L290376	u1392	m92	DENISE	So.
L290375	u1394	m92	JERRY	"It says, ""records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."""
L290374	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
L290373	u1394	m92	JERRY	Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
L290372	u1392	m92	DENISE	Oh, yeah.
L290371	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
L290370	u1392	m92	DENISE	Fuck, it's freezing.
L290237	u1392	m92	DENISE	That seems likely.
L290236	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
L290217	u1394	m92	JERRY	Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
L290216	u1392	m92	DENISE	Ugh, what's that smell?
L290182	u1392	m92	DENISE	Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
L290181	u1394	m92	JERRY	Aw, come on. It will be fun.
L290179	u1392	m92	DENISE	I don't want to see that.
L290178	u1394	m92	JERRY	This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
L290177	u1392	m92	DENISE	Tickets for what?
L290176	u1394	m92	JERRY	Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
L290131	u1394	m92	JERRY	Grab Mary and come inside.
L290130	u1392	m92	DENISE	Huh?
L290201	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
L290200	u1392	m92	DENISE	Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
L290199	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
L290198	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
L290197	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
L290196	u1392	m92	DENISE	No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
L290195	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
L290524	u1395	m92	MARY	Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
L290523	u1392	m92	DENISE	Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
L290490	u1392	m92	DENISE	Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
L290489	u1395	m92	MARY	A couple hours!
L290455	u1395	m92	MARY	Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
L290454	u1392	m92	DENISE	Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
L290422	u1395	m92	MARY	I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
L290421	u1392	m92	DENISE	Jesus Christ.
L290415	u1392	m92	DENISE	Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
L290414	u1395	m92	MARY	I still don't.
L290413	u1392	m92	DENISE	Shhhhhh, quiet.
L290412	u1395	m92	MARY	I don't hear anything.
L290410	u1395	m92	MARY	Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
L290409	u1392	m92	DENISE	What? I didn't hear anything.
L290408	u1395	m92	MARY	What was that?
L290407	u1392	m92	DENISE	I don't know... about half an hour.
L290406	u1395	m92	MARY	How long has it been?
L290395	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah, she said we looked queer.
L290394	u1395	m92	MARY	She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
L290343	u1392	m92	DENISE	I can't believe...
L290342	u1395	m92	MARY	I think I'm going fucking crazy.
L290304	u1395	m92	MARY	God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
L290303	u1392	m92	DENISE	You got to be fucking joking.
L290302	u1395	m92	MARY	Don't even say it.
L290242	u1395	m92	MARY	She looks like she stinks.
L290241	u1392	m92	DENISE	Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
L290229	u1392	m92	DENISE	Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
L290228	u1395	m92	MARY	Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
L290211	u1395	m92	MARY	Maybe he's a cyborg.
L290210	u1392	m92	DENISE	Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
L290209	u1395	m92	MARY	Geez, he never gets tired does he.
L290175	u1395	m92	MARY	Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
L290174	u1392	m92	DENISE	Scattered, smothered and covered.
L290173	u1395	m92	MARY	If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
L290172	u1392	m92	DENISE	A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
L290171	u1395	m92	MARY	I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
L290170	u1392	m92	DENISE	Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
L290169	u1395	m92	MARY	It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
L290167	u1395	m92	MARY	Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
L290166	u1392	m92	DENISE	God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
L290165	u1395	m92	MARY	Tell me about it.
L290164	u1392	m92	DENISE	I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
L290141	u1395	m92	MARY	Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
L290140	u1392	m92	DENISE	Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
L290139	u1395	m92	MARY	Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
L290138	u1392	m92	DENISE	Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
L290137	u1395	m92	MARY	I resign.
L290136	u1392	m92	DENISE	Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
L290135	u1395	m92	MARY	No please, let me sit this one out.
L290134	u1392	m92	DENISE	Rise and shine.
L290133	u1395	m92	MARY	Sleeping.
L290132	u1392	m92	DENISE	Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
L290726	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Yep, I found something.
L290725	u1393	m92	HUSTON	You find something, Georgie?
L290724	u1401	m92	WYDELL	God damn.
L290715	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Yep, I suppose it is.
L290714	u1393	m92	HUSTON	That's the understatement of the year.
L290713	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
L290712	u1393	m92	HUSTON	Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
L290711	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Not yet.
L290710	u1393	m92	HUSTON	Recover any bodies?
L290709	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Yeah, no mercy here.
L290708	u1393	m92	HUSTON	Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
L290707	u1401	m92	WYDELL	A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
L290706	u1393	m92	HUSTON	What'd we here, Georgie?
L290722	u1398	m92	NAISH	Yes, sir.
L290721	u1393	m92	HUSTON	Open up the trunk.
L290720	u1398	m92	NAISH	Huh?
L290719	u1393	m92	HUSTON	Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
L290718	u1398	m92	NAISH	Keys.
L290717	u1393	m92	HUSTON	What'd ya got there?
L290861	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
L290860	u1394	m92	JERRY	Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
L290859	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
L290563	u1394	m92	JERRY	Great.
L290562	u1396	m92	MOTHER	No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
L290561	u1394	m92	JERRY	Oh, you mean on TV.
L290560	u1396	m92	MOTHER	For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
L290540	u1394	m92	JERRY	Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
L290539	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Firefly.
L290538	u1394	m92	JERRY	I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
L290521	u1394	m92	JERRY	Didn't ya think, Mary?
L290520	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
L290519	u1394	m92	JERRY	Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
L290478	u1394	m92	JERRY	I was just kidding.
L290477	u1396	m92	MOTHER	I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
L290476	u1394	m92	JERRY	And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
L290472	u1394	m92	JERRY	I don't doubt that.
L290471	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
L290470	u1394	m92	JERRY	Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
L290469	u1396	m92	MOTHER	So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
L290463	u1394	m92	JERRY	Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
L290462	u1396	m92	MOTHER	What do they call you, sweety?
L290461	u1394	m92	JERRY	Oh, right.
L290460	u1396	m92	MOTHER	His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
L290459	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
L290590	u1394	m92	JERRY	Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
L290589	u1395	m92	MARY	I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
L290567	u1395	m92	MARY	I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
L290566	u1394	m92	JERRY	This is way too fucked up for words.
L290424	u1395	m92	MARY	Enough with the stupid voices.
L290423	u1394	m92	JERRY	OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
L290420	u1395	m92	MARY	What!
L290419	u1394	m92	JERRY	Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
L290390	u1395	m92	MARY	You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
L290389	u1394	m92	JERRY	Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
L290388	u1395	m92	MARY	That stupid hillbilly slut.
L290387	u1394	m92	JERRY	Huh?
L290386	u1395	m92	MARY	God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
L290347	u1395	m92	MARY	You said it, not me.
L290346	u1394	m92	JERRY	I'll go. It's my fault.
L290333	u1394	m92	JERRY	I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
L290332	u1395	m92	MARY	Just back up.
L290215	u1395	m92	MARY	Huh?
L290214	u1394	m92	JERRY	We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
L290204	u1394	m92	JERRY	Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
L290203	u1395	m92	MARY	Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
L290202	u1394	m92	JERRY	I'm gonna go ask him.
L290610	u1395	m92	MARY	Don't worry, I'm gone.
L290609	u1396	m92	MOTHER	I suggest you kids leave now.
L290497	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
L290496	u1395	m92	MARY	Sorry.
L290495	u1396	m92	MOTHER	I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
L290481	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
L290480	u1395	m92	MARY	No, just a little too old.
L290479	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
L290648	u1399	m92	OTIS	You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
L290647	u1395	m92	MARY	What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
L290646	u1399	m92	OTIS	Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
L290645	u1395	m92	MARY	Fuck you, you fucking freak!
L290644	u1399	m92	OTIS	Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
L290643	u1395	m92	MARY	This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
L290642	u1399	m92	OTIS	Behold... The Fish-Boy!
L290640	u1399	m92	OTIS	Let's go see.
L290639	u1395	m92	MARY	Where is he?
L290638	u1399	m92	OTIS	Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
L290637	u1395	m92	MARY	Where's Bill?
L290636	u1399	m92	OTIS	Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
L290635	u1395	m92	MARY	Why? Why are you doing this?
L290802	u1396	m92	MOTHER	No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
L290801	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
L290798	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
L290797	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Thank you.
L290796	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
L290795	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Please, just a minute.
L290794	u1396	m92	MOTHER	I um... no, I don't think so...
L290793	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
L290792	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
L290791	u1401	m92	WYDELL	I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
L290790	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
L290789	u1401	m92	WYDELL	My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
L290788	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
L290787	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
L290786	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Well hello, officer.
L290869	u1399	m92	OTIS	Well, go get her.
L290868	u1396	m92	MOTHER	That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
L290858	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Wait, I want to say good-bye.
L290857	u1399	m92	OTIS	Get in... now!
L290830	u1399	m92	OTIS	Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
L290829	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Who's your Daddy!
L290828	u1399	m92	OTIS	I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
L290776	u1399	m92	OTIS	Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
L290775	u1396	m92	MOTHER	What should I do?
L290774	u1399	m92	OTIS	I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
L290773	u1396	m92	MOTHER	I don't know. I only saw one.
L290770	u1399	m92	OTIS	What! God damn, how many?
L290769	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
L290552	u1399	m92	OTIS	I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
L290551	u1396	m92	MOTHER	Grampa... watch the language.
L290809	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Right.
L290808	u1398	m92	NAISH	Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
L290800	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Call Wydell.
L290799	u1398	m92	NAISH	Jesus Christ.
L290785	u1398	m92	NAISH	Shit... fuck procedure.
L290784	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Tell it to my daughter.
L290783	u1398	m92	NAISH	I ain't got a warrant.
L290782	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	We gotta break it open.
L290780	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Over here, inside the smokehouse.
L290779	u1398	m92	NAISH	Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
L290778	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Shhhh... you hear that?
L290777	u1398	m92	NAISH	Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
L290765	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Where we headed?
L290764	u1398	m92	NAISH	Turn up this road.
L290761	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
L290760	u1398	m92	NAISH	No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
L290759	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
L290750	u1398	m92	NAISH	No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
L290749	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Fit the profile?
L290748	u1398	m92	NAISH	Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
L290739	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	George Willis...  ...any leads?
L290738	u1398	m92	NAISH	Hey.
L290763	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	I pray to God there is.
L290762	u1401	m92	WYDELL	I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
L290752	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
L290751	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
L290747	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
L290746	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	What about the body you found?
L290743	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Dr. Satan?
L290742	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
L290741	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	That's it?
L290740	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
L290737	u1401	m92	WYDELL	I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
L290736	u1397	m92	MR. WILLIS	Yes, sir.
L290735	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Mr. Willis?
L290806	u1398	m92	NAISH	We found one.
L290805	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Over.
L290804	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Excuse me for a second.
L290803	u1398	m92	NAISH	Wydell.
L290768	u1398	m92	NAISH	Right...  ...come on.
L290767	u1401	m92	WYDELL	I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
L290754	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
L290753	u1398	m92	NAISH	Don't worry, we'll find her.
L290745	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
L290744	u1398	m92	NAISH	Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
L290734	u1401	m92	WYDELL	That must be him.
L290733	u1398	m92	NAISH	I guess not.
L290732	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
L290731	u1398	m92	NAISH	Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
L290730	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
L290729	u1398	m92	NAISH	You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
L290687	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Call the chief... We found 'em.
L290686	u1398	m92	NAISH	Plates match.
L290685	u1398	m92	NAISH	What.
L290684	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Aw, fuck.
L290683	u1398	m92	NAISH	Hulk was dumb as shit.
L290682	u1401	m92	WYDELL	I always favored the Hulk.
L290681	u1398	m92	NAISH	You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
L290680	u1401	m92	WYDELL	How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
L290679	u1398	m92	NAISH	You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
L290678	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
L290677	u1398	m92	NAISH	Your Spidey senses tingling.
L290676	u1401	m92	WYDELL	I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
L290675	u1398	m92	NAISH	Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
L290651	u1398	m92	NAISH	Right.
L290650	u1401	m92	WYDELL	Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
L307676	u1427	m96	DAD	Better now, son?
L307675	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I was so scared.
L307674	u1427	m96	DAD	I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
L307670	u1427	m96	DAD	It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
L307669	u1429	m96	JIMMY	It was so real, Dad.
L307668	u1427	m96	DAD	That's a doozy of a dream, son.
L307667	u1429	m96	JIMMY	... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
L307664	u1429	m96	JIMMY	First lemme look at your necks.
L307663	u1427	m96	DAD	What, Jim, what?
L307662	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I had an awful dream.
L307298	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Was there anything over the hill?
L307297	u1427	m96	DAD	I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
L307294	u1427	m96	DAD	Sure ... fine.
L307293	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Are you all right, Dad?
L307288	u1427	m96	DAD	I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
L307287	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
L307286	u1427	m96	DAD	Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
L307285	u1429	m96	JIMMY	It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
L307284	u1427	m96	DAD	What did it look like?
L307283	u1429	m96	JIMMY	It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
L307282	u1429	m96	JIMMY	You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
L307281	u1427	m96	DAD	Jim -- what's wrong?!
L307277	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Okay.
L307276	u1427	m96	DAD	Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
L307271	u1427	m96	DAD	That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
L307270	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
L307268	u1427	m96	DAD	And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
L307267	u1429	m96	JIMMY	... and Rigel.
L307266	u1429	m96	JIMMY	There's Cassius ...
L307265	u1427	m96	DAD	This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
L307264	u1429	m96	JIMMY	There are more this year than last.
L307244	u1427	m96	DAD	Because the sky is so clear out here.
L307243	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Why, Dad?
L307242	u1427	m96	DAD	It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
L307241	u1429	m96	JIMMY	A meteorite, Dad, look!
L307236	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
L307235	u1427	m96	DAD	It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
L307234	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
L307233	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Let's check it out, Dad.
L307232	u1427	m96	DAD	If we want it, it is.
L307231	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Is the hill ours too?
L307230	u1427	m96	DAD	This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
L307229	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Wow.  Look at the mountains.
L307221	u1427	m96	DAD	That's the Air Force Base.
L307220	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What's that, Dad?
L307218	u1427	m96	DAD	You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
L307217	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
L307216	u1427	m96	DAD	I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
L307215	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Do we have to?
L307214	u1427	m96	DAD	We're going to be moving, son.
L307213	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Yes.
L307212	u1427	m96	DAD	Son ... are you awake?
L307678	u1431	m96	MOM	Good night.
L307677	u1427	m96	DAD	Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
L307384	u1431	m96	MOM	It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
L307383	u1427	m96	DAD	What's wrong, Ellen?
L307377	u1431	m96	MOM	George, you're acting very strangely.
L307376	u1427	m96	DAD	You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
L307374	u1431	m96	MOM	Yes -- but ...
L307373	u1427	m96	DAD	I'm home now.
L307371	u1431	m96	MOM	You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
L307370	u1427	m96	DAD	I left it at work.
L307369	u1431	m96	MOM	Where's your car?
L307368	u1427	m96	DAD	That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
L307367	u1431	m96	MOM	What happened to you?  Who was that?
L307313	u1431	m96	MOM	I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
L307312	u1427	m96	DAD	It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
L307308	u1431	m96	MOM	You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
L307307	u1427	m96	DAD	I'll take you to school.
L307306	u1431	m96	MOM	I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
L307451	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why, yes.  Why?
L307450	u1427	m96	DAD	Is that all he said?
L307449	u1430	m96	LINDA	He was upset with moving, I believe.
L307448	u1427	m96	DAD	What did he talk to you about?
L307447	u1430	m96	LINDA	I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
L307446	u1427	m96	DAD	What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
L307437	u1430	m96	LINDA	Yes, Mr. Gardner.
L307436	u1427	m96	DAD	We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
L307435	u1430	m96	LINDA	Of course.
L307434	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
L307433	u1430	m96	LINDA	Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
L307432	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
L307431	u1430	m96	LINDA	Mr. Gardner, I --
L307430	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
L307429	u1430	m96	LINDA	Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
L307428	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	About what?
L307427	u1430	m96	LINDA	We were having a little talk.
L307426	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	May I ask why?
L307425	u1430	m96	LINDA	Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
L307424	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
L307423	u1430	m96	LINDA	Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
L307534	u1429	m96	JIMMY	They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
L307533	u1430	m96	LINDA	You're looking for life?
L307506	u1430	m96	LINDA	Let's try.
L307505	u1429	m96	JIMMY	There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
L307504	u1430	m96	LINDA	We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
L307503	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
L307502	u1430	m96	LINDA	Don't go in.
L307500	u1430	m96	LINDA	Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
L307499	u1429	m96	JIMMY	But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
L307498	u1430	m96	LINDA	I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
L307497	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What is it?
L307491	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I know a way.
L307490	u1430	m96	LINDA	Damn.
L307489	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Hide the car.
L307488	u1430	m96	LINDA	No one comes here after dark.
L307486	u1430	m96	LINDA	All their lines were busy.
L307485	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Did you call the State Police?
L307482	u1430	m96	LINDA	The State Police.
L307481	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Who are you calling?
L307480	u1430	m96	LINDA	Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
L307473	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
L307472	u1430	m96	LINDA	Does it look to you like anything landed here?
L307469	u1430	m96	LINDA	We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
L307468	u1429	m96	JIMMY	They'll get us.
L307467	u1430	m96	LINDA	Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
L307466	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No.
L307465	u1430	m96	LINDA	But it's not, Jimmy.
L307464	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I swear it was here.
L307462	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No, but it was here.
L307461	u1430	m96	LINDA	I don't see anything.
L307460	u1429	m96	JIMMY	This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
L307457	u1430	m96	LINDA	If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
L307456	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Behind my house, up on the ridge.
L307455	u1430	m96	LINDA	Where, Jimmy?
L307454	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
L307453	u1430	m96	LINDA	Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
L307442	u1430	m96	LINDA	This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
L307441	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Yes.  I can even read star maps.
L307440	u1430	m96	LINDA	Do you know how to follow a map?
L307414	u1429	m96	JIMMY	'Cause he wouldn't lie.
L307413	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why?
L307412	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I'd believe him.
L307411	u1430	m96	LINDA	What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
L307410	u1429	m96	JIMMY	She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
L307409	u1430	m96	LINDA	How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
L307408	u1430	m96	LINDA	A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
L307407	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Yes.
L307406	u1430	m96	LINDA	That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
L307201	u1430	m96	LINDA	Can you tell me about that?
L307200	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
L307199	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
L307198	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No.
L307197	u1430	m96	LINDA	This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
L307673	u1431	m96	MOM	Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
L307672	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What kind, Mom?
L307671	u1431	m96	MOM	It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
L307396	u1431	m96	MOM	I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
L307395	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I have school.
L307394	u1431	m96	MOM	This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
L307393	u1429	m96	JIMMY	When?
L307380	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
L307379	u1431	m96	MOM	What?
L307378	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
L307344	u1429	m96	JIMMY	The back door was open.
L307343	u1431	m96	MOM	Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
L307304	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What? -- I... 
L307303	u1431	m96	MOM	Your father asked you a question.
L307296	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What happened to your other slipper?
L307295	u1431	m96	MOM	George, where have you been?
L307290	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
L307289	u1431	m96	MOM	What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
L307274	u1431	m96	MOM	I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
L307273	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Mom -- this is the best show all year.
L307272	u1431	m96	MOM	Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
L307422	u1430	m96	LINDA	All right.  I'll be right back.
L307421	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
L307420	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why, yes.
L307419	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
L307184	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
L307183	u1430	m96	LINDA	What's his family background?
L307182	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Oh?
L307181	u1430	m96	LINDA	His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
L307180	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
L307179	u1430	m96	LINDA	What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
L317672	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
L317671	u1631	m107	DALLAS	I don't have all day, kid.
L317669	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Alright, asshole.
L317668	u1631	m107	DALLAS	Okay, enough of this shit.
L317667	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Oh, come on!
L317666	u1631	m107	DALLAS	Yes it does.
L317665	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Asshole that does not count as a kill.
L317662	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
L317661	u1631	m107	DALLAS	He's not part of the program.
L317660	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Pause play.
L317659	u1631	m107	DALLAS	That sucks. Why won't he go down?
L317656	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Speaking of which, duck!
L317655	u1631	m107	DALLAS	You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
L317654	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	You got lucky.
L317653	u1631	m107	DALLAS	That's nine to four, geek-boy.
L317476	u1631	m107	DALLAS	Punk?
L317475	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Watch it punk, I'm armed.
L318316	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
L318315	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
L318269	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Delongpre! Out of time!
L318268	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
L318243	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Done?
L318242	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
L318222	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We made it?
L318221	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Minimal.
L318182	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I don't know. Nothing.
L318181	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What?
L318180	u1639	m107	RIZZO	His mother?
L318151	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
L318150	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Can we blow it with just two?
L318124	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	We don't have a choice!
L318123	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We can't lead him into the other hull!
L318042	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
L318041	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	When the left hull goes, so will the right.
L318024	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
L318023	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What's that?
L318011	u1639	m107	RIZZO	No.
L318010	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
L318009	u1639	m107	RIZZO	If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
L318008	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What are you doing?!!
L318006	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
L318005	u1639	m107	RIZZO	It's locked!
L317971	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Could you show a little compassion?!
L317970	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
L317969	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Goodbye old friend.
L317961	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We don't have time to argue!
L317960	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	We're not leaving Crutch!
L317959	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
L317919	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What do you mean, not enough time?
L317918	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
L317782	u1639	m107	RIZZO	He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
L317781	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Duck fuckers?
L318306	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Get out of here!
L318305	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Sergeant!
L318250	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
L318249	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Can't shut em' down from here.
L318172	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Rizzo did.
L318171	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
L318163	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
L318162	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Bomb?
L318159	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
L318158	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Sergeant? We thought you were...
L318157	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
L318133	u1634	m107	JANESSA	He came for me, I had to run!
L318132	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Where the hell were you?!!
L318120	u1634	m107	JANESSA	He....He...
L318119	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Where have you been?!!
L317992	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan, pull us in.
L317991	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Okay that hurt.
L317941	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Kkinsa! Open the doors!
L317940	u1634	m107	JANESSA	What?!
L317939	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Uh-oh.
L318291	u1640	m107	THORGAN	This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
L318290	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan, suit up.
L318289	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Goodbye, my love.
L318187	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Let's move out!
L318186	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Done!
L318185	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Two more charges to go.
L318184	u1640	m107	THORGAN	As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
L318174	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What are you doing back?!!
L318173	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em!
L318094	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I'm coming, I'm coming.
L318093	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
L318062	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
L318061	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Hey! I'm not ready.
L318058	u1640	m107	THORGAN	They're back here.
L318057	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	I'll need system four converters.
L318050	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What are you gonna do, tell me?
L318049	u1640	m107	THORGAN	We're not supposed to do that.
L318002	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
L318001	u1640	m107	THORGAN	The hull's imploding!
L318000	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Shit!
L317965	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I think I broke my arm.
L317964	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Everyone okay?
L317914	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Where'd you get the gun?
L317913	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Better let me.
L317760	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
L317759	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You see that?
L317444	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	And you said high school was boring.
L317443	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Nice touch.
L317349	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Cool.
L317348	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Creepy.
L318311	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Hey, easy now.
L318310	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
L318309	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Boeman, the ships not here.
L318283	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Suit up.
L318282	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Earth II.
L318241	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	And now we're all out of it.
L318240	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	It bought us some time.
L318211	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Faster! Don't we have another gun?
L318210	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Hurry!
L318153	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	I don't know!
L318152	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Then what do we do?!
L318141	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Then stop talking and work faster!
L318140	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
L318118	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
L318117	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Where is...?
L318070	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan? You coming?!
L318069	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
L318060	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Bring 'em all. Let's move!
L318059	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	How many?
L318048	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	We could convert fission transistors.
L318047	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	We'd need charges.
L317645	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
L317644	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
L317797	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	What?
L317796	u1641	m107	YLLO	Sergeant!
L317777	u1641	m107	YLLO	But I didn't see...
L317776	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
L317775	u1641	m107	YLLO	Ok Sarge, what's your status?
L317745	u1641	m107	YLLO	Yeah yeah. Got it.
L317744	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You just keep an eye out.
L317743	u1641	m107	YLLO	Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
L317738	u1641	m107	YLLO	At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
L317737	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
L317719	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You got that right.
L317718	u1641	m107	YLLO	JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
L317717	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Not a chance.
L317716	u1641	m107	YLLO	ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
L317707	u1641	m107	YLLO	Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
L317706	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Yllo, what's your head count?
L317615	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
L317614	u1641	m107	YLLO	Wait a minute...I need...
L317577	u1641	m107	YLLO	Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
L317576	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	My job.
L317575	u1641	m107	YLLO	What the hell are you doing?
L317474	u1641	m107	YLLO	That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
L317473	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Jesus what the hell is that?
L317472	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
L317471	u1641	m107	YLLO	I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
L317470	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
L317469	u1641	m107	YLLO	I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
L317468	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
L317467	u1641	m107	YLLO	Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
L317466	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
L317461	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
L317460	u1641	m107	YLLO	Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
L317459	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You're a teacher.
L317458	u1641	m107	YLLO	I am an expert!
L317457	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
L317453	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
L317452	u1641	m107	YLLO	Get them in the lab!
L318239	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
L318238	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	We need weapons.
L317712	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
L317711	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
L317710	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I need to know what you know about this guy.
L317692	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
L317691	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
L317686	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
L317685	u1639	m107	RIZZO	He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
L317639	u1639	m107	RIZZO	No, you're dead! You're all dead!
L317638	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
L317637	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Where is he?
L317636	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I'm with you kid.
L317769	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
L317768	u1636	m107	KICKER	Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
L317749	u1636	m107	KICKER	Negative.
L317748	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Kicker, anything?
L317723	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
L317722	u1636	m107	KICKER	Fuckin A...
L317721	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
L317703	u1636	m107	KICKER	Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
L317702	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
L317649	u1636	m107	KICKER	Oh man, what the hell happened?
L317648	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Jesus, God!
L318236	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I'm pulling, damnit!
L318235	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Pull me in!
L318109	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
L318108	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
L318107	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
L318106	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
L318105	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Give me a break! What happened?
L318104	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
L318103	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Where is everybody? What happened?
L318340	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I get it.
L318339	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
L318338	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Old woman?
L318337	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	No thank you, you crazy old woman.
L318336	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
L318335	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You okay?!
L318333	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I'm stuck!
L318332	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, pull away!
L318330	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I know you.
L318329	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Delongpre, you don't even know me.
L318326	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I think so, why?
L318325	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Did you like it?
L318324	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I think I had some when I was eight.
L318323	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
L318321	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
L318320	u1639	m107	RIZZO	No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
L318319	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, you okay?
L318314	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You'll be fine.
L318313	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Okay, good tip.
L318312	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You wanna release your air tanks?
L318294	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Eat me.
L318293	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
L318292	u1639	m107	RIZZO	His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
L318278	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Oh sure, all the time.
L318277	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Got it.  You ever space walked?
L318256	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
L318255	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You?
L318254	u1639	m107	RIZZO	You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
L318232	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Not so bad.
L318231	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	See? We're not so bad.
L318100	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
L318099	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I couldn't save them.
L318098	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	And what happend to ...?
L318097	u1639	m107	RIZZO	They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
L318089	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Were you close to your father?
L318088	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
L318081	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
L318080	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I thought you meant...
L318079	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
L318078	u1639	m107	RIZZO	So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
L318077	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That's why I'm here.
L318038	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
L318037	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What's this?
L318036	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Hey!!
L318035	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
L318034	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Hey.
L318013	u1639	m107	RIZZO	It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
L318012	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo?!
L317988	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	What if we don't?
L317987	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What if you miss?
L317958	u1639	m107	RIZZO	400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
L317957	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	We're screwed!
L317948	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I guessed.
L317947	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Med-kit?
L317946	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
L317944	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
L317943	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
L317934	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	No you don't!
L317933	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
L317924	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Guys!!! The shuttle?
L317923	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
L317830	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
L317829	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, he's out there.
L317784	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
L317783	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Outta here?
L317694	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I hope so.
L317693	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
L317688	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We have to get off this ship.
L317687	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Where are you going?
L317855	u1641	m107	YLLO	They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
L317854	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
L317853	u1641	m107	YLLO	Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
L317852	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
L317851	u1641	m107	YLLO	We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
L317820	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	No shit. I got no problem with that.
L317819	u1641	m107	YLLO	Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
L317635	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Oh I like her a lot.
L317634	u1641	m107	YLLO	God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
L317629	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
L317628	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
L317627	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That's really funny.
L317626	u1641	m107	YLLO	More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
L317625	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	She needs a little time.
L317624	u1641	m107	YLLO	Well?
L317591	u1641	m107	YLLO	She broke my fucking nose!
L317590	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Spunky . . .
L317574	u1641	m107	YLLO	I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
L317573	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
L317572	u1641	m107	YLLO	It's time.
L317529	u1641	m107	YLLO	We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
L317528	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Now what?
L318328	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Shut up, Thorgan!
L318327	u1640	m107	THORGAN	He's trying to ask you out on a date.
L318300	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well, do something!
L318299	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
L318285	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
L318284	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I'll help you in.
L318275	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Just come on, I've got an idea.
L318274	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Okay?!!
L318245	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Again?! Jesus!
L318244	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kaboom.
L318092	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I'm on my way.
L318091	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
L317928	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
L317927	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
L317894	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	He's right behind us!
L317893	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
L317863	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	We're screwed.
L317862	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Yuck.
L317818	u1640	m107	THORGAN	She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
L317817	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Now hold on! We should hear her out!
L318215	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	NO!
L318214	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Close the fucking door!
L318213	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	They'll make it.
L318212	u1634	m107	JANESSA	They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
L318149	u1634	m107	JANESSA	He was chasing me!
L318148	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You lost the charge?
L318147	u1634	m107	JANESSA	I...I don't know what I did...
L317983	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
L317982	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Push off toward us.
L318288	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
L318287	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
L318248	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
L318247	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	You must shut down the engines.
L318055	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
L318054	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Now this is getting exciting.
L317891	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	GO, GO, GO!
L317890	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Now that's just gross.
L317518	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
L317517	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	And what's with the headgear?
L317774	u1641	m107	YLLO	Thank you.
L317773	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
L317772	u1641	m107	YLLO	We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
L317771	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
L317770	u1641	m107	YLLO	Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
L317446	u1641	m107	YLLO	Just get us to the ship!
L317445	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
L317357	u1641	m107	YLLO	Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
L317356	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
L317329	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
L317328	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'm missing two!
L318064	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You're leaving me here alone?
L318063	u1634	m107	JANESSA	You're so bossy.
L318053	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Would you?
L318052	u1634	m107	JANESSA	YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
L318030	u1634	m107	JANESSA	A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
L318029	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
L318015	u1634	m107	JANESSA	So what else is new?
L318014	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Hurry! She's lost it!
L317998	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Let's just get out of here.
L317997	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
L317985	u1634	m107	JANESSA	That ought'a help the situation.
L317984	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I'm gonna spew.
L317516	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Small brains make your balls itch?
L317515	u1640	m107	THORGAN	This is what it means right here.
L317875	u1641	m107	YLLO	Crutch?
L317874	u1634	m107	JANESSA	What do we do?!!
L317835	u1641	m107	YLLO	Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
L317834	u1634	m107	JANESSA	What are you doing?
L317814	u1641	m107	YLLO	Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
L317813	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
L317641	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Oh my God! Adrienne?
L317640	u1641	m107	YLLO	Jesus!
L317542	u1634	m107	JANESSA	You prefer an apple?
L317541	u1641	m107	YLLO	Later.
L317540	u1634	m107	JANESSA	You're quicker than usual.
L318161	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
L318160	u1634	m107	JANESSA	I don't know...sorry?
L318046	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
L318045	u1634	m107	JANESSA	I'm just saying.
L318044	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
L318028	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
L318027	u1634	m107	JANESSA	No.
L318017	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
L318016	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
L317647	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Maybe she tripped.
L317646	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
L318177	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
L318176	u1639	m107	RIZZO	You killed him?
L318175	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
L318026	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Are there any other shuttles?
L318025	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
L317732	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	You need to get laid!
L317731	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I'm surrounded by idiots.
L317730	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I'm afraid I cannot assist.
L317729	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
L317728	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
L317727	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Barbie from hell...
L317726	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Kay-em 14.
L317725	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Robot huh?
L318345	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I love you.
L318344	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I missed you too.
L318343	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
L318342	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-em you okay?
L318225	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
L318224	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em we made it!
L318179	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
L318178	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
L318135	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
L318134	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em, you okay?
L318127	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Oh, alright.
L318126	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
L318125	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Do I have to?
L318084	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Good point.
L318083	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Who are you apologizing to?
L318082	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Sorry, sorry.
L318074	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
L318073	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
L318072	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Ow!
L318071	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Almost done.
L318067	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Come here, might as well fix that arm.
L318066	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	It's just you and me, then.
L318033	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Sory...
L318032	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Am I in there?
L318031	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
L317953	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Oh shit! There he is!
L317952	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I didn't say I was good at it.
L317383	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
L317382	u1640	m107	THORGAN	The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
L317339	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
L317338	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
L317337	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
L317431	u1641	m107	YLLO	No! He's coming with us!
L317430	u1636	m107	KICKER	Leave him behind!
L317411	u1636	m107	KICKER	Defense droids. I'm on it.
L317410	u1641	m107	YLLO	Kicker!
L317376	u1641	m107	YLLO	This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
L317375	u1636	m107	KICKER	Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
L317374	u1641	m107	YLLO	Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
L317334	u1636	m107	KICKER	Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
L317333	u1641	m107	YLLO	We're missing two of the kids!
L317332	u1636	m107	KICKER	Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
L317898	u1637	m107	KKINSA	But?!!
L317897	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I gotta go back.
L317896	u1637	m107	KKINSA	What?!!
L317895	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
L317873	u1637	m107	KKINSA	Thirty seconds.
L317872	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Then open the doors!
L317871	u1637	m107	KKINSA	The power's back up!
L317858	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Keep trying!
L317857	u1637	m107	KKINSA	Something's wrong.
L317850	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I just know.
L317849	u1637	m107	KKINSA	How do you know?
L317846	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Ssh.
L317845	u1637	m107	KKINSA	What?
L317801	u1639	m107	RIZZO	He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
L317800	u1637	m107	KKINSA	I don't understand...what does he want?
L317553	u1638	m107	PEREZ	See you then . . . doctor.
L317552	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
L317551	u1638	m107	PEREZ	If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
L317550	u1641	m107	YLLO	Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
L317549	u1638	m107	PEREZ	Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
L317548	u1641	m107	YLLO	Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
L317547	u1638	m107	PEREZ	Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
L317546	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'm sending you the files.
L317545	u1641	m107	YLLO	We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
L317544	u1638	m107	PEREZ	You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
L317889	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Three...two...one...
L317888	u1641	m107	YLLO	It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
L317828	u1641	m107	YLLO	You're crazy!
L317827	u1639	m107	RIZZO	How do you open the damn door?
L317816	u1641	m107	YLLO	4You're not going anywhere.
L317815	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Guys, please come with me!
L317812	u1639	m107	RIZZO	That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
L317811	u1641	m107	YLLO	Scientists. Very intellegent men.
L317810	u1639	m107	RIZZO	More soldiers?
L317809	u1641	m107	YLLO	They can deal with this sort of thing.
L317808	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What good will that do?
L317805	u1641	m107	YLLO	Are we locked down?
L317804	u1639	m107	RIZZO	You wanna die?
L317803	u1641	m107	YLLO	You're not going anywhere.
L317690	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
L317689	u1641	m107	YLLO	That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
L317675	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Get him out of there!
L317674	u1641	m107	YLLO	Azrael can you repeat that?
L317652	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I didn't say he was alive.
L317651	u1641	m107	YLLO	Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
L317650	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
L317633	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Are you finished?
L317632	u1641	m107	YLLO	Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
L317631	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Jason? He's on this ship?!
L317612	u1641	m107	YLLO	That's right, now if you could...
L317611	u1639	m107	RIZZO	But...I...400 years?
L317610	u1641	m107	YLLO	We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
L317605	u1639	m107	RIZZO	JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
L317604	u1641	m107	YLLO	Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
L317602	u1639	m107	RIZZO	30? How long was I out?
L317601	u1641	m107	YLLO	We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
L317600	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
L317599	u1641	m107	YLLO	Nanotechnology.
L317598	u1639	m107	RIZZO	How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
L317596	u1641	m107	YLLO	Obviously so.
L317595	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
L318273	u1640	m107	THORGAN	It's okay.
L318272	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Guys, he's right behind us!
L318040	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Sure but what good will that do?
L318039	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Can we get through these?
L317826	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
L317825	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
L317780	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
L317779	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Yes!
L317752	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Exactly.
L317751	u1639	m107	RIZZO	So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
L317643	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What have I done?! Idiots.
L317642	u1640	m107	THORGAN	What have you done?
L317609	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Old Earth?
L317608	u1640	m107	THORGAN	He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
L317607	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Hockey player? He's not a ...
L317606	u1640	m107	THORGAN	The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
L350818	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Absolutely not.
L350817	u1846	m121	NICKY	Now will you get in the flask?
L350806	u1846	m121	NICKY	No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
L350805	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Is this a joke?
L350804	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
L350803	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Little Nicky.
L350740	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
L350739	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
L350657	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I hear a train coming. Drink.
L350656	u1846	m121	NICKY	Let her go.
L350655	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
L350383	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
L350382	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
L350381	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
L350380	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
L350379	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	He's sick?
L350378	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
L350375	u1846	m121	NICKY	Please, get out of my mind!
L350374	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	You shouldn't have come here.
L350373	u1846	m121	NICKY	ADRIAN!
L350864	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Don't do it!
L350863	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	No!
L350825	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
L350824	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
L350650	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You mother...
L350649	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
L350648	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	All right. Let me out.
L350647	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Hello, Cassius.
L350249	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
L350248	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
L350247	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I lowered the drinking age to ten.
L350246	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
L350245	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Let the sin begins -- that was a good one.
L350127	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	It's our time, brother.
L350126	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	...their damned souls will be ours.
L350125	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
L350124	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
L350123	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	We could create our own hell there.
L350122	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	What do you think about... Earth?
L350121	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
L350120	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Could you concentrate for five seconds?
L350119	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	That's what I thought!
L350116	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
L350115	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
L350114	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	It's just such a slap in the face.
L350113	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	And he's dead serious.
L350112	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
L350067	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
L350066	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I knew it. He's finally retiring.
L350802	u1843	m121	JOHN	You want a queen? Got one right here.
L350801	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
L350645	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I'm calling you out, brother...
L350644	u1843	m121	JOHN	Urr... uggg... errr...
L350643	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
L350642	u1843	m121	JOHN	Uh. No it won't?
L350641	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
L350640	u1843	m121	JOHN	And give you a good buzz.
L350637	u1843	m121	JOHN	Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
L350636	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
L350624	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Sure, why not?
L350623	u1843	m121	JOHN	But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
L350619	u1843	m121	JOHN	Noon...
L350618	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
L350763	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
L350762	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	She goes to Parson's, right?
L350737	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	Show him Central Park.
L350736	u1835	m121	ANGEL	All these good people have totally been led astray.
L350731	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
L350730	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I'll call her later.
L350723	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
L350722	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
L350665	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	So excited.
L350664	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
L350785	u1835	m121	ANGEL	You're already there...
L350784	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
L350783	u1835	m121	ANGEL	It would be so okay.
L350782	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
L350776	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
L350775	u1846	m121	NICKY	What is it?
L350773	u1846	m121	NICKY	A speech impediment?
L350772	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
L350771	u1846	m121	NICKY	But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
L350765	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Yeah, you do...
L350764	u1846	m121	NICKY	I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
L350761	u1835	m121	ANGEL	She's so nice.
L350760	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie's crying!
L350735	u1835	m121	ANGEL	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
L350734	u1846	m121	NICKY	How did you see me?
L350729	u1846	m121	NICKY	"Well tell her I said ""hi"" back."
L350728	u1835	m121	ANGEL	"Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says ""hi."""
L350721	u1835	m121	ANGEL	It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
L350720	u1846	m121	NICKY	Where did you meet my father?
L350685	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Angels don't get any older, son.
L350684	u1846	m121	NICKY	How come you're not older?
L350680	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
L350679	u1846	m121	NICKY	Wow. What... what did she look like?
L350678	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
L350677	u1846	m121	NICKY	An angel?
L350676	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Try an angel.
L350675	u1846	m121	NICKY	My mom wasn't a goat?
L350674	u1835	m121	ANGEL	A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
L350673	u1846	m121	NICKY	My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
L350672	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
L350671	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Maybe try the opposite of that.
L350670	u1846	m121	NICKY	The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
L350800	u1836	m121	BEEFY	That turn you on there, RuPaul?
L350799	u1851	m121	TODD	Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
L350759	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I can't screw.  I can't screw.
L350758	u1851	m121	TODD	They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
L350612	u1836	m121	BEEFY	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
L350611	u1851	m121	TODD	Where is he? He's late.
L350432	u1836	m121	BEEFY	No.
L350431	u1851	m121	TODD	Did you just talk?
L350430	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
L350429	u1851	m121	TODD	What's Nicky doing down there?
L350567	u1836	m121	BEEFY	"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
L350566	u1846	m121	NICKY	This is baloney!
L350562	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I think you're looking at him.
L350561	u1846	m121	NICKY	I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
L350560	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
L350559	u1846	m121	NICKY	I didn't murder anybody
L350556	u1836	m121	BEEFY	The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
L350555	u1846	m121	NICKY	I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
L350486	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
L350485	u1846	m121	NICKY	We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
L350407	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
L350406	u1846	m121	NICKY	Release the evil?
L350405	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
L350404	u1836	m121	BEEFY	But those are my roommate's sodas... Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
L350403	u1846	m121	NICKY	But those are my roommate's sodas...
L350402	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Go get a soda out of the fridge.
L350401	u1846	m121	NICKY	Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
L350400	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
L350399	u1846	m121	NICKY	What can I do about it?
L350398	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
L350264	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
L350263	u1846	m121	NICKY	All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
L350254	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, let's rock and roll.
L350253	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
L350252	u1846	m121	NICKY	Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
L350251	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
L350250	u1846	m121	NICKY	This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
L350233	u1846	m121	NICKY	Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
L350232	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
L350217	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
L350216	u1846	m121	NICKY	From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
L350209	u1846	m121	NICKY	I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
L350208	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
L350207	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
L350204	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Put it in your mouth.
L350203	u1846	m121	NICKY	So far, so good. Now what?
L350202	u1836	m121	BEEFY	That pain is hunger.
L350201	u1846	m121	NICKY	I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
L350200	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
L350199	u1846	m121	NICKY	It's freezing up here, Beefy.
L350198	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Makin' friends already.
L350194	u1846	m121	NICKY	Oh. Sorry.
L350193	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It's not me, moron.
L350192	u1846	m121	NICKY	"Okay, ""bro,"" this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there."
L350191	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
L350190	u1846	m121	NICKY	I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
L350189	u1836	m121	BEEFY	My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
L350161	u1839	m121	DAD	Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
L350160	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
L350159	u1839	m121	DAD	Please, pop, just go back to your room.
L350158	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
L350157	u1839	m121	DAD	Everything's fine, pop.
L350156	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
L350144	u1839	m121	DAD	Now you're talking.
L350143	u1840	m121	DAN	This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
L350142	u1839	m121	DAD	Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
L350141	u1840	m121	DAN	You did it for Namath.
L350140	u1839	m121	DAD	In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
L350139	u1840	m121	DAN	C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
L350138	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
L350596	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
L350595	u1839	m121	DAD	Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
L350594	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Check one-two. Check one-two.
L350591	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
L350590	u1839	m121	DAD	I got no ears! I can't hear!
L350099	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
L350098	u1839	m121	DAD	No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
L350097	u1839	m121	DAD	Yes, Jimmy.
L350096	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Knock, knock.
L350859	u1846	m121	NICKY	I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
L350858	u1839	m121	DAD	Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
L350854	u1839	m121	DAD	Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
L350853	u1846	m121	NICKY	What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
L350852	u1839	m121	DAD	You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
L350851	u1846	m121	NICKY	I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
L350850	u1839	m121	DAD	You came through, Nicky.
L350593	u1839	m121	DAD	I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
L350592	u1846	m121	NICKY	Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
L350589	u1839	m121	DAD	What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
L350588	u1846	m121	NICKY	Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
L350186	u1839	m121	DAD	Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
L350185	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
L350184	u1839	m121	DAD	That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
L350180	u1839	m121	DAD	Son, just do your best.
L350179	u1846	m121	NICKY	No. This can't be happening.
L350175	u1846	m121	NICKY	Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
L350174	u1839	m121	DAD	Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
L350168	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
L350167	u1846	m121	NICKY	So go get 'em, Dad!
L350166	u1839	m121	DAD	To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
L350155	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
L350154	u1846	m121	NICKY	How bad?
L350153	u1839	m121	DAD	This is bad, Nicky.
L350146	u1839	m121	DAD	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
L350145	u1846	m121	NICKY	You're a good devil, Dad.
L350137	u1839	m121	DAD	I was just playing with you.
L350136	u1846	m121	NICKY	Metallica, Dad. Come on.
L350135	u1839	m121	DAD	Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
L350134	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
L350133	u1839	m121	DAD	I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
L350132	u1846	m121	NICKY	Definitely.
L350131	u1839	m121	DAD	"Now that was an experience. ""You are only coming through in waves."" That line blows my mind every time."
L350106	u1839	m121	DAD	The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
L350105	u1846	m121	NICKY	I mean... tough break.
L350102	u1839	m121	DAD	Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
L350101	u1846	m121	NICKY	Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
L350100	u1839	m121	DAD	This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
L350093	u1839	m121	DAD	Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
L350092	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
L350091	u1839	m121	DAD	Now everybody sit down.
L350088	u1839	m121	DAD	Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
L350087	u1846	m121	NICKY	Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
L350260	u1846	m121	NICKY	Beast.
L350259	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Bus?
L350215	u1846	m121	NICKY	You got it.
L350214	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350213	u1846	m121	NICKY	Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350212	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Thanks.
L350211	u1846	m121	NICKY	That's a pretty brassiere.
L350210	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Hey.
L350152	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	That's what I'm thinkin'...
L350151	u1846	m121	NICKY	Coulda been much worse.
L350150	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
L350355	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
L350354	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
L350353	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Boogerland!
L350352	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	What was it called, sir.
L350351	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
L350350	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	It's Stanley, sir.
L350349	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
L350347	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
L350346	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	I know, your wickedness.
L350345	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	You know, I was the one who created Hell.
L350183	u1846	m121	NICKY	I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
L350182	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
L350173	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
L350172	u1846	m121	NICKY	I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
L350171	u1846	m121	NICKY	You're not saying it's up to me?
L350170	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
L350169	u1846	m121	NICKY	So go get 'em, Jimmy!
L350165	u1846	m121	NICKY	We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
L350164	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
L350065	u1846	m121	NICKY	Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
L350064	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
L350063	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey...
L350795	u1843	m121	JOHN	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
L350794	u1851	m121	TODD	His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
L350484	u1851	m121	TODD	Oh, would you grow up.
L350483	u1843	m121	JOHN	Easy, Liberace.
L350478	u1851	m121	TODD	No.
L350477	u1843	m121	JOHN	By she, do you mean he?
L350476	u1851	m121	TODD	I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
L350464	u1851	m121	TODD	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
L350463	u1843	m121	JOHN	No wonder your uncle's so weird...
L350757	u1843	m121	JOHN	Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
L350756	u1847	m121	PETER	This don't look good.
L350631	u1847	m121	PETER	Peppermint... alright.
L350630	u1843	m121	JOHN	Schnapps...
L350600	u1847	m121	PETER	We know where to find Nicky.
L350599	u1843	m121	JOHN	Looking for the chief.
L350598	u1843	m121	JOHN	Little nervous. Wanna puke.
L350597	u1847	m121	PETER	You sure you're down with this?
L350490	u1847	m121	PETER	We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
L350489	u1843	m121	JOHN	That's a big pass, Elton John.
L350428	u1843	m121	JOHN	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
L350427	u1847	m121	PETER	Look who's back from the dead.
L350281	u1843	m121	JOHN	The Dark Prince is here.
L350280	u1847	m121	PETER	Did you check out the dragon mouth?
L350274	u1843	m121	JOHN	Yeah. You do it.
L350273	u1847	m121	PETER	Should we wake him up?
L350272	u1843	m121	JOHN	Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
L350271	u1847	m121	PETER	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
L350270	u1843	m121	JOHN	What's with that guy?
L350269	u1847	m121	PETER	Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
L350268	u1843	m121	JOHN	There's our man.
L350267	u1843	m121	JOHN	'Bout time...
L350266	u1847	m121	PETER	Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
L350493	u1846	m121	NICKY	See ya, fellas.
L350492	u1843	m121	JOHN	Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
L350491	u1846	m121	NICKY	No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
L350468	u1846	m121	NICKY	Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
L350467	u1843	m121	JOHN	Come on. One more time.
L350461	u1846	m121	NICKY	Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
L350460	u1843	m121	JOHN	What's Ozzy trying to say there?
L350278	u1843	m121	JOHN	That way.
L350277	u1846	m121	NICKY	Which way did he go?
L350397	u1848	m121	REGIS	I was DeNiro!
L350396	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	Yes, great movie...
L350395	u1848	m121	REGIS	Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
L350394	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	You keep a bat under your seat?
L350393	u1848	m121	REGIS	I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
L350392	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	You followed him?
L350391	u1848	m121	REGIS	So I followed him...
L350390	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
L350389	u1848	m121	REGIS	So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
L350842	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'll just go to Heaven.
L350841	u1847	m121	PETER	You gotta kill yourself.
L350580	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
L350579	u1847	m121	PETER	Dude. Seriously?
L350578	u1846	m121	NICKY	Good idea... kill me.
L350570	u1847	m121	PETER	Dude, it's us. Let us in.
L350569	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
L350470	u1846	m121	NICKY	All right...
L350469	u1847	m121	PETER	Please. You got to.
L350524	u1846	m121	NICKY	Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
L350523	u1850	m121	STUDENT	You got the wrong window again, man.
L350506	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Andrew.
L350505	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian?
L350504	u1850	m121	STUDENT	I don't need luck. I'm good.
L350503	u1846	m121	NICKY	Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
L350502	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
L350501	u1846	m121	NICKY	No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
L350500	u1850	m121	STUDENT	"It's ""Comptoir Sud Pacific."" Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?"
L350499	u1846	m121	NICKY	You smell like coconuts.
L350498	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Hello.
L350848	u1846	m121	NICKY	I love you.
L350847	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I love you.
L350846	u1846	m121	NICKY	Do me.
L350831	u1846	m121	NICKY	From my dad's side of the family.
L350830	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
L350828	u1846	m121	NICKY	That was Cassius!
L350827	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Nicky!
L350659	u1846	m121	NICKY	I have to, Valerie.
L350658	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Don't do it.
L350548	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head...
L350547	u1846	m121	NICKY	I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
L350546	u1846	m121	NICKY	East Rutherford.
L350545	u1852	m121	VALERIE	We're going to Jersey?
L350544	u1846	m121	NICKY	Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
L350543	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Can we go fly over Central Park?
L350537	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Okay, I do. Get back up here.
L350536	u1846	m121	NICKY	You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
L350533	u1846	m121	NICKY	...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
L350532	u1852	m121	VALERIE	"...""The Devil?""..."
L350531	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
L350530	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Yes...
L350529	u1846	m121	NICKY	Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
L350528	u1852	m121	VALERIE	"What do you mean, ""possessed?"""
L350527	u1846	m121	NICKY	That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
L350526	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
L350521	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
L350520	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
L350519	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Why would you be floating?
L350518	u1846	m121	NICKY	I think I'm floating.
L350517	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What are you doing?
L350516	u1846	m121	NICKY	No.
L350515	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Are you dead?
L350514	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie?
L350511	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
L350510	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What were you thinking coming here?
L350508	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
L350507	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey.
L350370	u1846	m121	NICKY	I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
L350369	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What was that?
L350368	u1846	m121	NICKY	Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
L350367	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What?
L350366	u1846	m121	NICKY	Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
L350365	u1852	m121	VALERIE	You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
L350364	u1846	m121	NICKY	Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
L350363	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Basically, yeah.
L350362	u1846	m121	NICKY	So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
L350343	u1846	m121	NICKY	Good. I was concerned.
L350342	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Sometimes, sure.
L350341	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
L350339	u1852	m121	VALERIE	My perfume?
L350338	u1846	m121	NICKY	What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
L350337	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
L350336	u1846	m121	NICKY	School?
L350335	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
L350332	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
L350331	u1852	m121	VALERIE	You have a dog? What kind?
L350330	u1846	m121	NICKY	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
L350329	u1852	m121	VALERIE	This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
L350327	u1852	m121	VALERIE	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
L350326	u1846	m121	NICKY	It's freezing my hands.
L350325	u1846	m121	NICKY	Uh, it's a deep south expression.
L350324	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Octopus people?
L350323	u1846	m121	NICKY	Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
L350322	u1852	m121	VALERIE	If you want to.
L350321	u1846	m121	NICKY	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
L350320	u1852	m121	VALERIE	That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
L350319	u1846	m121	NICKY	Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
L350318	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
L350317	u1846	m121	NICKY	If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
L350316	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
L350315	u1846	m121	NICKY	My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
L350314	u1852	m121	VALERIE	My dad's an optometrist.
L350313	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
L350312	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Why are you laughing?
L350311	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
L350310	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Really?
L350309	u1846	m121	NICKY	The South.
L350308	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
L350307	u1846	m121	NICKY	You think I'm a tourist?
L350306	u1852	m121	VALERIE	That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
L350305	u1846	m121	NICKY	That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
L350583	u1851	m121	TODD	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
L350582	u1846	m121	NICKY	That just hurt a lot.
L350482	u1851	m121	TODD	Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
L350481	u1846	m121	NICKY	A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
L350419	u1846	m121	NICKY	If it's Cassius, yes.
L350418	u1851	m121	TODD	A black guy?
L350417	u1846	m121	NICKY	It looks like the work of a brother...
L350231	u1851	m121	TODD	And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
L350230	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know.
L350229	u1851	m121	TODD	Why is that funny?
L350228	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah. The deep South.
L350227	u1851	m121	TODD	It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
L350226	u1846	m121	NICKY	No.
L350225	u1851	m121	TODD	Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
L350224	u1846	m121	NICKY	Off limits.
L350223	u1851	m121	TODD	Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
L350222	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. What is rent?
L350221	u1851	m121	TODD	Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
L350220	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
L350295	u1846	m121	NICKY	Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
L350294	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
L350288	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know?
L350287	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	"And if that is your so-called ""flask,"" how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?"
L350286	u1846	m121	NICKY	No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
L350285	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	You callin' me a thief, my man?
L350284	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. I would like my flask back.
L350283	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	See something you like, my man?

L356070	u1866	m123	V	You want somethin'?
L356068	u1866	m123	V	You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
L356067	u1883	m123	PETE	Listen.
L356066	u1866	m123	V	Texaco... What's wrong with that?
L356065	u1883	m123	PETE	"This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, ""V""?"
L356057	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.
L356056	u1866	m123	V	Sure, what's wrong with that?
L356055	u1883	m123	PETE	"Sheila'll be at ""Tops""."
L356054	u1866	m123	V	"Just goin' up'ta ""Tops""... Maybe the ""Ten Pin""."
L356050	u1883	m123	PETE	Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
L356049	u1866	m123	V	Good... You up for a drive?
L356048	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't think so.
L356047	u1866	m123	V	You're not contagious are you?
L355812	u1877	m123	FRED	I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
L355811	u1867	m123	AL	Why not?
L355776	u1877	m123	FRED	It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
L355775	u1867	m123	AL	Why not?
L355772	u1877	m123	FRED	How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
L355771	u1867	m123	AL	What do you mean by that?
L355770	u1877	m123	FRED	I like to remember things my own way.
L355764	u1877	m123	FRED	Yes, I thought my wife...
L355763	u1867	m123	AL	You're a musician?
L355760	u1877	m123	FRED	This is our bedroom.
L355759	u1867	m123	AL	Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
L355806	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
L355805	u1867	m123	AL	We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
L355781	u1885	m123	RENEE	No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
L355780	u1867	m123	AL	Maid? Relative?
L355779	u1885	m123	RENEE	No.
L355769	u1885	m123	RENEE	No. Fred hates them.
L355768	u1867	m123	AL	Do you own a video camera?
L355753	u1867	m123	AL	The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
L355752	u1885	m123	RENEE	What is?
L355751	u1867	m123	AL	Very strange.
L356418	u1876	m123	ED	There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
L356417	u1867	m123	AL	What's that, Ed?
L356416	u1876	m123	ED	You know what I think?
L356415	u1867	m123	AL	We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
L356233	u1867	m123	AL	Ours, Ed.
L356232	u1876	m123	ED	His or ours?
L356231	u1867	m123	AL	What a fuckin' job.
L356162	u1867	m123	AL	Yeah... Laurent.
L356161	u1876	m123	ED	You recognize that guy?
L356025	u1876	m123	ED	Yeah.
L356024	u1867	m123	AL	Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
L355801	u1876	m123	ED	Or not so recently?
L355800	u1867	m123	AL	Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
L355797	u1876	m123	ED	Or something.
L355796	u1867	m123	AL	You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
L355785	u1867	m123	AL	If anything else happens, you'll call us.
L355784	u1876	m123	ED	As best we can.
L355783	u1867	m123	AL	We'll keep a watch on the house.
L355778	u1867	m123	AL	Anybody else have a key to the house.
L355777	u1876	m123	ED	Might be a good time to try using it again.
L355757	u1867	m123	AL	Right... This just glided along.
L355756	u1876	m123	ED	Like you'd get if it was hand held.
L355755	u1867	m123	AL	And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
L355754	u1876	m123	ED	How'd the camera get so high like that?
L356395	u1883	m123	PETE	Alice?
L356394	u1868	m123	ALICE	Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
L356389	u1868	m123	ALICE	Up the stairs - down the hall.
L356388	u1883	m123	PETE	Where's the bathroom?
L356384	u1868	m123	ALICE	We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.

L355844	u1877	m123	FRED	I don't. I don't know him.
L355843	u1869	m123	ANDY	He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
L355842	u1877	m123	FRED	But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
L355841	u1869	m123	ANDY	Yes, I believe so.
L355840	u1877	m123	FRED	Dick Laurent?
L355839	u1869	m123	ANDY	I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.

L356254	u1883	m123	PETE	What happened to me?
L356253	u1871	m123	BILL	We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
L356252	u1883	m123	PETE	Did you tell the police this?
L356251	u1871	m123	BILL	Never saw him before in my life.
L356248	u1883	m123	PETE	What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
L356247	u1871	m123	BILL	Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
L356246	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila?
L356243	u1883	m123	PETE	But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
L356242	u1871	m123	BILL	They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
L356241	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah? what did they want?
L356240	u1871	m123	BILL	The police called us.

L356032	u1883	m123	PETE	Better.
L356016	u1888	m123	WARDEN	All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
L356015	u1871	m123	BILL	Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
L356014	u1888	m123	WARDEN	No.
L356013	u1871	m123	BILL	Have you made any charges against him?
L355977	u1871	m123	BILL	Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
L355976	u1888	m123	WARDEN	His physical condition.
L355975	u1871	m123	BILL	His condition? What do you mean?
L355972	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Yes.
L355971	u1871	m123	BILL	The wife killer?
L355970	u1888	m123	WARDEN	A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
L356245	u1871	m123	BILL	You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
L356244	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	We saw you that night, Pete.

L356029	u1871	m123	BILL	You talk to him?
L356028	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Out in back.
L356027	u1871	m123	BILL	Where's Pete?
L356020	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
L356019	u1871	m123	BILL	Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
L356018	u1888	m123	WARDEN	We'll get a tail put on him.
L356017	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	You just gonna let him go?
L355962	u1888	m123	WARDEN	What's the word on the street?
L355961	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	One of the guards must have leaked it.
L355956	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
L355955	u1888	m123	WARDEN	How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
L355942	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
L355941	u1888	m123	WARDEN	If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
L355940	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
L355939	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Did you ask him who he is?
L355938	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	He's in the infirmary, being examined.
L355937	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Where is he now?
L355936	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
L355935	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
L355934	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
L355933	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Repeat that, Bill.
L355932	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
L355931	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Yeah, Mack?
L355930	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
L355929	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Who is it?
L355928	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	No, sir, it's not.
L355927	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	That's not Fred Madison?
L355926	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
L355925	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Now, Mack, what's the situation?
L356001	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Pete, what happened to you?
L356000	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
L355998	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
L355997	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	I want to see him.
L355993	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	He didn't come home.
L355992	u1888	m123	WARDEN	What about yesterday?
L355991	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	When he went to work, right.
L355990	u1888	m123	WARDEN	You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
L355989	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	I wouldn't know how.
L356350	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	He won't give his name.
L356349	u1883	m123	PETE	Who is it?
L356250	u1883	m123	PETE	Who was the man?
L356249	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	We know that.
L356216	u1883	m123	PETE	Nothin'.
L356215	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	What's the matter?
L356041	u1883	m123	PETE	No... I don't. Why?
L356040	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Do you remember?
L356022	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Coming up.
L356021	u1883	m123	PETE	No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
L355952	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
L355951	u1888	m123	WARDEN	A headache?
L355950	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
L355949	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	Not even close.
L355948	u1888	m123	WARDEN	He's not Madison?
L355947	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
L355946	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Who is this man?
L355945	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	I don't know yet.
L355944	u1888	m123	WARDEN	What is this, Rogoff?
L356143	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	"FUCKIN' ""A""."
L356142	u1875	m123	DRIVER	I'll get a manual.  and study it.
L356141	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
L356140	u1875	m123	DRIVER	No.
L356139	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
L356138	u1875	m123	DRIVER	I won't ever tailgate.
L356135	u1875	m123	DRIVER	I... I didn't say anything...
L356134	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	WHAT DID YOU SAY?
L355810	u1877	m123	FRED	The first night... Not the last two.
L355809	u1876	m123	ED	Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
L355767	u1876	m123	ED	Tone deaf.
L355766	u1877	m123	FRED	Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
L355765	u1876	m123	ED	What's your axe?
L355762	u1877	m123	FRED	No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
L355761	u1876	m123	ED	There's no other bedroom?
L355750	u1876	m123	ED	Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
L355749	u1877	m123	FRED	That's it.
L355919	u1877	m123	FRED	But my head...
L355918	u1878	m123	GUARD	The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
L355917	u1877	m123	FRED	Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
L355916	u1878	m123	GUARD	What is it?
L355912	u1878	m123	GUARD	I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
L355911	u1877	m123	FRED	The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
L355910	u1878	m123	GUARD	What's bothering you, Madison?
L355909	u1877	m123	FRED	No, no. I want to go in.
L355908	u1878	m123	GUARD	Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
L355907	u1877	m123	FRED	My... My head.
L355906	u1878	m123	GUARD	Something wrong?
L356409	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	Alice who?
L356408	u1877	m123	FRED	Where's Alice?
L355824	u1877	m123	FRED	That's absurd.
L355823	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	At your house.
L355822	u1877	m123	FRED	What do you mean? You're where right now?
L355821	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
L355820	u1877	m123	FRED	No, no I don't. Are you sure?
L355819	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	At your house. Don't you remember?
L355818	u1877	m123	FRED	I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
L355817	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	We've met before, haven't we?
L355860	u1877	m123	FRED	No... of course not.
L355859	u1885	m123	RENEE	Was there?
L355858	u1877	m123	FRED	I thought there might be somebody inside.
L355857	u1885	m123	RENEE	Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
L355856	u1877	m123	FRED	I told you to stay in the car!
L355854	u1877	m123	FRED	He's got some fucked up friends.
L355853	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
L355852	u1877	m123	FRED	What job?
L355851	u1885	m123	RENEE	It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
L355849	u1877	m123	FRED	Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
L355848	u1885	m123	RENEE	But...
L355847	u1877	m123	FRED	Let's go home.
L355837	u1877	m123	FRED	Just a minute.
L355836	u1885	m123	RENEE	I thought you were getting me a drink?
L355815	u1885	m123	RENEE	But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
L355814	u1877	m123	FRED	I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
L355808	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
L355807	u1877	m123	FRED	Where would you feel safe?
L355799	u1885	m123	RENEE	Why would anyone do something like this?
L355798	u1877	m123	FRED	No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
L355794	u1885	m123	RENEE	On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
L355793	u1877	m123	FRED	What?
L355792	u1885	m123	RENEE	What was that?!!!
L355791	u1877	m123	FRED	I wish I knew.
L355790	u1885	m123	RENEE	What the hell is going on?!
L355787	u1877	m123	FRED	Thanks, guys.
L355786	u1885	m123	RENEE	We will.
L355748	u1885	m123	RENEE	Two detectives are coming out.
L355747	u1877	m123	FRED	So?
L355744	u1877	m123	FRED	All right.
L355743	u1885	m123	RENEE	We've got to call the police.
L355740	u1885	m123	RENEE	I guess so.
L355739	u1877	m123	FRED	Don't you want to watch it?
L355738	u1885	m123	RENEE	Yes, I just found it on the step.
L355737	u1877	m123	FRED	What's that? Another tape?
L355736	u1877	m123	FRED	Who the hell owns that dog?
L355735	u1885	m123	RENEE	That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
L355734	u1877	m123	FRED	You're up early.
L355730	u1877	m123	FRED	You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
L355729	u1885	m123	RENEE	Yeah?
L355728	u1877	m123	FRED	I had a dream about you last night...
L355726	u1877	m123	FRED	You were asleep when I got home, yes.
L355725	u1885	m123	RENEE	I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
L355724	u1877	m123	FRED	From the club. You didn't answer.
L355723	u1885	m123	RENEE	Called? When?
L355722	u1877	m123	FRED	I called, you know.
L355721	u1885	m123	RENEE	Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
L355720	u1877	m123	FRED	When you didn't come to the club.
L355719	u1885	m123	RENEE	What night?
L355718	u1877	m123	FRED	Same one you were reading the other night?
L355717	u1885	m123	RENEE	Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
L355716	u1877	m123	FRED	Good book, huh?
L355715	u1877	m123	FRED	Maybe.
L355714	u1885	m123	RENEE	It must be from a real estate agent.
L355711	u1885	m123	RENEE	No, nothing.
L355710	u1877	m123	FRED	Does it say anything on the tape?
L355709	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
L355708	u1877	m123	FRED	Who's it from?
L355707	u1885	m123	RENEE	A videotape.
L355706	u1877	m123	FRED	What's that?
L355705	u1885	m123	RENEE	Wake me up when you get home.
L355704	u1877	m123	FRED	That's why I married you.
L355703	u1885	m123	RENEE	I like to laugh, Fred.
L355702	u1877	m123	FRED	It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
L355700	u1885	m123	RENEE	I thought I'd stay home and read.
L355699	u1877	m123	FRED	What are you going to do?
L355698	u1885	m123	RENEE	You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
L355891	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
L355890	u1880	m123	MARIAN	The heart, I guess.
L355889	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
L355888	u1880	m123	MARIAN	Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
L355887	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	Which would you choose?
L355886	u1880	m123	MARIAN	Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
L355885	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	They're gonna cook him.
L355884	u1880	m123	MARIAN	How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
L355883	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
L356363	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
L356362	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah.
L356361	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
L356360	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
L356359	u1883	m123	PETE	Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
L356358	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
L356357	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.
L356356	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
L356355	u1883	m123	PETE	Mr. Eddy?
L356354	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You know who it is.
L356353	u1883	m123	PETE	Who is this?
L356352	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
L356351	u1883	m123	PETE	Hello.
L356263	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
L356262	u1883	m123	PETE	What?
L356261	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
L356260	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
L356259	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.
L356258	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	How ya doin', Pete?
L356169	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You're my man, Pete.
L356168	u1883	m123	PETE	It'll be ready.
L356167	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
L356166	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
L356165	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
L356160	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You will.
L356159	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
L356158	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Suit yourself, champ.
L356157	u1883	m123	PETE	No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
L356156	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Yeah. Give ya a boner.
L356155	u1883	m123	PETE	Pornos?
L356154	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You like pornos?
L356153	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	"No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the ""Caddy"" by tomorrow."
L356152	u1883	m123	PETE	Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
L356150	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	What'd I tell ya.
L356149	u1883	m123	PETE	Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
L356148	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	At sixty?
L356147	u1883	m123	PETE	Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
L356146	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
L356145	u1883	m123	PETE	I can see that.
L356144	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
L356130	u1883	m123	PETE	Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
L356129	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
L356128	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	All right!
L356127	u1883	m123	PETE	Give that a try.
L356123	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
L356122	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay... Lemme clear it with...
L356121	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
L356120	u1883	m123	PETE	Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
L356119	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
L356118	u1883	m123	PETE	No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
L356117	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
L356116	u1883	m123	PETE	No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
L356115	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
L356372	u1887	m123	VOICE	Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
L356371	u1883	m123	PETE	What's goin' on?
L356369	u1883	m123	PETE	What?
L356368	u1887	m123	VOICE	We just killed a couple of people...
L356367	u1883	m123	PETE	No. No, I don't.
L356366	u1887	m123	VOICE	At your house. Don't you remember?
L356365	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
L356341	u1886	m123	SHEILA	FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
L356340	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila... Stop...
L356337	u1883	m123	PETE	Go home, Sheila.
L356336	u1886	m123	SHEILA	YOU'RE SORRY!!
L356335	u1883	m123	PETE	Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
L356334	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What's the BITCH'S name?!
L356333	u1883	m123	PETE	Hey... Sheila.
L356332	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
L356331	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila...
L356330	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
L356329	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
L356229	u1883	m123	PETE	Come on.
L356228	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I didn't know you cared.
L356227	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah.
L356226	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I was?
L356225	u1883	m123	PETE	I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
L356224	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Where'd you come from?
L356176	u1883	m123	PETE	I do like you, Sheila.
L356175	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Why don't you like me?
L356173	u1883	m123	PETE	Come on... get in.
L356172	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I don't know.
L356171	u1883	m123	PETE	Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
L356170	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What do you want?
L356106	u1886	m123	SHEILA	No... I really don't want to talk about it.
L356105	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila?!
L356104	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I don't want to talk about it...
L356103	u1883	m123	PETE	Whatiya mean, Sheila?
L356102	u1886	m123	SHEILA	It was weird...
L356101	u1883	m123	PETE	No... I told you.
L356100	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You really don't remember?
L356099	u1883	m123	PETE	What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
L356098	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure. Sure I do.
L356097	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You still care about me?
L356094	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You were acting like a different person.
L356093	u1883	m123	PETE	Whatiya mean?
L356092	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
L356091	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't remember... What happened that night?
L356090	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Last time I saw you.
L356089	u1883	m123	PETE	What night?
L356088	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
L356087	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't know.
L356086	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
L356085	u1883	m123	PETE	Sorry... I...
L356084	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Why haven't you called me?
L356080	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure.
L356079	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You want some company?
L356078	u1883	m123	PETE	"Guess we're goin' over to the ""Ten Pin""."
L356077	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What are you guys doin'?
L356074	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Yeah.
L356073	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah?...
L356072	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I missed you.
L414589	u2294	m148	DR KING	Get the kit!
L414588	u2297	m148	MARGE	Oh my god, oh my god...
L414578	u2294	m148	DR KING	R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
L414577	u2297	m148	MARGE	How can you tell?
L414575	u2294	m148	DR KING	She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
L414574	u2297	m148	MARGE	What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
L414573	u2294	m148	DR KING	Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
L414572	u2297	m148	MARGE	What the hell are dreams, anyway?
L414571	u2297	m148	MARGE	Thank God.
L414570	u2294	m148	DR KING	Okay, good. She's asleep.
L414568	u2297	m148	MARGE	It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
L414567	u2294	m148	DR KING	Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
L414566	u2297	m148	MARGE	Since the murder. She was fine before that.
L414565	u2294	m148	DR KING	How long's this been going on?
L414563	u2297	m148	MARGE	Please, Nancy. Trust us.
L414562	u2294	m148	DR KING	Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
L414561	u2297	m148	MARGE	They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
L414557	u2297	m148	MARGE	I sure as hell hope so.
L414556	u2294	m148	DR KING	Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
L414554	u2297	m148	MARGE	No, nothing.
L414553	u2294	m148	DR KING	Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
L414692	u2299	m148	NANCY	Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
L414691	u2295	m148	GLEN	Meanwhile...?
L414690	u2299	m148	NANCY	You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
L414689	u2295	m148	GLEN	You crazy? Hit him with what?
L414688	u2299	m148	NANCY	You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
L414687	u2295	m148	GLEN	What!?
L414686	u2299	m148	NANCY	Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
L414685	u2295	m148	GLEN	I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
L414684	u2299	m148	NANCY	If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
L414683	u2295	m148	GLEN	Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
L414682	u2299	m148	NANCY	Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
L414681	u2295	m148	GLEN	How you plan to do that?
L414680	u2299	m148	NANCY	My dream.
L414679	u2295	m148	GLEN	Bring him out of what?
L414678	u2299	m148	NANCY	Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
L414677	u2295	m148	GLEN	Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
L414676	u2299	m148	NANCY	Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
L414675	u2295	m148	GLEN	You do?
L414674	u2299	m148	NANCY	The killer.
L414673	u2295	m148	GLEN	Who?
L414672	u2299	m148	NANCY	Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
L414671	u2295	m148	GLEN	I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
L414670	u2299	m148	NANCY	Much better.
L414668	u2295	m148	GLEN	Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
L414667	u2299	m148	NANCY	Hi.
L414666	u2295	m148	GLEN	Hello?
L414629	u2295	m148	GLEN	Well what you reading it for?
L414628	u2299	m148	NANCY	I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
L414627	u2295	m148	GLEN	'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
L414626	u2299	m148	NANCY	Great.
L414625	u2295	m148	GLEN	I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
L414624	u2299	m148	NANCY	What happens if they don't do that?
L414623	u2295	m148	GLEN	They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
L414622	u2299	m148	NANCY	And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
L414621	u2295	m148	GLEN	Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
L414620	u2299	m148	NANCY	Yeah.
L414619	u2295	m148	GLEN	They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
L414618	u2299	m148	NANCY	No.
L414617	u2295	m148	GLEN	You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
L414616	u2295	m148	GLEN	Used to. Not anymore.
L414615	u2299	m148	NANCY	And if you can't do that, you sleep.
L414614	u2295	m148	GLEN	Whenever I get nervous I eat.
L414486	u2299	m148	NANCY	Just checking -- keep out of sight!
L414485	u2295	m148	GLEN	Yeah. So?
L414483	u2299	m148	NANCY	Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
L414482	u2295	m148	GLEN	Jesus, it's dark in here.
L414479	u2295	m148	GLEN	Okay, okay.  I think.
L414478	u2299	m148	NANCY	Okay?
L414477	u2299	m148	NANCY	It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
L414476	u2295	m148	GLEN	Uh-oh...
L414475	u2299	m148	NANCY	Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
L414474	u2295	m148	GLEN	I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
L414473	u2299	m148	NANCY	You believe in anything?
L414472	u2295	m148	GLEN	One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
L414471	u2299	m148	NANCY	You believe in the Boogey Man?
L414470	u2295	m148	GLEN	No.
L414469	u2299	m148	NANCY	Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
L414468	u2295	m148	GLEN	Slept like a rock.
L414467	u2299	m148	NANCY	M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
L414464	u2299	m148	NANCY	Not really.
L414463	u2295	m148	GLEN	Haven't slept, have you?
L414462	u2299	m148	NANCY	Guess I did.
L414459	u2295	m148	GLEN	Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
L414458	u2299	m148	NANCY	Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
L414323	u2299	m148	NANCY	Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
L414322	u2295	m148	GLEN	You okay?
L414319	u2299	m148	NANCY	Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
L414318	u2295	m148	GLEN	What the hell's going on!?
L414290	u2295	m148	GLEN	Who was scary?
L414289	u2299	m148	NANCY	Because he was scary, that's why.
L414288	u2295	m148	GLEN	Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
L414287	u2299	m148	NANCY	Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
L414286	u2295	m148	GLEN	So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
L414271	u2299	m148	NANCY	Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
L414270	u2295	m148	GLEN	It's just a stupid cat.
L414250	u2295	m148	GLEN	Jesus.
L414249	u2299	m148	NANCY	Worked like a charm.
L414809	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
L414808	u2299	m148	NANCY	DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
L414767	u2299	m148	NANCY	Deal.
L414766	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
L414764	u2299	m148	NANCY	And you'll be here to catch him, right?
L414763	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
L414762	u2299	m148	NANCY	That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
L414761	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Sure, but...
L414760	u2299	m148	NANCY	-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
L414758	u2299	m148	NANCY	Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
L414757	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
L414756	u2299	m148	NANCY	Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
L414755	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Nan, I --
L414754	u2299	m148	NANCY	I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
L414752	u2299	m148	NANCY	You know he's dead though, right?
L414751	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
L414750	u2299	m148	NANCY	Hi daddy. I know what happened.
L414749	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Hello Nancy.
L414522	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
L414521	u2299	m148	NANCY	Dad -- what you doing here?
L414414	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
L414413	u2299	m148	NANCY	You don't know he did it.
L414412	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	He's dangerous.
L414411	u2299	m148	NANCY	Just want to talk to him a second.
L414410	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
L414409	u2299	m148	NANCY	Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
L414408	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Decide to take a day off after all?
L414383	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
L414382	u2299	m148	NANCY	You used me, daddy!
L414352	u2299	m148	NANCY	She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
L414351	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	What?
L414350	u2299	m148	NANCY	She dreamed this would happen...
L414345	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	You got a sane explanation for what he did?
L414344	u2299	m148	NANCY	Rod's not a lunatic.
L414342	u2299	m148	NANCY	Okay. Hi, dad.
L414341	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	How you doing, pal?
L414769	u2300	m148	PARKER	'Anything funny' like what?
L414768	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
L414748	u2300	m148	PARKER	Uh, she just saw you, sir...
L414747	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
L414337	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	I don't mean her --
L414336	u2300	m148	PARKER	She lived there.
L414335	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
L414334	u2300	m148	PARKER	Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
L414330	u2300	m148	PARKER	Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
L414329	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	What's the Coroner got to say?
L414327	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
L414326	u2300	m148	PARKER	Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
L414788	u2298	m148	MR LANTZ	Like Rod Lane?
L414787	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
L414786	u2298	m148	MR LANTZ	Maybe god's punishing us all...
L414785	u2298	m148	MR LANTZ	Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
L414784	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	How you know that?
L414783	u2298	m148	MR LANTZ	Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
L414782	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Krueger?
L414781	u2298	m148	MR LANTZ	Krueger.
L414780	u2296	m148	LT THOMPSON	Who? Who did that?
L414828	u2297	m148	MARGE	They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
L414827	u2299	m148	NANCY	Feeling better?
L414776	u2297	m148	MARGE	Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
L414775	u2299	m148	NANCY	Just sleep now, Mom.
L414774	u2297	m148	MARGE	Guess I should'n'a done it.
L414740	u2297	m148	MARGE	I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
L414739	u2299	m148	NANCY	Give me the key, mother.
L414664	u2297	m148	MARGE	Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
L414663	u2299	m148	NANCY	All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
L414654	u2299	m148	NANCY	Go on...
L414653	u2297	m148	MARGE	Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
L414649	u2299	m148	NANCY	So he's alive?
L414648	u2297	m148	MARGE	Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
L414645	u2299	m148	NANCY	I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
L414644	u2297	m148	MARGE	Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
L414643	u2299	m148	NANCY	I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
L414642	u2297	m148	MARGE	Dead and gone.
L414641	u2299	m148	NANCY	Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
L414640	u2297	m148	MARGE	S'curity.
L414639	u2299	m148	NANCY	What's with the bars?
L414611	u2297	m148	MARGE	Nancy!
L414610	u2299	m148	NANCY	Screw sleep!
L414602	u2297	m148	MARGE	Put that damned thing down!
L414601	u2299	m148	NANCY	It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
L414600	u2297	m148	MARGE	But that's just not reality, Nancy!
L414599	u2299	m148	NANCY	What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
L414598	u2297	m148	MARGE	I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
L414597	u2299	m148	NANCY	Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
L414596	u2297	m148	MARGE	I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
L414595	u2299	m148	NANCY	Go even crazier?
L414511	u2299	m148	NANCY	Okay.
L414510	u2297	m148	MARGE	Okay... You need anything, just call.
L414509	u2299	m148	NANCY	Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
L414508	u2297	m148	MARGE	You okay?
L414505	u2297	m148	MARGE	Nancy?
L414504	u2299	m148	NANCY	I must be going nuts...
L414455	u2299	m148	NANCY	Right.
L414454	u2297	m148	MARGE	Take this, it'll help you sleep.
L414453	u2299	m148	NANCY	Yes, Mother. G'night.
L414452	u2297	m148	MARGE	And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
L414451	u2299	m148	NANCY	No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
L414450	u2297	m148	MARGE	No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
L414449	u2297	m148	MARGE	To bed with you, c'mon.
L414448	u2299	m148	NANCY	Great
L414447	u2297	m148	MARGE	You okay?
L414442	u2299	m148	NANCY	Warm milk. Gross.
L414441	u2297	m148	MARGE	It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
L414440	u2299	m148	NANCY	Mother, for petesakes.
L414439	u2297	m148	MARGE	You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
L414438	u2299	m148	NANCY	What?
L414436	u2299	m148	NANCY	I will.
L414435	u2297	m148	MARGE	Get into bed.
L414434	u2299	m148	NANCY	I won't.
L414433	u2297	m148	MARGE	Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
L414366	u2299	m148	NANCY	Right home after. See you.
L414365	u2297	m148	MARGE	Right home after.
L414364	u2299	m148	NANCY	I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
L414363	u2297	m148	MARGE	Did you sleep?
L414361	u2297	m148	MARGE	I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
L414360	u2299	m148	NANCY	School.
L414359	u2297	m148	MARGE	Where you think you're going?
L414348	u2297	m148	MARGE	Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
L414347	u2299	m148	NANCY	It wasn't that serious...
L414346	u2297	m148	MARGE	Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
L414432	u2299	m148	NANCY	No.
L414431	u2301	m148	ROD	Do you think I did it?
L414428	u2301	m148	ROD	I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
L414427	u2299	m148	NANCY	What you mean 'all at once'?
L414424	u2301	m148	ROD	Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
L414423	u2299	m148	NANCY	Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
L414422	u2301	m148	ROD	No.
L414420	u2301	m148	ROD	How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
L414419	u2299	m148	NANCY	How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
L414418	u2301	m148	ROD	I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
L414417	u2299	m148	NANCY	And then what happened?
L414375	u2299	m148	NANCY	The door was locked from your side.
L414374	u2301	m148	ROD	Someone else was there.
L414373	u2299	m148	NANCY	You were screaming like crazy.
L414372	u2301	m148	ROD	I never touched her.
L414371	u2299	m148	NANCY	Nobody's gonna kill you.
L414370	u2301	m148	ROD	The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
L414369	u2299	m148	NANCY	He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
L414368	u2301	m148	ROD	Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
L414284	u2299	m148	NANCY	We should get her out of here...
L414283	u2301	m148	ROD	We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
L414260	u2299	m148	NANCY	I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
L414259	u2302	m148	TINA	What you dream?
L414254	u2302	m148	TINA	Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
L414253	u2299	m148	NANCY	Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
L414252	u2302	m148	TINA	Really. Turn 'er up a little.
L414251	u2299	m148	NANCY	Nice to have a fire.
L414241	u2299	m148	NANCY	Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
L414240	u2302	m148	TINA	I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
L414236	u2299	m148	NANCY	Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
L414235	u2302	m148	TINA	Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
L414234	u2302	m148	TINA	Yeah, nuts.
L414233	u2299	m148	NANCY	He's nuts about you.
L414232	u2302	m148	TINA	Rod says the sweetest things.
L414301	u2301	m148	ROD	Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
L414300	u2302	m148	TINA	When did you have a nightmare?
L414299	u2301	m148	ROD	Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
L414298	u2302	m148	TINA	No more fights.
L414297	u2301	m148	ROD	No more fights?
L414296	u2302	m148	TINA	Jungle man fix Jane.
L414295	u2301	m148	ROD	You feel better now, right?
L414277	u2302	m148	TINA	Of course. What's that?
L414276	u2301	m148	ROD	Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
L414275	u2302	m148	TINA	What the hell you doing here?
L439849	u2460	m158	ELLIE	He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
L439848	u2461	m158	JUD	Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
L439767	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Is that right, dad?
L439766	u2461	m158	JUD	They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
L439548	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yes--
L439547	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
L439546	u2460	m158	ELLIE	What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
L439543	u2461	m158	JUD	It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
L439542	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Well...I guess not.
L439541	u2461	m158	JUD	Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
L439532	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh.
L439531	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Bite?
L439530	u2461	m158	JUD	Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
L439512	u2461	m158	JUD	You'll see soon enough, hon.
L439511	u2460	m158	ELLIE	But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
L439464	u2461	m158	JUD	And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
L439463	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
L439462	u2461	m158	JUD	Who might you be, little Miss?
L439942	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I will. Come and kiss me.
L439941	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Please hurry.
L439921	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Of course I will.
L439920	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
L439919	u2464	m158	RACHEL	There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
L439918	u2460	m158	ELLIE	He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
L439917	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
L439916	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
L439909	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
L439908	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Ellie...Ellie...what...
L439907	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late!
L439838	u2464	m158	RACHEL	In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
L439837	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
L439574	u2460	m158	ELLIE	But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
L439573	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Honey, Church will be fine.
L439438	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yaay!
L439437	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Yes, but the rope might be--
L439434	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Am I really gonna have my own room?
L439433	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It's gorgeous!
L439903	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I swear.
L439902	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Do you swear?
L439900	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
L439899	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
L439898	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
L439851	u2460	m158	ELLIE	And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
L439850	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie--
L439808	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
L439807	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Then why do I have to go to bed?
L439806	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm sure you're not.
L439805	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I'm not tired!
L439802	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
L439801	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yeah, sure.
L439800	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
L439799	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I don't get it.
L439798	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
L439797	u2460	m158	ELLIE	You believe in it.
L439796	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
L439795	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Do you believe that?
L439794	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
L439793	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
L439792	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
L439791	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
L439790	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But don't you dare say that.
L439789	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
L439788	u2460	m158	ELLIE	At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
L439787	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
L439786	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What's up, sugar?
L439784	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
L439783	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Huh?
L439782	u2460	m158	ELLIE	No more chocolate chip cookies.
L439781	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie? What's wrong?
L439772	u2462	m158	LOUIS	That's enough, Ellen.
L439771	u2460	m158	ELLIE	She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
L439763	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I hate that smell.
L439762	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
L439759	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I know.
L439758	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Because you promised.
L439757	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439756	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Is he really all right?
L439755	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
L439754	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
L439708	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
L439707	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
L439572	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
L439571	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Good God! Where'd you hear that?
L439559	u2460	m158	ELLIE	It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
L439558	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
L439557	u2460	m158	ELLIE	In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
L439556	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
L439555	u2460	m158	ELLIE	That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
L439550	u2460	m158	ELLIE	To remember.
L439549	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
L439534	u2462	m158	LOUIS	For a little while.
L439533	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
L439529	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Well, I thought it was safe--
L439528	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
L439468	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yayyy!
L439467	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No-I guess not.
L439449	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
L439448	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
L439436	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yaay!
L439435	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439933	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't bother. I'm coming home.
L439932	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
L439931	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Was it Pascow?
L439930	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
L439929	u2461	m158	JUD	No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
L439522	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
L439521	u2464	m158	RACHEL	How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
L439466	u2461	m158	JUD	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
L439465	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
L439461	u2461	m158	JUD	No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
L439460	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
L439459	u2461	m158	JUD	Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
L439869	u2461	m158	JUD	Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
L439868	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
L439866	u2461	m158	JUD	And because the dead walked.
L439865	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
L439864	u2461	m158	JUD	I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
L439863	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
L439862	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Shit! Look at this mess!
L439861	u2461	m158	JUD	--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
L439859	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm thinking about going to bed.
L439858	u2461	m158	JUD	You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
L439857	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
L439845	u2461	m158	JUD	Louis--
L439844	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
L439843	u2461	m158	JUD	Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
L439780	u2461	m158	JUD	Nope. He's your cat now.
L439779	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's Ellie's cat.
L439778	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
L439777	u2462	m158	LOUIS	"My father used to have a saying, Jud-- ""God sees the truth, but waits."""
L439776	u2461	m158	JUD	Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
L439774	u2462	m158	LOUIS	This babe has said enough.
L439773	u2461	m158	JUD	Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
L439770	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well...a touch of the flu...
L439769	u2461	m158	JUD	Rachel not feeling well?
L439744	u2461	m158	JUD	Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
L439743	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What?
L439742	u2461	m158	JUD	A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
L439741	u2461	m158	JUD	She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
L439740	u2462	m158	LOUIS	A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
L439739	u2461	m158	JUD	Why, then, things should be fine.
L439738	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439737	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
L439735	u2461	m158	JUD	Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
L439734	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You and this old Indian rag-man--
L439732	u2461	m158	JUD	Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
L439731	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Wendigo?
L439730	u2461	m158	JUD	They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
L439728	u2461	m158	JUD	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
L439727	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Can I have another one?
L439726	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
L439725	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
L439724	u2461	m158	JUD	Wouldn't wash?
L439723	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
L439722	u2461	m158	JUD	Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
L439721	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What did we do, Jud?
L439720	u2461	m158	JUD	I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
L439704	u2461	m158	JUD	No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
L439703	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But--
L439697	u2461	m158	JUD	Because it's right.
L439696	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, why am I doing all this?
L439695	u2461	m158	JUD	Don't worry about that.
L439694	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Doesn't look like they last long.
L439693	u2461	m158	JUD	Your cairn.
L439692	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What are those for?
L439689	u2461	m158	JUD	Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
L439688	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
L439687	u2461	m158	JUD	You want to rest a bit before you start?
L439686	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I guess so...but...
L439685	u2461	m158	JUD	I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
L439684	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Why? For God's sake, why?
L439683	u2461	m158	JUD	The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
L439682	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Whose burying ground?
L439681	u2461	m158	JUD	This was their burying ground, Louis.
L439680	u2461	m158	JUD	This time I mean it.
L439679	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You keep saying that.
L439678	u2461	m158	JUD	Almost there, Louis.
L439677	u2461	m158	JUD	Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
L439676	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's funny, all right.
L439675	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You're telling me.
L439674	u2461	m158	JUD	There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
L439672	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh.
L439671	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Is there quicksand?
L439670	u2461	m158	JUD	Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
L439668	u2461	m158	JUD	You'll see before long. Let's go.
L439667	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
L439666	u2461	m158	JUD	No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
L439660	u2461	m158	JUD	Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
L439659	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm not climbing that.
L439658	u2461	m158	JUD	No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
L439657	u2462	m158	LOUIS	We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
L439656	u2461	m158	JUD	The place we're going is on the other side of that.
L439655	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What do you mean?
L439654	u2461	m158	JUD	We're still not where we're going.
L439653	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
L439652	u2461	m158	JUD	What say, Louis?
L439650	u2461	m158	JUD	Then come on.
L439649	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes, but--
L439648	u2461	m158	JUD	Does she love the cat?
L439647	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But--
L439646	u2461	m158	JUD	It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
L439645	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
L439644	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
L439643	u2461	m158	JUD	No need to apologize.
L439641	u2461	m158	JUD	Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
L439640	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't know.
L439639	u2461	m158	JUD	Going to tell Ellie?
L439638	u2461	m158	JUD	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
L439637	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Bagged cat. What a mess.
L439636	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439635	u2461	m158	JUD	Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
L439634	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
L439633	u2461	m158	JUD	I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
L439632	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's Church.
L439631	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
L439630	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
L439629	u2462	m158	LOUIS	For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
L439628	u2461	m158	JUD	Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
L439553	u2461	m158	JUD	Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
L439552	u2462	m158	LOUIS	My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
L439545	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think it is so, Ellie.
L439544	u2461	m158	JUD	No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
L439536	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
L439535	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I can hardly read these.
L439516	u2461	m158	JUD	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
L439515	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Not yet...how much further is it?
L439514	u2461	m158	JUD	Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
L439513	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
L439510	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Sure.
L439509	u2461	m158	JUD	You folks ready to go on?
L439502	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What's at the end of it?
L439501	u2461	m158	JUD	That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
L439500	u2462	m158	LOUIS	The one that goes into the woods--sure.
L439499	u2461	m158	JUD	I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
L439498	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Nice.
L439495	u2461	m158	JUD	The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
L439494	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What?
L439493	u2461	m158	JUD	Allman Brothers.
L439492	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What were you listening to?
L439491	u2461	m158	JUD	Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
L439490	u2462	m158	LOUIS	God, that's fine.
L439489	u2461	m158	JUD	Good for you.
L439488	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Not at all.
L439487	u2461	m158	JUD	You need a glass?
L439472	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, maybe I----
L439471	u2461	m158	JUD	Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
L439470	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Hey--they actually found the place!
L439914	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
L439913	u2463	m158	PASCOW	Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
L439912	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
L439747	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You don't understand--
L439746	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
L439624	u2463	m158	PASCOW	Remember.
L439623	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Leave me alone!
L439622	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
L439621	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
L439620	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
L439619	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
L439890	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm sure.
L439889	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Louis, are you sure?
L439888	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
L439887	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
L439886	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You better get going, hon.
L439819	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You're doing fine.
L439818	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm going to try to do better.
L439817	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes, I guess I do.
L439816	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
L439815	u2462	m158	LOUIS	That's forgotten.
L439814	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
L439811	u2464	m158	RACHEL	That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
L439810	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
L439809	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I heard you tonight.
L439627	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Good d--
L439626	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I got eggs down here!
L439625	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Getting there.
L439586	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
L439585	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Thank you, Louis.
L439583	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
L439582	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, honey...you know that...
L439581	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And Church will be fine.
L439580	u2464	m158	RACHEL	You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
L439579	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
L439578	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I just said--
L439577	u2464	m158	RACHEL	That's enough of that kind of talk!
L439576	u2462	m158	LOUIS	According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
L439575	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
L439565	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
L439564	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
L439563	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
L439562	u2462	m158	LOUIS	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
L439561	u2464	m158	RACHEL	She's finally asleep.
L439524	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
L439523	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think it's rather extraordinary.
L439508	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It's beautiful!
L439507	u2462	m158	LOUIS	My God!
L439483	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Did you see his shirt?
L439482	u2464	m158	RACHEL	---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
L439481	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
L439480	u2464	m158	RACHEL	You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
L439477	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
L439476	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
L439475	u2462	m158	LOUIS	The movers--
L439458	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
L439457	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Thank you. Thank you so much.
L439454	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jesus, the road!
L439453	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Gage's gone!
L439443	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Come on--let's parole 'em.
L439442	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And Buckaroo Banzai.
L439440	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Louis, the house is beautiful.
L439439	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Let her go. It's cool.
L442427	u2470	m159	JACK	Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
L442426	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	Aye, aye, sir!
L442425	u2470	m159	JACK	AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
L442088	u2470	m159	JACK	They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
L442087	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	How does he do that?
L442020	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	I will.
L442019	u2470	m159	JACK	You'll get it back.  Or one better.
L442018	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	That boat is my livelihood!
L442017	u2470	m159	JACK	Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
L442016	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
L442014	u2470	m159	JACK	AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
L442013	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	You stole my boat.
L442403	u2476	m159	WILL	He didn't waste it.
L442402	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
L442214	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
L442213	u2476	m159	WILL	No!  You gave your word!
L442208	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
L442207	u2476	m159	WILL	You must swear by the Holy Bible.
L442204	u2476	m159	WILL	And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
L442203	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	We got that part.  Anything else?
L442202	u2476	m159	WILL	Elizabeth goes free!
L442201	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Enough of that!  Name your terms.
L442194	u2476	m159	WILL	You can't.  I can.
L442193	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
L442192	u2476	m159	WILL	She.  Goes.  Free.
L442191	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	What's in your head, boy?
L442400	u2470	m159	JACK	Or you could surrender.
L442399	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
L442394	u2470	m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L442393	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
L442375	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Aye, for us there is.
L442374	u2470	m159	JACK	There's ... another exit?
L442372	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Men!  Are you up for it?
L442371	u2470	m159	JACK	Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
L442369	u2470	m159	JACK	Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
L442368	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That so?
L442367	u2470	m159	JACK	The situation has changed.
L442366	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
L442365	u2470	m159	JACK	Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
L442363	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	What're you suggesting?
L442362	u2470	m159	JACK	You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
L442357	u2470	m159	JACK	Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
L442356	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Why don't I want to do this?
L442355	u2470	m159	JACK	All right then.
L442354	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No, I really think I do.
L442226	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That's fair.
L442225	u2470	m159	JACK	You can go to your grave not knowing.
L442224	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	So how did you get off that island, anyway?
L442219	u2470	m159	JACK	The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
L442218	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You'd best take a swim, Jack.
L442217	u2470	m159	JACK	Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
L442216	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
L442215	u2470	m159	JACK	It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
L442164	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
L442163	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll watch my back.
L442162	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
L442161	u2470	m159	JACK	What -- you don't have the medallion?
L442159	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
L442158	u2470	m159	JACK	See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
L442157	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
L442155	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Track you down and --
L442154	u2470	m159	JACK	Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
L442153	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
L442152	u2470	m159	JACK	Wait as long as you like.
L442151	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
L442150	u2470	m159	JACK	You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
L442149	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I'll torture it out of you.
L442148	u2470	m159	JACK	You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
L442146	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I'm supposed to ... trust you?
L442145	u2470	m159	JACK	That's right.
L442144	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
L442143	u2470	m159	JACK	You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
L442142	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
L442141	u2470	m159	JACK	Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
L442140	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
L442137	u2470	m159	JACK	No you won't.
L442136	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Say the name, or I slit your throat.
L442135	u2470	m159	JACK	I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
L442361	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
L442360	u2474	m159	PINTEL	Do you believe him?
L442339	u2474	m159	PINTEL	I guess there is a reason to fret.
L442338	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
L442337	u2474	m159	PINTEL	No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
L442221	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
L442220	u2474	m159	PINTEL	That's proper, sir, according to the code.
L442200	u2474	m159	PINTEL	And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
L442199	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
L442139	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now.  No, don't kill him.
L442138	u2474	m159	PINTEL	Now?
L442206	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Will -- you can't trust him.
L442205	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
L442090	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
L442089	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	The curse drove you to gather this?
L441974	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
L441973	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It's a pirate medallion.
L441972	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Do you not know what this is, then?
L441971	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Would that I could.
L441970	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Then why aren't you eating?
L441969	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
L441964	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
L441963	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
L441962	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Maid or not, it fits you.
L441862	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
L441861	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Can I trust you?
L441860	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
L441859	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
L441858	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
L441857	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Thank you, sir.
L441856	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You've got sand, for a maid.
L441855	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
L441854	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You have a name, missy?
L441851	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Did you, now?
L441850	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
L441849	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
L441848	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I'll drop it!
L441847	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Very well.
L441846	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
L441845	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I want you to leave.  And never come back.
L441844	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
L441843	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
L441842	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
L442309	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
L442308	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	That would hardly be proper.
L442307	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Then I can wear men's clothing.
L442306	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
L442304	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I know where your heart truly lies.
L442303	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What?
L442302	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
L442299	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Not as a condition -- a request.
L442298	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
L442297	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
L442294	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, please!
L442293	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
L442292	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	No.  The pirates have taken Will --
L442289	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
L442288	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You're speaking up for him again?
L442287	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, you can't do that!
L442286	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
L441758	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
L441757	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
L441744	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
L441743	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
L441712	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I'm a bit nervous, myself --
L441711	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I can't breathe.
L441710	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
L441623	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Very good.
L441622	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
L441621	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Did he speak?
L441607	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
L441606	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Boy overboard!
L441605	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Man overboard!
L441597	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
L441596	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
L441650	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	About the day we met. Do you remember?
L441649	u2475	m159	SWANN	Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
L441638	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
L441637	u2475	m159	SWANN	I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
L441636	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Difficult ... to say.
L441634	u2475	m159	SWANN	Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
L441633	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I knew it.
L441632	u2475	m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
L441631	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Ceremony?
L441630	u2475	m159	SWANN	Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
L441629	u2475	m159	SWANN	Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
L441628	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
L441625	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes -- yes.
L441624	u2475	m159	SWANN	Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
L441602	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, father.
L441601	u2475	m159	SWANN	And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
L441600	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Actually, I find it all fascinating.
L441960	u2474	m159	PINTEL	He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
L441959	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
L441958	u2474	m159	PINTEL	You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
L441819	u2474	m159	PINTEL	It would appear, so do you.
L441818	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
L441817	u2474	m159	PINTEL	I know the code.
L441816	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
L441815	u2474	m159	PINTEL	What?
L442413	u2476	m159	WILL	-- but that was not a proper kiss.
L442412	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It doesn't!
L442411	u2476	m159	WILL	Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
L442410	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
L442172	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
L442171	u2476	m159	WILL	I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
L442170	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	-- then we never would have met.
L442169	u2476	m159	WILL	If I had known --
L442168	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
L442167	u2476	m159	WILL	Why would my father send this to me?
L442123	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
L442122	u2476	m159	WILL	I'm glad we got here in time.
L441653	u2476	m159	WILL	At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
L441652	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
L441651	u2476	m159	WILL	I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
L442324	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What's your plan?
L442323	u2470	m159	JACK	I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
L442322	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
L442321	u2470	m159	JACK	Exactly.
L442320	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
L442319	u2470	m159	JACK	Nor did you, I noticed.
L442318	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
L442283	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Exactly.
L442282	u2470	m159	JACK	You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
L442281	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
L442280	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
L442279	u2470	m159	JACK	Why?
L442278	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, the rum is gone.
L442277	u2470	m159	JACK	What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
L442276	u2470	m159	JACK	To the Black Pearl.
L442275	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	To freedom.
L442274	u2470	m159	JACK	We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
L442273	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
L442272	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
L442271	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
L442269	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
L442268	u2470	m159	JACK	When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
L442262	u2470	m159	JACK	More to drink!
L442261	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
L442260	u2470	m159	JACK	Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
L442259	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	That was before I met one, of course.
L442258	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
L442257	u2470	m159	JACK	I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
L442256	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
L442255	u2470	m159	JACK	What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
L442254	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
L442251	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Not when you can drink instead, at least.
L442250	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
L442249	u2470	m159	JACK	You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
L442248	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
L442247	u2470	m159	JACK	You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
L442246	u2470	m159	JACK	Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
L442245	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
L442244	u2470	m159	JACK	Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
L442243	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	But ... you did it before!  Last time --
L442242	u2470	m159	JACK	It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
L442241	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
L442239	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
L442238	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
L442235	u2470	m159	JACK	The trees are taller.
L442234	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Has it changed since the last time you were here?
L442126	u2470	m159	JACK	No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
L442125	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Come on!
L442118	u2470	m159	JACK	No, I'm -- rescuing you.
L442117	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You're in league with Barbossa!
L442116	u2470	m159	JACK	Me!
L442115	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You?!
L441755	u2470	m159	JACK	I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
L441754	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You are despicable.
L441752	u2470	m159	JACK	Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
L441751	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Miss Swann.
L442078	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
L442077	u2468	m159	GIBBS	How did you get off the island?
L442059	u2470	m159	JACK	We're catching up!
L442058	u2468	m159	GIBBS	What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
L442057	u2470	m159	JACK	She can hold a bit longer.
L442056	u2468	m159	GIBBS	We'd best drop canvas, sir!
L442044	u2470	m159	JACK	That he is.
L442043	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
L442040	u2468	m159	GIBBS	And you've got that, have you?
L442039	u2470	m159	JACK	Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
L442038	u2468	m159	GIBBS	A fool's errand.
L442037	u2470	m159	JACK	Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
L442036	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
L442035	u2470	m159	JACK	I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
L442034	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Say again?
L442032	u2470	m159	JACK	Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
L442031	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
L442030	u2470	m159	JACK	First -- have you found me a crew?
L442029	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
L442025	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Aye, that'll about do it.
L442024	u2470	m159	JACK	Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
L442023	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
L442188	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
L442187	u2476	m159	WILL	We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
L442186	u2468	m159	GIBBS	That we are.
L442185	u2476	m159	WILL	We're not going to just surrender!
L442184	u2468	m159	GIBBS	It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
L442074	u2476	m159	WILL	How did he get off the island?
L442073	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
L442072	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
L442071	u2476	m159	WILL	What?  He never told me that.
L442070	u2468	m159	GIBBS	I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
L442069	u2476	m159	WILL	Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
L442068	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
L442067	u2476	m159	WILL	How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
L442027	u2476	m159	WILL	I know.  That was for the smell.
L442026	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Blast it, I'm already awake!
L442422	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I don't think that will be necessary.
L442421	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
L442384	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
L442383	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
L441952	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
L441951	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
L441950	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
L441949	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
L441948	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Raise the sails.
L441927	u2470	m159	JACK	As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
L441926	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
L441925	u2470	m159	JACK	Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
L441924	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
L441923	u2470	m159	JACK	We'll see about that.
L441922	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
L441921	u2470	m159	JACK	Dead serious.
L441702	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	I said, no lies.
L441701	u2470	m159	JACK	None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
L441698	u2470	m159	JACK	Smith.
L441697	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	What's your name?
L441676	u2470	m159	JACK	That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
L441675	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
L441674	u2470	m159	JACK	That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
L441668	u2470	m159	JACK	This must be some important boat.
L441667	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
L441666	u2470	m159	JACK	Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
L441665	u2470	m159	JACK	Sorry, I didn't know.
L441664	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	This dock is off-limits to civilians.
L442336	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
L442335	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I'll be at the wheel myself.
L442334	u2470	m159	JACK	That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
L442333	u2470	m159	JACK	I knew you'd listen to reason!
L442332	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
L442331	u2470	m159	JACK	They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
L442330	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You would do that?
L442329	u2470	m159	JACK	Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
L442328	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
L442296	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
L442295	u2470	m159	JACK	Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
L442291	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
L442290	u2470	m159	JACK	We had time to get to know each other.
L441746	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Indeed.
L441745	u2470	m159	JACK	But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
L441741	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, but you have heard of me.
L441740	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
L441733	u2470	m159	JACK	Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
L441732	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
L442405	u2470	m159	JACK	The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
L442404	u2476	m159	WILL	Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
L442359	u2470	m159	JACK	-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
L442358	u2476	m159	WILL	Jack!
L442348	u2470	m159	JACK	It's the right way.
L442347	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you certain this is the right way?
L442346	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
L442345	u2476	m159	WILL	Jack!
L442344	u2470	m159	JACK	Do you have any idea where you're going?
L442197	u2476	m159	WILL	My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
L442196	u2470	m159	JACK	Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
L442131	u2470	m159	JACK	I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
L442130	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
L442129	u2470	m159	JACK	Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
L442128	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll lead them away.
L442127	u2476	m159	WILL	No.
L442121	u2470	m159	JACK	This way!
L442120	u2476	m159	WILL	Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
L442094	u2470	m159	JACK	On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
L442093	u2476	m159	WILL	On what?
L442092	u2470	m159	JACK	Depends.
L442091	u2476	m159	WILL	What's that?
L442082	u2476	m159	WILL	Barbossa.
L442081	u2470	m159	JACK	But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
L442080	u2470	m159	JACK	The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
L442079	u2476	m159	WILL	Wait -- what about the pistol?
L442054	u2470	m159	JACK	These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
L442053	u2476	m159	WILL	Shut up, before you lose them all!
L442012	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
L442011	u2476	m159	WILL	Just do it quickly.
L442009	u2470	m159	JACK	Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
L442008	u2476	m159	WILL	Tortuga?
L442005	u2470	m159	JACK	Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
L442004	u2476	m159	WILL	You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
L442003	u2470	m159	JACK	Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
L442002	u2476	m159	WILL	My father -- was not -- a pirate!
L442001	u2470	m159	JACK	Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
L442000	u2476	m159	WILL	My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
L441999	u2470	m159	JACK	You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
L441998	u2476	m159	WILL	He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
L441997	u2470	m159	JACK	Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
L441996	u2476	m159	WILL	It's not true my father was a pirate.
L441995	u2470	m159	JACK	I swear, you look just like him.
L441994	u2476	m159	WILL	That's not true.
L441993	u2470	m159	JACK	Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
L441992	u2476	m159	WILL	'Bootstrap?'
L441991	u2470	m159	JACK	I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
L441989	u2476	m159	WILL	My father.  William Turner?
L441988	u2470	m159	JACK	Is that so?
L441987	u2476	m159	WILL	I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
L441986	u2470	m159	JACK	For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
L441919	u2476	m159	WILL	Aye!  Avast!
L441918	u2470	m159	JACK	Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
L441917	u2470	m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L441916	u2476	m159	WILL	This is either crazy, or brilliant.
L441915	u2470	m159	JACK	So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
L441914	u2476	m159	WILL	It's still against the law.
L441913	u2470	m159	JACK	Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
L441912	u2476	m159	WILL	We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
L441910	u2470	m159	JACK	No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
L441909	u2476	m159	WILL	I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
L441908	u2470	m159	JACK	Come aboard.
L441905	u2470	m159	JACK	Good.
L441904	u2476	m159	WILL	I'd die for her.
L441903	u2470	m159	JACK	My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
L441902	u2476	m159	WILL	Why are brothering with that?
L441901	u2476	m159	WILL	We need to go!
L441900	u2470	m159	JACK	Not without my effects.
L441898	u2470	m159	JACK	Agreed!
L441897	u2476	m159	WILL	Agreed.
L441893	u2476	m159	WILL	I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
L441892	u2470	m159	JACK	How?  The key's run off.
L441891	u2476	m159	WILL	I can get you out of here.
L441890	u2470	m159	JACK	So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
L441889	u2476	m159	WILL	Never.  They took Miss Swann.
L441888	u2470	m159	JACK	And you want to turn pirate yourself?
L441887	u2476	m159	WILL	Because you're a pirate.
L441886	u2470	m159	JACK	Why ask me?
L441885	u2476	m159	WILL	The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
L441884	u2470	m159	JACK	Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
L441883	u2476	m159	WILL	Where does it make berth?
L441882	u2470	m159	JACK	Somewhat.
L441881	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
L441783	u2476	m159	WILL	No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
L441782	u2470	m159	JACK	Move!
L441781	u2476	m159	WILL	No.
L441780	u2470	m159	JACK	Move away.
L441779	u2470	m159	JACK	Pirate.
L441778	u2476	m159	WILL	You cheated.
L441776	u2470	m159	JACK	You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
L441775	u2476	m159	WILL	I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
L441774	u2470	m159	JACK	Who makes all these?
L441769	u2470	m159	JACK	Only a little.
L441768	u2476	m159	WILL	You threatened Miss Swann.
L441767	u2470	m159	JACK	Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
L441766	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
L441765	u2476	m159	WILL	I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
L441764	u2470	m159	JACK	You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
L441874	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Still --
L441873	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Mentioned it, is more what he did.
L441872	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
L441706	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
L441705	u2471	m159	MULLROY	He may be.
L441704	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	He's not telling the truth.
L441703	u2471	m159	MULLROY	I think he's telling the truth.
L441700	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	And no lies!
L441699	u2471	m159	MULLROY	What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
L441693	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
L441692	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	... no.
L441691	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
L441690	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	But I've seen a ship with black sails.
L441689	u2471	m159	MULLROY	No.
L441688	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	... No.
L441687	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
L441686	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes, I have.
L441685	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You haven't seen it.
L441684	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
L441683	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen the Black Pearl?
L441682	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
L441681	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen it?
L441680	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes it is.  I've seen it.
L441679	u2471	m159	MULLROY	No, it's not.
L441678	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	The Black Pearl is a real ship.
L441677	u2471	m159	MULLROY	There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
L441938	u2475	m159	SWANN	Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
L441937	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Please.
L441936	u2475	m159	SWANN	But --
L441935	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	A moment.
L441934	u2475	m159	SWANN	Commodore --
L441796	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Bleak.  Very bleak.
L441795	u2475	m159	SWANN	Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
L441794	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	No.  She hasn't.
L441793	u2475	m159	SWANN	Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
L441612	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
L441611	u2475	m159	SWANN	What happened here?
L441609	u2475	m159	SWANN	Where did he come from?
L441608	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	He's still breathing.
L441599	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	My apologies, Governor.
L441598	u2475	m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
L496342	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
L496341	u2685	m174	RADEAU	That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
L496340	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Yeah ?- sure.
L496339	u2685	m174	RADEAU	Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
L496338	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Sure I do.
L496337	u2685	m174	RADEAU	You know who I am, August?
L496403	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Listen ??
L496402	u2675	m174	MARY	You could go and open the door.
L496401	u2667	m174	AUGUST	We can't stand here all night.
L496400	u2675	m174	MARY	No.
L496399	u2667	m174	AUGUST	I'd like to get out of here.
L496398	u2675	m174	MARY	It's only a little way, Mr. August.
L496396	u2675	m174	MARY	No.
L496395	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Let's get out of here.
L496394	u2675	m174	MARY	Yes.
L496393	u2667	m174	AUGUST	You scared?
L496392	u2667	m174	AUGUST	It's the last door at the end of this hall.
L496391	u2675	m174	MARY	Which room is it?
L496390	u2667	m174	AUGUST	I don't like this.
L496389	u2667	m174	AUGUST	I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
L496388	u2675	m174	MARY	If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
L496387	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
L496386	u2675	m174	MARY	Can we go there now?
L496385	u2667	m174	AUGUST	You can't tell.
L496384	u2675	m174	MARY	You think my sister is there?
L496382	u2675	m174	MARY	Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
L496381	u2667	m174	AUGUST	That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
L496380	u2675	m174	MARY	Yes. She bought my sister's business.
L496379	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
L496378	u2675	m174	MARY	Where?
L496377	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
L496376	u2675	m174	MARY	Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
L496375	u2667	m174	AUGUST	I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
L496335	u2675	m174	MARY	I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
L496334	u2667	m174	AUGUST	Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
L496333	u2675	m174	MARY	You can?
L496332	u2667	m174	AUGUST	The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
L496953	u2668	m174	BRUNS	You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
L496952	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	No.
L496951	u2668	m174	BRUNS	Drink.
L496950	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
L496937	u2668	m174	BRUNS	It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
L496936	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	When I wanted to.
L496933	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	No.
L496932	u2668	m174	BRUNS	Then, you also understand that you must die.
L496931	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	Yes, I understand.
L496930	u2668	m174	BRUNS	The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
L496446	u2678	m174	MISS SUMMERS	No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
L496445	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
L496444	u2678	m174	MISS SUMMERS	I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
L496443	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	Yes.
L496442	u2678	m174	MISS SUMMERS	Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
L496440	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	Thank you.
L496439	u2678	m174	MISS SUMMERS	Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
L496478	u2671	m174	GREGORY	What circumstances?
L496477	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
L496476	u2671	m174	GREGORY	But tell me --
L496475	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	Oh, as beautiful as ever.
L496474	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
L496473	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	For the time being, I imagine that must do.
L496472	u2671	m174	GREGORY	About forty-five dollars.
L496471	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	How much have you got?
L496470	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I haven't got that much in cash.
L496469	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	She can only use cash.
L496468	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I'll give you a check.
L496467	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	She could use a hundred dollars.
L496466	u2671	m174	GREGORY	How much does she want?
L496464	u2671	m174	GREGORY	But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
L496463	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
L496462	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	As a man, you distrust me ?- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
L496461	u2671	m174	GREGORY	It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
L496460	u2671	m174	GREGORY	You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
L496459	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
L496456	u2671	m174	GREGORY	What sort of danger?
L496455	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
L496454	u2671	m174	GREGORY	If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
L496453	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
L496452	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
L496451	u2669	m174	DR. JUDD	I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
L496690	u2675	m174	MARY	What is it?
L496689	u2670	m174	FRANCES	I ought to know.
L496688	u2675	m174	MARY	Do you know what this is, Frances?
L496687	u2675	m174	MARY	Thank you.
L496686	u2670	m174	FRANCES	The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
L496683	u2670	m174	FRANCES	I guess most people are.
L496682	u2675	m174	MARY	It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
L496681	u2675	m174	MARY	What does she do with herself after business hours?
L496680	u2670	m174	FRANCES	She's a pretty good sort.
L496679	u2675	m174	MARY	She seems rather an odd woman to me.
L496678	u2670	m174	FRANCES	Redi's all right.
L496677	u2675	m174	MARY	Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
L496676	u2670	m174	FRANCES	Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
L496675	u2675	m174	MARY	But I like teaching school.
L496674	u2670	m174	FRANCES	I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
L496285	u2675	m174	MARY	I'll try there.
L496284	u2670	m174	FRANCES	It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
L496283	u2675	m174	MARY	The Dante?
L496281	u2675	m174	MARY	I can't understand it at all.
L496280	u2670	m174	FRANCES	Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
L496279	u2675	m174	MARY	I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
L496278	u2670	m174	FRANCES	I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -? had your picture in her office.
L496277	u2670	m174	FRANCES	You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
L496276	u2675	m174	MARY	I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
L496275	u2670	m174	FRANCES	How's Miss Jacqueline?
L496274	u2675	m174	MARY	Hello, Frances.
L496273	u2670	m174	FRANCES	Why, Mary --
L496762	u2670	m174	FRANCES	Yes.
L496761	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
L496705	u2670	m174	FRANCES	She showed me a drawing.
L496704	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	What did she want to know?
L496703	u2670	m174	FRANCES	No. She asked about the trademark.
L496702	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	And that was all?
L496701	u2670	m174	FRANCES	She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
L496700	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
L496699	u2670	m174	FRANCES	Nothing.
L496698	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	What were you talking about?
L496697	u2670	m174	FRANCES	I did her hair.
L496696	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	What did she want?
L497015	u2675	m174	MARY	No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
L497014	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I know ?? I shouldn't have told you?
L497013	u2675	m174	MARY	I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -? you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister ?? whom I had lost and have found again....   
L497012	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
L497011	u2675	m174	MARY	Yes.
L497010	u2671	m174	GREGORY	No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -? you know that?
L497008	u2671	m174	GREGORY	It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
L497007	u2675	m174	MARY	Gregory ??  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
L497006	u2671	m174	GREGORY	That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
L496886	u2675	m174	MARY	Good night.
L496885	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
L496877	u2675	m174	MARY	You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
L496876	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
L496875	u2675	m174	MARY	It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
L496874	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
L496873	u2675	m174	MARY	Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
L496812	u2675	m174	MARY	We've tried so long to find her.
L496811	u2671	m174	GREGORY	She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
L496560	u2675	m174	MARY	What things? Why?
L496559	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
L496558	u2675	m174	MARY	You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
L496551	u2675	m174	MARY	A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table ?? the one at the feet of Dante.
L496550	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Who the devil is he?
L496549	u2675	m174	MARY	Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
L496548	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Please ?- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
L496496	u2671	m174	GREGORY	There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
L496495	u2675	m174	MARY	Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
L496494	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
L496493	u2675	m174	MARY	You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
L496492	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Oh, I'm making investigations.
L496491	u2675	m174	MARY	 What have you done about Irving August?
L496483	u2675	m174	MARY	Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
L496482	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -?
L496481	u2675	m174	MARY	What brought you down here, Greg?
L496437	u2675	m174	MARY	Yes.
L496436	u2671	m174	GREGORY	The people at the restaurant?
L496435	u2675	m174	MARY	Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
L496434	u2671	m174	GREGORY	It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
L496433	u2675	m174	MARY	I'd like that.
L496432	u2671	m174	GREGORY	You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
L496431	u2675	m174	MARY	A job?
L496430	u2671	m174	GREGORY	However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
L496429	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
L496428	u2675	m174	MARY	But you have treated me that way.
L496427	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
L496425	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Drink your milk.
L496424	u2675	m174	MARY	He was a kind little man in his way ?? and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
L496423	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Yes, of course ?? but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
L496422	u2675	m174	MARY	I saw him on the floor. He was cut -?  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him ?? white ?? and the men holding him up between them.
L496421	u2671	m174	GREGORY	The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
L496420	u2675	m174	MARY	But you do believe me?
L496419	u2671	m174	GREGORY	This is about another murder ?? a woman at Fifty Second Street
L496374	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Goodnight, Mary.
L496373	u2675	m174	MARY	Thank you.. .goodnight.
L496372	u2671	m174	GREGORY	You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
L496371	u2675	m174	MARY	But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
L496370	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Good.
L496369	u2675	m174	MARY	Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
L496365	u2675	m174	MARY	I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
L496364	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -? I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her ?? to see her ?? to touch her ?? in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
L496363	u2675	m174	MARY	Weren't you afraid?
L496362	u2671	m174	GREGORY	At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life ?? that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
L496361	u2675	m174	MARY	Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ??frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -? waiting ?? I feel as if I'd never known her.
L496360	u2671	m174	GREGORY	A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -? something you never get hold of ?- something that keeps a man following after her.
L496358	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
L496357	u2675	m174	MARY	Why?
L496356	u2671	m174	GREGORY	But I'd give a great deal to know.
L496355	u2675	m174	MARY	Then you know where Jacqueline is?
L496354	u2671	m174	GREGORY	The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
L496353	u2675	m174	MARY	No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
L496352	u2671	m174	GREGORY	We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
L496892	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Not from me.
L496891	u2673	m174	JASON	She'll have to know some time.
L496890	u2673	m174	JASON	That you love Mary.
L496889	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Let her know what?
L496823	u2673	m174	JASON	Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
L496822	u2671	m174	GREGORY	What's that?
L496819	u2673	m174	JASON	I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
L496818	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Could you find him?
L496817	u2673	m174	JASON	We could tell him.
L496816	u2671	m174	GREGORY	He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want ?- surrender herself to the police ?? stand trial ?? I don't think he knows.
L496815	u2673	m174	JASON	I don't know.
L496814	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Do you think he knows about this?
L496584	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Well, that's illuminating.
L496583	u2673	m174	JASON	I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
L496582	u2671	m174	GREGORY	All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
L496581	u2673	m174	JASON	This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
L496580	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Well?
L496576	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
L496575	u2673	m174	JASON	Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
L496574	u2671	m174	GREGORY	It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
L496573	u2673	m174	JASON	But I understand her. That may be more important.
L496572	u2671	m174	GREGORY	You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
L496571	u2673	m174	JASON	But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
L496570	u2671	m174	GREGORY	Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
L496569	u2673	m174	JASON	But I'm not joking.
L496568	u2671	m174	GREGORY	I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
L496567	u2673	m174	JASON	I'm going to find your sister.
L497004	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	You will die.
L497003	u2676	m174	MIMI	I don't know.
L497002	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	And then?
L497001	u2676	m174	MIMI	I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
L497000	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	Why wait?
L496999	u2676	m174	MIMI	I'm tired of being afraid -? of waiting.
L496998	u2676	m174	MIMI	I'm afraid.
L496997	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
L496996	u2676	m174	MIMI	Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -?closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
L496995	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	No!
L496994	u2676	m174	MIMI	I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
L496993	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	Who are you?
L496900	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	Yes.
L496899	u2675	m174	MARY	You'll be all right?
L496898	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	I won't get lonely.
L496897	u2675	m174	MARY	If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
L496896	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	Good-bye.
L496895	u2675	m174	MARY	Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
L496868	u2672	m174	JACQUELINE	You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
L496867	u2675	m174	MARY	Please, Jacqueline.
L497022	u2673	m174	JASON	Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -? you're off to work.
L497021	u2675	m174	MARY	I understand.
L497020	u2673	m174	JASON	"Not I ?- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -? ""My courage like a white plume"" ? and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,"
L497017	u2675	m174	MARY	I keep telling myself that.
L497016	u2673	m174	JASON	I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
L496966	u2673	m174	JASON	They may have been friends of hers.
L496965	u2675	m174	MARY	Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
L496964	u2673	m174	JASON	What's wrong, Mary?
L496963	u2675	m174	MARY	I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
L496808	u2675	m174	MARY	He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
L496807	u2673	m174	JASON	He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
L496806	u2675	m174	MARY	And Gregory -- he loves her.
L496805	u2673	m174	JASON	If it is true ? there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
L496804	u2675	m174	MARY	I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -? it fits in with what I saw -? she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
L496803	u2673	m174	JASON	And you believe that?
L496802	u2675	m174	MARY	Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
L496801	u2673	m174	JASON	You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
L496800	u2675	m174	MARY	It's because of Jacqueline ?? I can't go on looking for her --
L496799	u2673	m174	JASON	I had begun to write again -?that's whet I was doing when you came in.
L496798	u2673	m174	JASON	I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
L496797	u2675	m174	MARY	Don't make me tell you, Jason.
L496796	u2673	m174	JASON	"It isn't that -- you said, ""have to go."" What could compel you --"
L496795	u2673	m174	JASON	But you're happy here -- you like your work ?-
L496794	u2675	m174	MARY	I have to go ?-
L496793	u2673	m174	JASON	I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me ?-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
L496792	u2675	m174	MARY	Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
L496791	u2673	m174	JASON	It's not a searchlight ?? it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince ?- not stars --
L496790	u2675	m174	MARY	It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
L496789	u2673	m174	JASON	My window - - through which I see the world.
L496786	u2673	m174	JASON	It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it ?? to know me better.
L496785	u2675	m174	MARY	But it's a small room, Jason.
L496784	u2673	m174	JASON	I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
L496672	u2673	m174	JASON	Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
L496671	u2675	m174	MARY	I can imagine.
L496670	u2673	m174	JASON	Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
L496669	u2675	m174	MARY	Devil worshippers!
L496668	u2673	m174	JASON	I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
L496667	u2675	m174	MARY	It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
L496666	u2673	m174	JASON	Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
L496665	u2675	m174	MARY	I'm at sea, Jason.
L496664	u2673	m174	JASON	"That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked ""perfect"" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since."
L496663	u2675	m174	MARY	I don't know.
L496662	u2673	m174	JASON	But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
L496661	u2675	m174	MARY	I don't think that's so revealing.
L496660	u2673	m174	JASON	I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
L496659	u2675	m174	MARY	But you're always at the library.
L496658	u2673	m174	JASON	I have been at the library.
L496652	u2673	m174	JASON	I have something even better.
L496651	u2675	m174	MARY	It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
L496634	u2675	m174	MARY	I want you to look for Jacqueline.
L496633	u2673	m174	JASON	Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
L496632	u2675	m174	MARY	And you knew he'd be here.
L496631	u2673	m174	JASON	Yes.
L496630	u2675	m174	MARY	At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
L496566	u2673	m174	JASON	You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
L496565	u2675	m174	MARY	"Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- ""your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."""
L496315	u2673	m174	JASON	Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
L496314	u2675	m174	MARY	Were you going to make a suggestion?
L496557	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
L496556	u2673	m174	JASON	We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything ?? and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
L496555	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one ? so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -? he doesn't make her laugh ?? he just sits and talks.
L496545	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
L496544	u2673	m174	JASON	What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
L496541	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	Jason, my pet ??
L496317	u2673	m174	JASON	I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
L496316	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
L496648	u2677	m174	MISS GOTTSCHALK	Well, since, you're over twenty one??
L496647	u2673	m174	JASON	I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
L496646	u2677	m174	MISS GOTTSCHALK	Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
L496645	u2677	m174	MISS GOTTSCHALK	No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
L496644	u2673	m174	JASON	Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
L496643	u2677	m174	MISS GOTTSCHALK	It's here, too.
L496642	u2673	m174	JASON	Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
L496641	u2677	m174	MISS GOTTSCHALK	And the other was Judd?
L496639	u2677	m174	MISS GOTTSCHALK	Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
L496638	u2673	m174	JASON	I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
L496637	u2677	m174	MISS GOTTSCHALK	Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
L496969	u2674	m174	JUDD	They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -? this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
L496968	u2673	m174	JASON	What?
L496961	u2673	m174	JASON	I'd like that.
L496960	u2674	m174	JUDD	If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
L496946	u2673	m174	JASON	It might have.
L496945	u2674	m174	JUDD	A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
L496944	u2673	m174	JASON	She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
L496943	u2674	m174	JUDD	I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
L496894	u2673	m174	JASON	Perhaps
L496893	u2674	m174	JUDD	I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
L496888	u2673	m174	JASON	I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
L496887	u2674	m174	JUDD	I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
L496848	u2674	m174	JUDD	I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
L496847	u2673	m174	JASON	Perhaps.
L496846	u2674	m174	JUDD	No other reason ?? no woman ??not the little Miss Gibson?
L496845	u2673	m174	JASON	I think it's time.
L496844	u2674	m174	JUDD	Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish ? to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
L496843	u2673	m174	JASON	You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -? when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
L496842	u2674	m174	JUDD	Tell me what?
L496841	u2673	m174	JASON	Yes. When I tell you.
L496840	u2674	m174	JUDD	You don't expect me to do that do you?
L496839	u2673	m174	JASON	Tell me where Jacqueline is -? we've got to find her.
L496838	u2674	m174	JUDD	I'd forgotten.
L496837	u2673	m174	JASON	Wait ?- there is that other favor.
L496836	u2673	m174	JASON	Why not let your publisher judge that?
L496835	u2674	m174	JUDD	I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
L496834	u2673	m174	JASON	It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
L496833	u2674	m174	JUDD	And this poetry ?? like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
L496832	u2673	m174	JASON	I should like people to read what I've written.
L496831	u2674	m174	JUDD	This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe?laces; now this sudden humility.
L496829	u2674	m174	JUDD	It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
L496827	u2674	m174	JUDD	Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
L496826	u2673	m174	JASON	Uh?huh.
L496825	u2674	m174	JUDD	Following me to find Jacqueline?
L496616	u2674	m174	JUDD	After that wonderful first book ?- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
L496615	u2673	m174	JASON	I've lost my knack.
L496614	u2674	m174	JUDD	I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
L496613	u2673	m174	JASON	I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
L496612	u2674	m174	JUDD	What was she to you?
L496611	u2674	m174	JUDD	She was my patient.
L496610	u2673	m174	JASON	Because there was another girl? years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -? I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
L496609	u2674	m174	JUDD	But why come to me?
L496608	u2673	m174	JASON	See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
L496606	u2674	m174	JUDD	My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
L496605	u2673	m174	JASON	I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
L496604	u2674	m174	JUDD	What a peculiar question.
L496603	u2673	m174	JASON	Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
L496971	u2674	m174	JUDD	I don't know.
L496970	u2675	m174	MARY	Would they hurt her?
L496879	u2675	m174	MARY	It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
L496878	u2674	m174	JUDD	Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
L496520	u2674	m174	JUDD	Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
L496519	u2675	m174	MARY	Cloven hoof?
L496518	u2674	m174	JUDD	It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
L496517	u2674	m174	JUDD	If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
L496516	u2675	m174	MARY	You know where she is?
L496515	u2674	m174	JUDD	Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
L496514	u2674	m174	JUDD	Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
L496513	u2675	m174	MARY	Dr. Judd?
L496918	u2674	m174	JUDD	No, she's with her sister,
L496917	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it ?? your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
L496916	u2674	m174	JUDD	And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -?will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
L496915	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
L496914	u2674	m174	JUDD	I'm very, very serious.
L496913	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
L496911	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
L496910	u2674	m174	JUDD	I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
L496909	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	I never thought you did.
L496908	u2674	m174	JUDD	But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
L496907	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
L496906	u2674	m174	JUDD	I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
L496905	u2674	m174	JUDD	No. She's no longer under my care.
L496904	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	Is it about Jacqueline?
L496731	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
L496730	u2674	m174	JUDD	It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
L496729	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
L496728	u2674	m174	JUDD	Unless what?
L496727	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
L496726	u2674	m174	JUDD	A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
L496725	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	I was a great dancer...
L496722	u2674	m174	JUDD	I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
L496721	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
L496720	u2674	m174	JUDD	I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
L496719	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
L496718	u2674	m174	JUDD	But you would like to know where she is?
L496717	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	I haven't said anything of the sort.
L496716	u2674	m174	JUDD	Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
L496715	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
L496714	u2674	m174	JUDD	I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
L496713	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
L496712	u2674	m174	JUDD	I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice ?? that's it, isn't it?
L496711	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	It seems right to us.
L496710	u2674	m174	JUDD	I'd hardly describe It that way ?- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
L496709	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	One believes -? it's like any other religion...
L496708	u2674	m174	JUDD	I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
L496746	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
L496745	u2675	m174	MARY	I don't believe it.
L496744	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
L496743	u2675	m174	MARY	I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
L496742	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
L496741	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
L496740	u2675	m174	MARY	Why?
L496739	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
L496738	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
L496737	u2675	m174	MARY	I'll be out in a minute.
L496736	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
L496735	u2675	m174	MARY	Yes.
L496695	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	That's too bad.
L496694	u2675	m174	MARY	I'm afraid not.
L496272	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Thank you, my dear.
L496271	u2675	m174	MARY	I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
L496270	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
L496269	u2675	m174	MARY	There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
L496268	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Yes ?? and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
L496267	u2675	m174	MARY	I didn't know.
L496266	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
L496265	u2675	m174	MARY	Mrs. Redi, there's one thing ?-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
L496263	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I'm afraid not.
L496262	u2675	m174	MARY	But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
L496302	u2675	m174	MARY	Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
L496301	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
L496300	u2675	m174	MARY	You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
L496299	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
L496298	u2675	m174	MARY	But she was here?
L496297	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	She's not been here for a long time.
L496296	u2675	m174	MARY	Yes ?? yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
L496293	u2683	m174	MRS. ROMARI	Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna ?-
L496292	u2675	m174	MARY	Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
L496252	u2681	m174	MRS. LOWOOD	I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
L496251	u2675	m174	MARY	But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
L496249	u2675	m174	MARY	Of course.
L496248	u2681	m174	MRS. LOWOOD	I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
L496247	u2675	m174	MARY	Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
L496246	u2681	m174	MRS. LOWOOD	We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
L496245	u2675	m174	MARY	Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
L496244	u2681	m174	MRS. LOWOOD	That makes it all the more difficult ??
L496242	u2681	m174	MRS. LOWOOD	Have you any other relatives, Mary?
L496241	u2675	m174	MARY	No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
L496240	u2681	m174	MRS. LOWOOD	Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
L496307	u2675	m174	MARY	What did he say?
L496306	u2686	m174	ROMARI	Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
L496304	u2675	m174	MARY	Please.
L496303	u2686	m174	ROMARI	No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
L496290	u2675	m174	MARY	She's very beautiful.
L496289	u2686	m174	ROMARI	I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
L496288	u2675	m174	MARY	I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
L496287	u2686	m174	ROMARI	Yes?
L496286	u2675	m174	MARY	I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
L496929	u2684	m174	NANCY	When?
L496928	u2675	m174	MARY	I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
L496927	u2684	m174	NANCY	What?
L496926	u2675	m174	MARY	Because I have something very important to do.
L496925	u2684	m174	NANCY	Why
L496924	u2675	m174	MARY	Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
L496497	u2684	m174	NANCY	Is it fifteen minutes yet?
L496490	u2675	m174	MARY	Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
L496489	u2684	m174	NANCY	Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
L496780	u2679	m174	MR. BRUNS	Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
L496779	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
L496776	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	What about Judd -- he knows about us.
L496775	u2679	m174	MR. BRUNS	It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
L496772	u2679	m174	MR. BRUNS	I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
L496771	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
L496766	u2679	m174	MR. BRUNS	"I can quote that too; ""Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."""
L496765	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	But he also wrote --
L496764	u2679	m174	MR. BRUNS	"I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. ""We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."""
L496763	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
L496939	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	It won't hurt.
L496938	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
L496935	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
L496934	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
L496752	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I should have known. She had no sincerity ?- no real belief.
L496751	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell ?-
L496750	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
L496748	u2680	m174	MRS. CORTEZ	We haven't even begun tea yet.
L496747	u2682	m174	MRS. REDI	I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
L503325	u2696	m176	BETTS	Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
L503324	u2701	m176	JANINE	Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
L503211	u2696	m176	BETTS	Was he nice to you?
L503210	u2701	m176	JANINE	No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
L503209	u2696	m176	BETTS	Hi. Want a drink?
L503208	u2701	m176	JANINE	Hi.
L503158	u2696	m176	BETTS	So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
L503157	u2701	m176	JANINE	He'll be really mad.
L503156	u2696	m176	BETTS	Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
L503155	u2701	m176	JANINE	He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
L503154	u2696	m176	BETTS	...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
L503221	u2697	m176	BOY	Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
L503220	u2700	m176	GIRL	Jesus!
L503218	u2700	m176	GIRL	With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
L503217	u2697	m176	BOY	Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
L503216	u2700	m176	GIRL	OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
L503215	u2697	m176	BOY	I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
L503214	u2700	m176	GIRL	C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
L503115	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	He sounded fine.
L503114	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
L503113	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
L503112	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	I see. Then what brought you up here?
L503111	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
L503110	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
L503109	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
L503108	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	You knew these people?
L503107	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	No, nothing.
L503106	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
L503105	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yes.
L503104	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	You're the one who found the bodies?
L503103	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Sure.
L503102	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
L503101	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
L503100	u2706	m176	SUPER	Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
L503099	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Medical clinic?
L503098	u2706	m176	SUPER	Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
L503097	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Is that the man who called you up here?
L503096	u2706	m176	SUPER	Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
L503095	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
L503302	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Down to the incinerator.
L503301	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	But where are you going?
L503287	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
L503286	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
L503285	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
L503284	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Where is he now? Do you know?
L503283	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
L503282	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
L503272	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
L503271	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. But late.
L503270	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Well? Supper at my place?
L503269	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	No. I don't think so.
L503268	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Anything wrong?
L503267	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
L503266	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
L503265	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
L503239	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	No. Dotty's the last.
L503238	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
L503237	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Another kiss?
L503236	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Uh, OK. Sure.
L503235	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Kiss, kiss?
L503234	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Do I get a kiss?
L503233	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
L503232	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
L503181	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
L503180	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
L503315	u2701	m176	JANINE	I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
L503314	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
L503310	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
L503309	u2701	m176	JANINE	Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
L503308	u2707	m176	TUDOR	You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
L503307	u2701	m176	JANINE	Nick, you're so strange...
L503306	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
L503152	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
L503151	u2701	m176	JANINE	You say something?
L503089	u2707	m176	TUDOR	I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
L503088	u2701	m176	JANINE	I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
L503087	u2707	m176	TUDOR	What do you want to call me at the office for?
L503086	u2701	m176	JANINE	Can I call you at the office?
L503333	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
L503332	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
L503331	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	Yes? Who is there?
L503300	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
L503299	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	We live in 703.
L503298	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
L503296	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
L503295	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
L503293	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
L503292	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	What happened?
L503207	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
L503206	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
L503205	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Gonna cut me open?
L503204	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
L503202	u2703	m176	PARKINS	That's the one.
L503201	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
L503200	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
L503199	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
L503198	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Didn't seem worried about them.
L503197	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
L503196	u2703	m176	PARKINS	She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
L503195	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
L503194	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Good shape for an old man, eh?
L503193	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Just breathe normally.
L503192	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Want me to breathe deeply?
L503264	u2704	m176	ROLLO	OK, Rog. See you at ten.
L503263	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
L503262	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
L503261	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yeah? What do I do then?
L503260	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
L503259	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
L503258	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
L503257	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
L503256	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Huh?
L503255	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	He didn't make it.
L503252	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Lemme clarify for you.
L503251	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I don't get it.
L503250	u2704	m176	ROLLO	It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
L503249	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK, I bite. What does it look like?
L503248	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
L503247	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	No? How come?
L503246	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
L503244	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
L503243	u2704	m176	ROLLO	It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
L503242	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yes?
L503241	u2704	m176	ROLLO	That you, Rog?
L503240	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yes?
L503150	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. I'll think about it.
L503149	u2704	m176	ROLLO	But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
L503145	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
L503144	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Who was she?
L503143	u2704	m176	ROLLO	It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
L503142	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
L503141	u2704	m176	ROLLO	You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
L503140	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
L503139	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
L503133	u2704	m176	ROLLO	You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
L503132	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I don't get it.
L503131	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
L503130	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	It's crazy.
L503129	u2704	m176	ROLLO	You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
L503128	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
L503127	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Did I say anything?
L503126	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
L503123	u2704	m176	ROLLO	That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
L503122	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
L503121	u2704	m176	ROLLO	So who changes?
L503120	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Well, at least you still talk the same.
L503119	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
L503118	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
L503117	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
L507931	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
L507930	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
L507929	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I am telling the truth.
L507928	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
L507927	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
L507926	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
L507919	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Who?
L507918	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
L507917	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	"And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the ""man"" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?"
L507916	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Of course.
L507915	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
L507914	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
L507913	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
L507912	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
L507911	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
L507780	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Good-bye.
L507779	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'm glad we talked.
L507778	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
L507777	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Okay -- for you.
L507776	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
L507775	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
L507774	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
L507773	u2768	m181	ELAINE	We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
L507772	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
L507771	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
L507770	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
L507769	u2768	m181	ELAINE	My God, are you alright, Simone?
L507768	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I'm not --  He's not.
L507767	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
L507766	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
L507765	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
L507764	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
L507763	u2768	m181	ELAINE	No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
L507762	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
L507974	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No... it's life.
L507973	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
L507969	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
L507968	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"I was thinking -- what about you and... ""Simone"" moving back in with me and Lainey?"
L507967	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
L507966	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
L507965	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
L507964	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
L507907	u2768	m181	ELAINE	How can you bring that up at a time like this?
L507906	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
L507879	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
L507878	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
L507877	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
L507876	u2768	m181	ELAINE	How much wine have you had?
L507875	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
L507874	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
L507873	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
L507872	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
L507871	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
L507870	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You?
L507869	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not if I don't let her.
L507868	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
L507867	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
L507866	u2768	m181	ELAINE	But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
L507865	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
L507864	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
L507863	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
L507862	u2768	m181	ELAINE	That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
L507861	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
L507860	u2768	m181	ELAINE	This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
L507859	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I want you back too, Viktor.
L507858	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
L507857	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
L507856	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
L507855	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I just read somewhere --
L507854	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Impossible.
L507853	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
L507852	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not quite.
L507851	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Is Simone back to earth yet?
L507850	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
L507849	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	About now.  Would you like a drink?
L507848	u2768	m181	ELAINE	When is she coming over?
L507847	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	As a matter-of-fact I am.
L507846	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
L507845	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, it's Wednesday.
L507729	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I can imagine.
L507728	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
L507727	u2768	m181	ELAINE	... Simone.
L507726	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
L507725	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	My two favorite girls.
L507660	u2768	m181	ELAINE	It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
L507659	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Excuse me?  Start?
L507658	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
L507657	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I do?
L507656	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
L507655	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Do what?
L507654	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
L507653	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.
L507652	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
L507651	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
L507650	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
L507649	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.
L507648	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
L507603	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
L507602	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
L507601	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
L507600	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Really?
L507599	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She said you were very beautiful.
L507598	u2768	m181	ELAINE	She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
L507592	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
L507591	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
L507590	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
L507589	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You're so good to protect her like this.
L507588	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She doesn't want pity.
L507587	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, you should have said something.
L507586	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
L507580	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
L507579	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I can explain.
L507578	u2768	m181	ELAINE	So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
L507573	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of ""Good For Nothing"".  It's not a good time."
L507572	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
L507561	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
L507560	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- You can't go in there!
L507502	u2768	m181	ELAINE	That's true.
L507501	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Everyone you know is lying.
L507500	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
L507499	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Soon.  Soon.
L507498	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
L507497	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
L507496	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
L507495	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You really think so?
L507494	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
L507493	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Better late than never.
L507492	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
L507486	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
L507485	u2768	m181	ELAINE	That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
L507484	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
L507479	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
L507478	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
L507380	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
L507379	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Simone does not control my destiny.
L507378	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
L507377	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
L507376	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
L507375	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'll walk you out.
L507374	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
L507373	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
L507372	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
L507371	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, shoot it on the last day.
L507370	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Even the fall from the plane.
L507369	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Even the fall from the plane?
L507368	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No need.  She does all her own stunts.
L507367	u2768	m181	ELAINE	There isn't one.
L507366	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What about it?
L507365	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"Well, we have to do something about this -- ""stuntwoman""."
L507364	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
L507363	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
L507362	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll send you her resume.
L507361	u2768	m181	ELAINE	She was in the theater?  When? Where?
L507360	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She'll do her own.  Theater training.
L507359	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Hair and make-up?
L507358	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She'll drive herself.
L507357	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
L507356	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	If it's on the page...
L507355	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
L507354	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... ""instrument""."
L507353	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
L507352	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Forever.
L507351	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"Viktor, we simply have to talk about ""Eternity..."""
L507348	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why not?
L507347	u2768	m181	ELAINE	No problem.  Do you want to come in?
L507346	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
L507218	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
L507217	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, it's my studio.
L507216	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Out of the question.  A circus like that?
L507215	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
L507214	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
L507213	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Why not?
L507212	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't know if that's going to happen.
L507211	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I can't wait to meet her.
L507210	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Almost right.
L507209	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  ""Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel""."
L507208	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
L507207	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
L507205	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
L507204	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Why isn't she with you?
L507203	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good to see you too, Elaine.
L507202	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Where is she?
L507085	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
L507084	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
L507083	u2768	m181	ELAINE	They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
L507082	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
L507081	u2768	m181	ELAINE	The picture's dead.
L507080	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
L507079	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
L507077	u2768	m181	ELAINE	How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
L507076	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You're not renewing my contract.
L507075	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
L507074	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Spare me.
L507073	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
L507072	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
L507071	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- It's called a projector.
L507070	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
L507069	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
L507068	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
L507067	u2768	m181	ELAINE	It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
L507066	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Please.
L507065	u2768	m181	ELAINE	The public decides who's on that list.
L507064	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
L507063	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- What's wrong with that?
L507062	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
L507061	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
L507060	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
L507059	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
L507058	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
L507057	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
L507056	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
L507055	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Difficult.  I'm difficult.
L507054	u2768	m181	ELAINE	God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
L507053	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Excuse us.
L507052	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
L507049	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
L507048	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
L507761	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
L507760	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Where are you?
L507759	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
L507758	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
L507757	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Hello, is this Elaine?
L507756	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Hello?
L507951	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
L507950	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
L507949	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
L507948	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, I --
L507947	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
L507946	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
L507945	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Of course.  What are you suggesting?
L507944	u2775	m181	LAINEY	So you did meet her?
L507943	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
L507942	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Because obviously she existed, right?
L507941	u2768	m181	ELAINE	God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
L507940	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Just a minute.
L507939	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
L507731	u2775	m181	LAINEY	It was a great show, Dad...
L507730	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Thank Simone for the tickets.
L507662	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
L507661	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Mom, do you miss Dad?
L507737	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I have to talk to her.
L507736	u2774	m181	KENT	Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
L507735	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
L507734	u2774	m181	KENT	Why?
L507733	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
L507097	u2768	m181	ELAINE	He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
L507096	u2774	m181	KENT	You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
L507477	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Please put your clothes on
L507476	u2769	m181	FAITH	Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here.
L507475	u2769	m181	FAITH	Is that a problem?
L507474	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You're with me to be close to her?
L507473	u2769	m181	FAITH	Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
L507472	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Simone?
L507471	u2769	m181	FAITH	Yes, call me Simone.
L507470	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What I do to Simone?
L507469	u2769	m181	FAITH	Do what you do to Simone.
L507468	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What?... What did you say?
L507465	u2769	m181	FAITH	I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
L507464	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
L507463	u2769	m181	FAITH	... so much like her?
L507462	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You look so, so...
L507461	u2769	m181	FAITH	Of course.
L507460	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
L507459	u2769	m181	FAITH	No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
L507458	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
L507980	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	And what may I ask brought this on?
L507979	u2782	m181	SIMONE	That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
L507978	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
L507977	u2782	m181	SIMONE	With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
L507976	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
L507975	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	"-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... ""why?"""
L507642	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
L507641	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
L507640	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
L507639	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	How about the nudity?
L507638	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Sure.  Where would you like to start?
L507637	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
L507636	u2782	m181	SIMONE	No, I'm okay.
L507627	u2782	m181	SIMONE	"That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, ""Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."""
L507626	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Who are you really?
L507625	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
L507624	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
L507623	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	You don't secretly want the attention?
L507622	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
L507621	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
L507620	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
L507619	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
L507530	u2771	m181	HAL	Simone!
L507529	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
L507527	u2771	m181	HAL	I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
L507526	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I know what you mean.
L507525	u2771	m181	HAL	You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
L507520	u2771	m181	HAL	Somebody said she was here.
L507519	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
L507518	u2771	m181	HAL	Is she here?
L507429	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
L507428	u2771	m181	HAL	How did the wall get there?
L507427	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
L507426	u2771	m181	HAL	-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
L507425	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	There's... a wall between you --
L507424	u2771	m181	HAL	Why not?
L507423	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You can't.
L507422	u2771	m181	HAL	But she's right there!  I must feel her!
L507421	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Absolutely not!
L507420	u2771	m181	HAL	Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
L507419	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hal, what are you doing?
L507388	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
L507387	u2771	m181	HAL	For her?
L507386	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Body double.
L507385	u2771	m181	HAL	How will you do our love scenes?
L507303	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for ""Eternity Forever""?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it."
L507302	u2771	m181	HAL	It was more in passing.
L507301	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
L507299	u2771	m181	HAL	I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
L507298	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Really?  She didn't mention it.
L507297	u2771	m181	HAL	Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
L507296	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Clyde.
L507295	u2771	m181	HAL	"And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read ""Eternity Forever"" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive."
L507294	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You never were together, Hal.
L507293	u2771	m181	HAL	The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
L507292	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hello, Hal.
L507291	u2771	m181	HAL	Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
L507047	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
L507046	u2771	m181	HAL	Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
L507135	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm already dead.
L507134	u2772	m181	HANK	I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
L507133	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
L507132	u2772	m181	HANK	I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
L507131	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You saw that?
L507130	u2772	m181	HANK	Straw God changed my life.
L507129	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You do?
L507128	u2772	m181	HANK	An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
L507127	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What's that?
L507126	u2772	m181	HANK	That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
L507125	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't know anything about computers.
L507124	u2772	m181	HANK	It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
L507123	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
L507122	u2772	m181	HANK	You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
L507121	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
L507120	u2772	m181	HANK	-- Flesh is weak.
L507119	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I need flesh and --
L507118	u2772	m181	HANK	"-- We call them ""vactors""."
L507117	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
L507116	u2772	m181	HANK	Not like this --
L507115	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I've seen them all before.
L507114	u2772	m181	HANK	You have to see her.
L507113	u2772	m181	HANK	Don't be.  It was worth it.
L507112	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm sorry.
L507111	u2772	m181	HANK	Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
L507110	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good for you, Hank.
L507109	u2772	m181	HANK	-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
L507108	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
L507107	u2772	m181	HANK	"It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... ""Who Needs Humans?"""
L507106	u2772	m181	HANK	I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
L507105	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I was misquoted.
L507104	u2772	m181	HANK	I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
L507103	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You want me to call Security?
L507102	u2772	m181	HANK	I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
L507101	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Please, get away from me.
L507100	u2772	m181	HANK	-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
L507515	u2773	m181	HARRY	I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
L507514	u2780	m181	PREMIERE REPORTER 2	Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
L507513	u2773	m181	HARRY	We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
L507512	u2780	m181	PREMIERE REPORTER 2	"There's a rumor that you're more than just ""good friends""?"
L507511	u2773	m181	HARRY	I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
L507510	u2780	m181	PREMIERE REPORTER 2	Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
L507972	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
L507971	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Me and Simone.  What I did.
L507970	u2775	m181	LAINEY	About you and mom?
L507820	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Lainey...
L507819	u2775	m181	LAINEY	There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
L507818	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, that was me.
L507817	u2775	m181	LAINEY	The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
L507816	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
L507815	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
L507814	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
L507813	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know.  Thank her for me.
L507812	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"It's the car she drove in ""Eternity Forever""."
L507811	u2775	m181	LAINEY	It's fantastic -- it's too much.
L507810	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
L507789	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She did... didn't she?
L507788	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Why didn't she thank you?
L507754	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I love you too, daddy.
L507753	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I love you, Lainey.
L507751	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
L507750	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
L507749	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
L507748	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
L507747	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
L507746	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
L507745	u2775	m181	LAINEY	She thinks you're with Simone.
L507744	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Really?  Too bad.
L507743	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
L507742	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I noticed.
L507741	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You know me -- married to my work.
L507740	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I do okay.  How about you?
L507739	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
L507490	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Night, Lainey.
L507489	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Good-night, Daddy.
L507488	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Precisely.
L507487	u2775	m181	LAINEY	So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
L507482	u2775	m181	LAINEY	No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
L507481	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
L507480	u2775	m181	LAINEY	One thing bothered me.
L507345	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
L507344	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
L507343	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- I know, I don't know anything.
L507342	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	If anyone asks about Simone --
L507341	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Okay, Dad.
L507327	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
L507326	u2775	m181	LAINEY	You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
L507325	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
L507324	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I read.
L507323	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	How?
L507322	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I do.
L507321	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
L507320	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
L507319	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
L507318	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know plenty of boys.
L507317	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
L507316	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Why?
L507315	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Can't you stop that?
L507185	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
L507184	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
L507183	u2775	m181	LAINEY	She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
L507162	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She can't watch herself.
L507161	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Is she here tonight?
L507160	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You know, I... don't know.
L507159	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
L507158	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Me too.
L507157	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
L507156	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	There was no other way.
L507155	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
L507154	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not quite how I imagined it --
L507153	u2775	m181	LAINEY	This week anyhow.
L507152	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She still with Kent?
L507151	u2775	m181	LAINEY	"She's at the premiere of ""A Cold Day In Hell"".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions."
L507150	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Your mother couldn't make it?
L507149	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hello, Lainey.
L507148	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Hi, Dad.
L507094	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
L507093	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
L507091	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
L507090	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
L507089	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
L507088	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I'm sorry Mom canned you.
L507087	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hello, sweetheart.
L507086	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Hi, Dad.
L507957	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
L507956	u2776	m181	LAWYER	What?!
L507955	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
L507938	u2776	m181	LAWYER	An insanity defence.
L507937	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
L507936	u2776	m181	LAWYER	You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
L507935	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I could get the death penalty.
L507934	u2776	m181	LAWYER	-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
L507809	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	This should take care of Mother.
L507808	u2777	m181	MAX	Don't you?
L507807	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You love her, don't you, Max?
L507806	u2777	m181	MAX	No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
L507805	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
L507804	u2777	m181	MAX	I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
L507803	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
L507802	u2777	m181	MAX	That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
L507798	u2777	m181	MAX	She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
L507797	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She looks a lot like you.
L507796	u2777	m181	MAX	I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
L507795	u2777	m181	MAX	Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
L507794	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What now, Sayer?
L507699	u2777	m181	MAX	Er,... good.
L507698	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
L507697	u2777	m181	MAX	I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
L507696	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
L507695	u2777	m181	MAX	I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
L507694	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Abduction?
L507693	u2777	m181	MAX	I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
L507692	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm keeping it in trust.
L507691	u2777	m181	MAX	"-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have ""obtained"" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her."
L507690	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I bet you have.
L507689	u2777	m181	MAX	I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
L507688	u2777	m181	MAX	She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
L507687	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	The background is.
L507686	u2777	m181	MAX	It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
L507684	u2777	m181	MAX	I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
L507683	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't have time for this, Sayer.
L507682	u2777	m181	MAX	I know what you're up to.
L507681	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's a yacht.
L507680	u2777	m181	MAX	Nice boat, Taransky.
L507338	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
L507337	u2777	m181	MAX	Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
L507336	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
L507335	u2777	m181	MAX	The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
L507334	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of ""captive"" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops."
L507333	u2777	m181	MAX	She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
L507241	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
L507240	u2777	m181	MAX	So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
L507239	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	They are alive, Sayer.
L507238	u2777	m181	MAX	Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
L507237	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
L507236	u2777	m181	MAX	This is the story.
L507235	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
L507234	u2777	m181	MAX	Max Sayer -- National Echo.
L507233	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Do I know you?
L507670	u2778	m181	MILTON	Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
L507669	u2777	m181	MAX	I don't understand.
L507668	u2778	m181	MILTON	It's a hotel.
L507666	u2778	m181	MILTON	Is that why she left you?
L507665	u2777	m181	MAX	-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
L507609	u2778	m181	MILTON	We used to.
L507608	u2777	m181	MAX	-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
L507607	u2778	m181	MILTON	Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
L507606	u2777	m181	MAX	What do you want -- ?
L507605	u2778	m181	MILTON	Mr. Sayer...
L507559	u2777	m181	MAX	Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
L507558	u2778	m181	MILTON	Long live the First Amendment.
L507557	u2777	m181	MAX	Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
L507556	u2777	m181	MAX	I will when you're finished writing it.
L507555	u2778	m181	MILTON	My God, you've got one?
L507554	u2777	m181	MAX	Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
L507553	u2777	m181	MAX	Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
L507552	u2778	m181	MILTON	Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
L507551	u2777	m181	MAX	Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
L507550	u2778	m181	MILTON	Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
L507549	u2777	m181	MAX	24-hour tail on Taransky?
L507548	u2778	m181	MILTON	We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
L507313	u2777	m181	MAX	Yes, very.
L507312	u2778	m181	MILTON	Dark?
L507311	u2777	m181	MAX	Whatever it is, it's dark.
L507310	u2778	m181	MILTON	Why?
L507309	u2777	m181	MAX	Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
L507308	u2778	m181	MILTON	Maybe he's talking to himself.
L507307	u2777	m181	MAX	Is it a jamming device?
L507837	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
L507836	u2779	m181	NICOLA	You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
L507835	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
L507834	u2779	m181	NICOLA	But that's Simone's part.
L507833	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You could play the lead.
L507832	u2779	m181	NICOLA	Thank you.
L507831	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
L507829	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes, I'd like that.
L507828	u2779	m181	NICOLA	Would you like me to read?
L507827	u2779	m181	NICOLA	After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
L507826	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.  It's not important.
L507825	u2779	m181	NICOLA	"I never apologized properly for what happened on ""Sunrise""."
L507824	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes.
L507823	u2779	m181	NICOLA	A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
L507030	u2779	m181	NICOLA	"It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing ""creative differences""."
L507029	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
L507028	u2779	m181	NICOLA	I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
L507027	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
L507023	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Taller?  What?
L507022	u2779	m181	NICOLA	Taller, Viktor.
L507021	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
L507020	u2779	m181	NICOLA	It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
L507019	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
L507018	u2779	m181	NICOLA	You're in breach.
L507017	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
L507248	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
L507247	u2781	m181	SECURITY GUARD	What if it catches on fire?
L507246	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
L507245	u2781	m181	SECURITY GUARD	Is Miss Simone coming today?
L507244	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good.
L507243	u2781	m181	SECURITY GUARD	No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
L507434	u2782	m181	SIMONE	-- What you don't understand --
L507433	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Let's take it down a notch.
L507390	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
L507389	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Simone, are you there?
L507284	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
L507283	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
L507282	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
L507269	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
L507268	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Hi.
L507442	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
L507441	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
L507281	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I was hoping you'd say that.
L507280	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	"Not, ""Eternity Forever""?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part."
L507279	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
L507278	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
L507277	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You know what I'm talking about.
L507276	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	The only real truth is in the work.
L507275	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
L507274	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
L507273	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
L507272	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
L507271	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
L507270	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You did create me.
L507264	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes.  Yes, it is.
L507263	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
L507261	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
L507260	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
L507259	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I am the death of real.
L507258	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
L507257	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Maybe he can.
L507255	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
L507254	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You mean they buy it?
L507253	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	... digitized.
L507252	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	A star is...
L507251	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
L507250	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good morning, Simone.
L511066	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	"...Chicken blood? Who said it was... ""chicken blood""?"
L511065	u2800	m183	MAC	Chicken blood on the crops.
L511064	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
L511063	u2800	m183	MAC	Superstition.
L511062	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
L511060	u2800	m183	MAC	Let's say today, we make it your business.
L511059	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	'Course, it's none of my business.
L511058	u2800	m183	MAC	What are you talking about?
L511057	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Maybe you don't want to remember.
L511055	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
L511054	u2800	m183	MAC	Meaning?
L511053	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
L510653	u2800	m183	MAC	How'd he know I'd come?
L510652	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
L510908	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
L510907	u2799	m183	KEITH	Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
L510905	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
L510904	u2799	m183	KEITH	Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
L510890	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
L510889	u2799	m183	KEITH	Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
L510888	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	You were a beat and a quarter behind.
L510887	u2799	m183	KEITH	See?
L510886	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Nope.
L510885	u2799	m183	KEITH	"Yo. ""Billy Bob"". Was I two beats behind, or what?"

L510846	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Could take a little while, though.
L510845	u2799	m183	KEITH	Alright!
L510844	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
L510658	u2792	m183	BILLY BOB	You're standing in horseshit.
L510657	u2799	m183	KEITH	Oh yeah? Why's that?

L510944	u2803	m183	SUZIE	The band.
L510943	u2793	m183	CANDY	No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
L510942	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
L510941	u2793	m183	CANDY	You have a strong unfufilled desire.

L511007	u2794	m183	CARL	You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
L511006	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Carl, what are you doing?
L510999	u2794	m183	CARL	"Suzie, face it. The only ""axe"" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you."
L510998	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Come on --
L510995	u2794	m183	CARL	Not someone -- Mac.
L510994	u2803	m183	SUZIE	You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
L510993	u2794	m183	CARL	I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
L510992	u2803	m183	SUZIE	No shit.
L510991	u2794	m183	CARL	There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
L510989	u2794	m183	CARL	Sorry.
L510988	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Dammit, Carl!!!!
L510973	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
L510972	u2794	m183	CARL	Hey, isn't that the preacher?
L510841	u2794	m183	CARL	I didn't do anything --
L510840	u2803	m183	SUZIE	How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
L510839	u2794	m183	CARL	Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
L510838	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Looks like the alternator.
L510984	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
L510983	u2795	m183	GENE	You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
L510980	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Bus broke down.
L510979	u2795	m183	GENE	Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
L510971	u2795	m183	GENE	Book of Jeremiah.
L510970	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Sounds familiar.
L510969	u2795	m183	GENE	"Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. ""You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."""
L510968	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
L510967	u2795	m183	GENE	Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
L510966	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Gene.

L510598	u2799	m183	KEITH	Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
L510597	u2796	m183	IAN	Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
L510596	u2799	m183	KEITH	Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
L510595	u2796	m183	IAN	"All right. ""Fratricide"". Minor technical detail."
L510594	u2799	m183	KEITH	That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
L510593	u2796	m183	IAN	Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
L510592	u2799	m183	KEITH	"Wait a second. Did you say ""patricide?"""
L510589	u2796	m183	IAN	Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.

L510949	u2802	m183	ROD	It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
L510948	u2796	m183	IAN	So... what does it do?
L510939	u2802	m183	ROD	Manure... is life.
L510938	u2796	m183	IAN	Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
L510937	u2802	m183	ROD	Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
L510936	u2796	m183	IAN	Are you crazy?
L510934	u2796	m183	IAN	Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
L510933	u2802	m183	ROD	The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.

L511178	u2800	m183	MAC	I --
L511177	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
L511176	u2800	m183	MAC	Amends...?
L511175	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	It's time to make amends.
L511100	u2800	m183	MAC	Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
L511099	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	-- It's not me!
L511098	u2800	m183	MAC	"Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? ""Crazy Old Macdonald!"" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!"
L511079	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
L511078	u2800	m183	MAC	People say he was a murderer.
L511077	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Sure. What do you want to know.
L511076	u2800	m183	MAC	"That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little ""talk"" about grandaddy Jethro."
L511075	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
L510830	u2800	m183	MAC	I don't think so.
L510829	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	You'll be back.
L510783	u2800	m183	MAC	Blood?
L510782	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
L510781	u2800	m183	MAC	"She was talking about... a ""harvest of blood""..."
L510780	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
L510779	u2800	m183	MAC	Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
L510778	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
L510774	u2800	m183	MAC	I'll be fine here.
L510773	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
L510772	u2800	m183	MAC	This is his room... isn't it?
L510771	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
L510685	u2800	m183	MAC	Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
L510684	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Pardon?
L510683	u2800	m183	MAC	"How... was she ""called?"""
L510682	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
L510681	u2800	m183	MAC	I'll be gone again tomorrow.
L510680	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
L510679	u2800	m183	MAC	I came back for the funeral. That's all.
L510675	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
L510674	u2800	m183	MAC	Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
L510673	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
L510672	u2800	m183	MAC	I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
L510671	u2800	m183	MAC	You know who I am. You invited me.
L510670	u2797	m183	JEREMIAH	Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
L510669	u2800	m183	MAC	What are you going to do? Shoot me?
L510519	u2798	m183	KAREN	Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
L510518	u2801	m183	RAY	Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
L510517	u2801	m183	RAY	Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
L510516	u2798	m183	KAREN	What's wrong?
L510515	u2801	m183	RAY	Ow!
L510513	u2798	m183	KAREN	-- By way of my breasts?
L510512	u2801	m183	RAY	Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
L510511	u2798	m183	KAREN	Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
L510507	u2801	m183	RAY	You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
L510506	u2798	m183	KAREN	I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
L510505	u2801	m183	RAY	Never heard of it.
L510504	u2798	m183	KAREN	Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
L510503	u2801	m183	RAY	"I'm admiring your costume. What ""movie"" are you going as again?"
L510502	u2798	m183	KAREN	-- And keep your eyes on the road.
L510501	u2798	m183	KAREN	Not while you're driving.
L510500	u2801	m183	RAY	Throw me one.
L510883	u2803	m183	SUZIE	He's right. You were behind.
L510882	u2799	m183	KEITH	What the fuck you talking about, man?

L510811	u2803	m183	SUZIE	You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
L510810	u2799	m183	KEITH	He started it.
L510809	u2803	m183	SUZIE	It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
L510647	u2799	m183	KEITH	"Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: ""Bobby- Joe"" --"
L510646	u2803	m183	SUZIE	You got something against farm people, Keith?
L510645	u2799	m183	KEITH	Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
L510632	u2799	m183	KEITH	"Who you callin' ""boy?"""
L510631	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Down boy.
L510630	u2799	m183	KEITH	Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
L510629	u2803	m183	SUZIE	You know what they say about men who need big guns...
L510608	u2799	m183	KEITH	Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
L510607	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
L510557	u2803	m183	SUZIE	The audience!
L510556	u2799	m183	KEITH	Who? Us?!
L510555	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
L510881	u2802	m183	ROD	Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
L510880	u2799	m183	KEITH	You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
L510606	u2799	m183	KEITH	Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
L510605	u2802	m183	ROD	Bzzzzzzzzzt!

L510603	u2802	m183	ROD	Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!

L510912	u2800	m183	MAC	Is that right?
L510911	u2799	m183	KEITH	Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
L510910	u2800	m183	MAC	How does it feel, Keith?
L510893	u2799	m183	KEITH	Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
L510892	u2800	m183	MAC	You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
L510843	u2800	m183	MAC	Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
L510842	u2799	m183	KEITH	Yeah. That's just the problem.
L510628	u2799	m183	KEITH	"Yeah. That sounds good. ""Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig""."
L510627	u2800	m183	MAC	Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
L510575	u2800	m183	MAC	Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
L510574	u2799	m183	KEITH	Yes!
L510573	u2800	m183	MAC	Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.

L511142	u2803	m183	SUZIE	It's you. You and your father.
L511141	u2800	m183	MAC	Suzie... No.
L511140	u2800	m183	MAC	I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
L511139	u2803	m183	SUZIE	You're... limping.
L511138	u2800	m183	MAC	"-- You're not making sense!! What ""Scarecrow""?"
L511137	u2803	m183	SUZIE	HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
L511136	u2800	m183	MAC	What are --
L511135	u2803	m183	SUZIE	I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
L511134	u2800	m183	MAC	Wait a minute --
L511133	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
L511132	u2800	m183	MAC	Suzie --
L510897	u2803	m183	SUZIE	You never had trouble communicating before.
L510896	u2800	m183	MAC	You wouldn't understand.
L510823	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Mmmm -- so can I...
L510822	u2800	m183	MAC	Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
L510821	u2803	m183	SUZIE	I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
L510820	u2800	m183	MAC	Look. You want to talk about this?
L510819	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Getting ready.
L510818	u2800	m183	MAC	Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
L510817	u2803	m183	SUZIE	How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
L510816	u2800	m183	MAC	I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
L510815	u2803	m183	SUZIE	We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
L510801	u2800	m183	MAC	I said that's enough!
L510800	u2803	m183	SUZIE	"Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... ""Jethro."""
L510799	u2803	m183	SUZIE	I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
L510798	u2800	m183	MAC	Let it go.
L510797	u2803	m183	SUZIE	I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
L510794	u2800	m183	MAC	When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
L510793	u2803	m183	SUZIE	So?
L510792	u2800	m183	MAC	This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
L510791	u2803	m183	SUZIE	What's wrong?
L510724	u2800	m183	MAC	Nah. Just you.
L510723	u2803	m183	SUZIE	What about Jeremiah?
L510620	u2800	m183	MAC	Still trying to figure it out myself.
L510619	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Then why go back now?
L510618	u2800	m183	MAC	Name something.
L510617	u2803	m183	SUZIE	About what?
L510616	u2800	m183	MAC	My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
L510614	u2800	m183	MAC	Nothing to tell.
L510613	u2803	m183	SUZIE	You never told us you grew up on a farm.
L510571	u2800	m183	MAC	-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
L510570	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Yeah?
L510569	u2800	m183	MAC	"Time for a little... ""feedback"" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --"
L511107	u2803	m183	SUZIE	What'll we do?
L511106	u2802	m183	ROD	It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
L511049	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Why bother?
L511048	u2802	m183	ROD	Someone better tell Mac.
L511044	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
L511043	u2802	m183	ROD	CARL??? Carl did this?!!
L511042	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Carl.
L511027	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
L511026	u2802	m183	ROD	Where's Mac?
L511019	u2802	m183	ROD	Us? We been... moonlighting.
L511018	u2803	m183	SUZIE	-- Where have you two been?
L510879	u2802	m183	ROD	Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
L510878	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Second verse!
L510877	u2802	m183	ROD	It's coming right up. After the third verse.
L510876	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Like your guitar break.
L510875	u2802	m183	ROD	Like what?
L510874	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
L510856	u2803	m183	SUZIE	What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
L510855	u2802	m183	ROD	She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
L510727	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Spider.
L510726	u2802	m183	ROD	What is it?!!
L510577	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
L510576	u2802	m183	ROD	Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
L510563	u2802	m183	ROD	I was getting 'warmed' up.
L510562	u2803	m183	SUZIE	Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
L513715	u2808	m184	JACK	I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
L513714	u2804	m184	BILL	And that makes you look like a squid?
L513713	u2808	m184	JACK	Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
L513712	u2804	m184	BILL	What?
L513707	u2804	m184	BILL	Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
L513706	u2808	m184	JACK	That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
L513705	u2804	m184	BILL	Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
L513704	u2808	m184	JACK	How are you going to find him?
L513702	u2808	m184	JACK	Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
L513701	u2804	m184	BILL	Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
L513700	u2808	m184	JACK	Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
L513699	u2804	m184	BILL	'Mornin', Jack.
L513698	u2808	m184	JACK	Bill, we need to talk!
L513697	u2804	m184	BILL	Shit.
L513599	u2804	m184	BILL	You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
L513598	u2808	m184	JACK	Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
L513597	u2808	m184	JACK	Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
L514039	u2812	m184	STARLA	And this is mine.
L514038	u2804	m184	BILL	It's my nature.
L514037	u2812	m184	STARLA	You took Bill.
L514036	u2804	m184	BILL	Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
L514035	u2812	m184	STARLA	Okay.
L514034	u2804	m184	BILL	We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
L514033	u2812	m184	STARLA	Aspirin.
L514032	u2804	m184	BILL	I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
L514028	u2804	m184	BILL	Yeah. Good.
L514027	u2812	m184	STARLA	We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
L513987	u2804	m184	BILL	No, Starla! No!
L513986	u2812	m184	STARLA	He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
L513985	u2804	m184	BILL	What?
L513984	u2812	m184	STARLA	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
L513983	u2804	m184	BILL	What are you doing?!
L513963	u2804	m184	BILL	Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
L513962	u2812	m184	STARLA	After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
L513959	u2804	m184	BILL	I'm sorry.
L513958	u2812	m184	STARLA	That wasn't a good night, no.
L513957	u2804	m184	BILL	When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
L513956	u2812	m184	STARLA	My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
L513955	u2804	m184	BILL	Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
L513954	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
L513953	u2812	m184	STARLA	I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
L513952	u2804	m184	BILL	Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
L513843	u2812	m184	STARLA	Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
L513842	u2804	m184	BILL	No reception out here.
L513756	u2812	m184	STARLA	It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
L513755	u2804	m184	BILL	Starla, it ain't --
L513754	u2812	m184	STARLA	Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
L513753	u2812	m184	STARLA	He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
L513752	u2804	m184	BILL	He tried to kill you, Starla.
L513751	u2812	m184	STARLA	Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
L513750	u2804	m184	BILL	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
L513749	u2812	m184	STARLA	Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
L513693	u2804	m184	BILL	New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
L513692	u2812	m184	STARLA	How about Brenda?
L513666	u2804	m184	BILL	She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
L513665	u2812	m184	STARLA	No. What??
L513664	u2804	m184	BILL	Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
L513637	u2804	m184	BILL	Hey, Grant.
L513636	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, where'd you go?
L513633	u2812	m184	STARLA	I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
L513632	u2804	m184	BILL	Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
L513631	u2812	m184	STARLA	Oh, yeah?
L513630	u2804	m184	BILL	There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
L513629	u2804	m184	BILL	Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
L513628	u2812	m184	STARLA	I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
L513627	u2804	m184	BILL	Pretty, ain't they?
L513626	u2812	m184	STARLA	Just checking out the lights.
L513625	u2804	m184	BILL	What you up to?
L513624	u2804	m184	BILL	Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
L513623	u2812	m184	STARLA	Whatcha' doin'?
L513622	u2804	m184	BILL	Sorry.
L513621	u2812	m184	STARLA	That's not funny.
L513620	u2804	m184	BILL	Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
L513980	u2804	m184	BILL	Just block the doors, any way you can.
L513979	u2813	m184	TREVOR	What the hell are we going to do?!
L513972	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby!
L513971	u2813	m184	TREVOR	When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
L513937	u2804	m184	BILL	A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
L513936	u2813	m184	TREVOR	He's a fucking Martian?!
L513898	u2813	m184	TREVOR	We're coming your way, man!
L513897	u2804	m184	BILL	Where are you?!
L513741	u2813	m184	TREVOR	I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
L513740	u2804	m184	BILL	And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
L513733	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
L513732	u2804	m184	BILL	He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
L513593	u2804	m184	BILL	That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
L513592	u2813	m184	TREVOR	What's she see in that douchebag?
L513805	u2814	m184	WALLY	What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
L513804	u2804	m184	BILL	I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
L513739	u2804	m184	BILL	Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
L513738	u2814	m184	WALLY	Looks like a chipmunk.
L513722	u2814	m184	WALLY	What do you see? I see a butterfly.
L513721	u2804	m184	BILL	Rorschach.
L513668	u2804	m184	BILL	The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
L513667	u2814	m184	WALLY	Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
L513643	u2804	m184	BILL	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
L513642	u2814	m184	WALLY	What?
L513641	u2804	m184	BILL	Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
L513640	u2814	m184	WALLY	Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
L513975	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Don't worry, Chief.
L513974	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
L513973	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Hey there, Chief.
L513950	u2804	m184	BILL	Do it.
L513949	u2811	m184	SHELBY	I got to leave my post.
L513948	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
L513918	u2804	m184	BILL	We'll be there in ten minutes.
L513917	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Sorry.
L513916	u2804	m184	BILL	I can't hear when you're nodding.
L513915	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Yeah.
L513914	u2804	m184	BILL	Are you nodding?
L513913	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
L513912	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
L513911	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby --
L513910	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
L513909	u2804	m184	BILL	Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
L513908	u2811	m184	SHELBY	You dig that rat out of the hole?
L513656	u2807	m184	GRANT	Brought you munchies.
L513655	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
L513615	u2807	m184	GRANT	Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
L513614	u2805	m184	BRENDA	What?
L513613	u2807	m184	GRANT	Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
L513610	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
L513609	u2807	m184	GRANT	Where's the old half--Mexican?
L513608	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Shut up.
L513607	u2807	m184	GRANT	You're lookin' awful pretty.
L513527	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
L513526	u2807	m184	GRANT	Already ain't. Married a gal named --
L513525	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
L513524	u2807	m184	GRANT	Who's the lucky fella?
L513523	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Hell, I was game!
L513522	u2807	m184	GRANT	Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
L513521	u2805	m184	BRENDA	My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
L513519	u2807	m184	GRANT	Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
L513518	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Megan Halesy' little sister.
L513567	u2807	m184	GRANT	Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
L513566	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	All the rib eyes?
L513565	u2807	m184	GRANT	Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
L513563	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	How many you need?
L513562	u2807	m184	GRANT	Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
L513561	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	What can I do you for?
L513560	u2807	m184	GRANT	Sure thing, killer.
L513559	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
L513558	u2807	m184	GRANT	Meat.
L513678	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, you're sick!
L513677	u2807	m184	GRANT	I loved you. I loved --
L513676	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, no!
L513675	u2807	m184	GRANT	Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
L513654	u2807	m184	GRANT	No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
L513653	u2812	m184	STARLA	I'll get if for you.
L513651	u2807	m184	GRANT	Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
L513650	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
L513591	u2812	m184	STARLA	It's just one of my students, Grant.
L513590	u2807	m184	GRANT	Who's that?
L513589	u2807	m184	GRANT	You're pretty.
L513588	u2812	m184	STARLA	What are you doing?
L513577	u2807	m184	GRANT	I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
L513576	u2812	m184	STARLA	Okay.
L513575	u2807	m184	GRANT	You're my princess, aren't you?
L513574	u2812	m184	STARLA	My present?
L513573	u2807	m184	GRANT	Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
L513571	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
L513570	u2807	m184	GRANT	Welcome home.
L513547	u2807	m184	GRANT	Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
L513546	u2812	m184	STARLA	I never danced in a towel before.
L513514	u2807	m184	GRANT	Out.
L513513	u2812	m184	STARLA	That's not true -- Where are you--?
L513512	u2807	m184	GRANT	I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
L513511	u2812	m184	STARLA	Where are you going?
L513509	u2812	m184	STARLA	That's disrespectful.
L513508	u2807	m184	GRANT	Flip.
L513506	u2807	m184	GRANT	Sure you do.
L513505	u2812	m184	STARLA	I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
L513504	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
L513500	u2807	m184	GRANT	Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
L513499	u2812	m184	STARLA	It's just a work thing.
L513498	u2807	m184	GRANT	Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
L513497	u2812	m184	STARLA	He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
L513945	u2812	m184	STARLA	An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
L513944	u2809	m184	KYLIE	When one sees you they all see you.
L513943	u2812	m184	STARLA	And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
L513942	u2809	m184	KYLIE	He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
L513941	u2812	m184	STARLA	Through a wound on his stomach?
L513940	u2809	m184	KYLIE	Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
L513935	u2812	m184	STARLA	What other stuff?
L513934	u2809	m184	KYLIE	But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
L513858	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Margaret.
L513857	u2810	m184	MARGARET	Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
L513839	u2813	m184	TREVOR	'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
L513838	u2810	m184	MARGARET	Praise Jesus.
L513787	u2810	m184	MARGARET	We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
L513786	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Where'd he go?
L513728	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Hey, look!
L513727	u2810	m184	MARGARET	So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
L513595	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Gold--digger, huh?
L513594	u2810	m184	MARGARET	Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
L562603	u3064	m201	CANDY	The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
L562602	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Testa?
L562601	u3064	m201	CANDY	To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
L562600	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Besides that.
L562599	u3064	m201	CANDY	Um... he was older.
L562598	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Was this him?
L562506	u3065	m201	DAITZ	Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
L562505	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
L562502	u3065	m201	DAITZ	"You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was ""out to get him."" The decision was made to relieve him."
L562501	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
L562500	u3065	m201	DAITZ	...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
L562499	u3065	m201	DAITZ	Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
L562498	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No.
L562497	u3065	m201	DAITZ	"Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter ""Z,"" turned it on it's side, got ""N"" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?"
L562496	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Have you had a chance to think about --
L562262	u3077	m201	SALINAS	The diner?
L562261	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	No, sir.
L562260	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Anybody talk to the press?
L562259	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
L562258	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
L562221	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
L562220	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
L562200	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	Yeah.
L562199	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
L562198	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
L562812	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Winona.
L562811	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
L562810	u3067	m201	DYLAN	She's buried.
L562809	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You have the body?
L562808	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
L562807	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What?
L562806	u3067	m201	DYLAN	You heard?
L562805	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
L562804	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Hi there.
L562803	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
L562802	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Dylan here.
L562389	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
L562388	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
L562387	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
L562385	u3067	m201	DYLAN	And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
L562384	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The room key's in the car. On the seat.
L562382	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let's take a look.
L562381	u3067	m201	DYLAN	I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
L562380	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What does the Manager say?
L562379	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
L562378	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Hey, Sheriff.
L562377	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm on my way.
L562376	u3067	m201	DYLAN	No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
L562375	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You tell me.
L562374	u3067	m201	DYLAN	What's the bad news?
L562373	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
L562372	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
L562371	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Agent Mackelway.
L562296	u3067	m201	DYLAN	I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
L562295	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This isn't in our database?
L562294	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Who knows.
L562293	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You're thinking...?
L562292	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
L562291	u3067	m201	DYLAN	I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
L562290	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
L562289	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
L562280	u3067	m201	DYLAN	That's right, Jan.
L562279	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
L562243	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Ten miles back on the Texas side.
L562242	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
L562230	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
L562229	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
L562228	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
L562227	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You run the plates?
L562844	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
L562843	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	A grill pattern.
L562842	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
L562841	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
L562840	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm sorry. This won't take long.
L562839	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
L562313	u3077	m201	SALINAS	That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
L562312	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
L562306	u3077	m201	SALINAS	This is Agent Mackelway.
L562305	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
L562300	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
L562299	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
L562298	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
L562297	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
L562880	u3078	m201	ZERO	Not as much as you'd think.
L562879	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
L562878	u3078	m201	ZERO	It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
L562877	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
L562876	u3078	m201	ZERO	Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
L562875	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	I have 6 tons.
L562874	u3078	m201	ZERO	Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
L562873	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	There seems to be a discrepancy.
L562196	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Why me? What do you want from me!?
L562195	u3074	m201	LOW	I've been looking for you.
L562192	u3070	m201	HAROLD	What do you want from me?
L562191	u3074	m201	LOW	You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
L562190	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
L562189	u3074	m201	LOW	Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
L562186	u3074	m201	LOW	What's wrong with me?
L562185	u3070	m201	HAROLD	You're a... you're sick.
L562184	u3074	m201	LOW	Not bad, huh?
L562183	u3070	m201	HAROLD	My God.
L562181	u3074	m201	LOW	Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
L562180	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Look, mister...
L562179	u3074	m201	LOW	Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
L562178	u3070	m201	HAROLD	What are you...?
L562177	u3074	m201	LOW	You know, you ever think about other women?
L562176	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Excuse me?
L562175	u3074	m201	LOW	You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
L562174	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Look...
L562173	u3074	m201	LOW	About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
L562172	u3070	m201	HAROLD	What?
L562171	u3074	m201	LOW	Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
L562170	u3070	m201	HAROLD	I don't mean to be rude, but...
L562169	u3074	m201	LOW	Whole country or just hereabouts?
L562168	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Yeah.
L562167	u3074	m201	LOW	You must travel a lot, huh?
L562166	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
L562165	u3074	m201	LOW	Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
L562164	u3070	m201	HAROLD	You... surprised me.
L562163	u3074	m201	LOW	Hi. What's in the case?
L562162	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Jesus.
L562286	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Put a BOLO out on that.
L562285	u3071	m201	JANITA	An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
L562284	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What kind?
L562283	u3071	m201	JANITA	There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
L562282	u3071	m201	JANITA	It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
L562281	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He was sitting here?
L562278	u3071	m201	JANITA	He had an orange hat on.
L562277	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How did you know he was a construction worker?
L562276	u3071	m201	JANITA	I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
L562275	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What did he look like?
L562274	u3071	m201	JANITA	Yes.
L562273	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
L562416	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
L562415	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
L562414	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	"Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about ""Zorro Killer"" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?"
L562413	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Maybe something to do with Zorro.
L562412	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	He said it was a clue?
L562316	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
L562315	u3077	m201	SALINAS	At the field office.
L562314	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You have the photo from the diner?
L562311	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What's with the eyelids?
L562310	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
L562309	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What about his killer?
L562308	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
L562950	u3073	m201	KULOK	Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
L562949	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
L562948	u3073	m201	KULOK	Please.
L562947	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What are you doing?
L562946	u3073	m201	KULOK	Deputy Director, get out, sir.
L562596	u3073	m201	KULOK	Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
L562595	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Another what?
L562594	u3073	m201	KULOK	We have another one.
L562593	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What?
L562592	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
L562345	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Smarter than us.
L562344	u3073	m201	KULOK	Maybe cause he's smart.
L562343	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
L562304	u3073	m201	KULOK	Just an observer.
L562303	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
L562904	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
L562903	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Dick Low's a killer too.
L562902	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
L562901	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
L562900	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
L562899	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
L562898	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
L562897	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
L562896	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
L562895	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	He's got you believing in Zero now too.
L562747	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
L562746	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I understand.
L562745	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
L562744	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
L562743	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	There was talk of a file photo.
L562742	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I didn't use Low's name.
L562741	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
L562740	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was looking for a pattern.
L562739	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
L562738	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
L562737	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You didn't tell anyone where you were?
L562736	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was visiting an old college friend.
L562735	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Why did you go to Chicago?
L562625	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
L562624	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Huh?, sir.
L562623	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
L562622	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
L562621	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
L562618	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Collected shoes too?
L562617	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was ""Imelda."" Have to give him that, had a sense of humor."
L562591	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
L562590	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
L562589	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
L562588	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"You knew the arm slash was not ""Zorro."""
L562587	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
L562586	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How long ago?
L562585	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
L562584	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
L562583	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
L562582	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Was?
L562581	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
L562580	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
L562579	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	"Murman was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original ""Catch Me Before I Kill Again"" killer. Short for ""Murder Man."" It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field."
L562558	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
L562557	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm hesitant to...
L562556	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I don't believe this.
L562555	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
L562547	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
L562546	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
L562545	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
L562428	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
L562427	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
L562426	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What I do requires confidentiality.
L562425	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I'll take it into consideration.
L562424	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
L562423	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
L562422	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
L562421	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
L562410	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Go ahead.
L562409	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
L562405	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
L562404	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Do you think he singled you out?
L562403	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He got away. I had him. He got away.
L562402	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
L562401	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
L562400	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	How do you feel, Agent
L562369	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Then why do I still have a badge?
L562368	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Its called insubordination.
L562367	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
L562366	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You refused to comply with a direct order.
L562365	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
L562364	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
L562363	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
L562362	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
L562361	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
L562360	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I'll relay this to CIIAC.
L562353	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	MyDick.
L562352	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	From the grave?
L562351	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Speck. Harold Speck.
L562350	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Who?
L562349	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I think I talked to him.
L562347	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	This better be important.
L562346	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
L562945	u3074	m201	LOW	You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
L562944	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
L562943	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
L562942	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
L562941	u3074	m201	LOW	When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
L562937	u3074	m201	LOW	Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
L562936	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You are so fucked up.
L562935	u3074	m201	LOW	How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
L562934	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
L562933	u3074	m201	LOW	You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
L562932	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Don't you touch him.
L562926	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
L562925	u3074	m201	LOW	Miss me, Dave?
L562907	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm going to Amarillo.
L562906	u3073	m201	KULOK	What happened?
L562872	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
L562871	u3073	m201	KULOK	How are we going to find him?
L562870	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
L562869	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
L562868	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jaime --
L562867	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've got to take a piss.
L562866	u3073	m201	KULOK	I...
L562865	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
L562863	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"But it was your idea: ""use Zero,"" you said, use Zero to get Low."
L562862	u3073	m201	KULOK	You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
L562861	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
L562860	u3073	m201	KULOK	Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
L562859	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Low calls him Suspect Zero.
L562858	u3073	m201	KULOK	All the same killer?
L562857	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as ""burn residue."" Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection."
L562856	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's quite advanced.
L562853	u3073	m201	KULOK	What's going on?
L562852	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah, of course.
L562851	u3073	m201	KULOK	You okay?
L562850	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
L562849	u3073	m201	KULOK	Tom, you okay?
L562848	u3073	m201	KULOK	Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
L562847	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	But why this pattern?
L562832	u3073	m201	KULOK	Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
L562831	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
L562830	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
L562829	u3073	m201	KULOK	You're putting me in a difficult position.
L562828	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
L562827	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
L562826	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
L562825	u3073	m201	KULOK	I'd be real careful if I were you.
L562824	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
L562823	u3073	m201	KULOK	Koessler doesn't know any of this?
L562822	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
L562821	u3073	m201	KULOK	Does one exist?
L562820	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
L562819	u3073	m201	KULOK	And you're working with him?
L562818	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You were right. He found me.
L562817	u3073	m201	KULOK	Slow down a second, you met with Low --
L562816	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
L562815	u3073	m201	KULOK	What's going on?
L562814	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I guess I'm a little paranoid.
L562813	u3073	m201	KULOK	This feels like something out of a spy novel.
L562714	u3073	m201	KULOK	But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
L562713	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
L562712	u3073	m201	KULOK	Suspect Zero.
L562711	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Start killing people for real?
L562710	u3073	m201	KULOK	You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
L562709	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
L562696	u3073	m201	KULOK	I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
L562695	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What's up?
L562694	u3073	m201	KULOK	Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
L562693	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jaime? Where are you?
L562692	u3073	m201	KULOK	Hello?
L562657	u3073	m201	KULOK	I just need to go a little slow.
L562656	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
L562655	u3073	m201	KULOK	That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
L562654	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Not the way I can.
L562653	u3073	m201	KULOK	And nobody else can do that?
L562652	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
L562651	u3073	m201	KULOK	You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
L562650	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What's that?
L562649	u3073	m201	KULOK	Then there's the other issue.
L562648	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's true.
L562647	u3073	m201	KULOK	There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
L562646	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Oh.
L562645	u3073	m201	KULOK	No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
L562644	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
L562643	u3073	m201	KULOK	Maybe we should back off a bit.
L562642	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You did.
L562641	u3073	m201	KULOK	I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
L562640	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
L562639	u3073	m201	KULOK	Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
L562620	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
L562619	u3073	m201	KULOK	You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
L562615	u3073	m201	KULOK	Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
L562614	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
L562613	u3073	m201	KULOK	You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
L562612	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You mean --
L562611	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sue Ann Hanson.
L562610	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The tattoo?
L562609	u3073	m201	KULOK	We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
L562608	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jesus.
L562607	u3073	m201	KULOK	We did find these, however.
L562606	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
L562605	u3073	m201	KULOK	No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
L562604	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Find the feet?
L562528	u3073	m201	KULOK	Not yet. Not about this, either.
L562527	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Not about coming to see Daitz?
L562526	u3073	m201	KULOK	Just routine stuff.
L562525	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What did you tell him?
L562524	u3073	m201	KULOK	He's called a couple times.
L562523	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Does Koessler ask about me?
L562522	u3073	m201	KULOK	I've been thinking about this.
L562521	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I know.
L562520	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's a no-no.
L562519	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Intra-Agency fraternizing.
L562518	u3073	m201	KULOK	There are Agency regulations about this.
L562517	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Oh yeah, I forgot.
L562516	u3073	m201	KULOK	Because you asked him to, stupid.
L562515	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
L562514	u3073	m201	KULOK	No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
L562513	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
L562512	u3073	m201	KULOK	Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
L562511	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
L562510	u3073	m201	KULOK	Huh?
L562509	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
L562508	u3073	m201	KULOK	Don't be too harsh.
L562507	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
L562473	u3073	m201	KULOK	He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
L562472	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
L562471	u3073	m201	KULOK	I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
L562470	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
L562469	u3073	m201	KULOK	"Me too.  Make any headway with ""Zorro""?"
L562468	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
L562465	u3073	m201	KULOK	My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
L562464	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
L562463	u3073	m201	KULOK	What's this country coming to?
L562462	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He thinks he looks young.
L562461	u3073	m201	KULOK	Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
L562460	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Look at this fellow... or this one.
L562458	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sex.
L562457	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What's that?
L562456	u3073	m201	KULOK	And one other thing.
L562455	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
L562454	u3073	m201	KULOK	I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
L562453	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
L562452	u3073	m201	KULOK	You got a point there.
L562451	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
L562450	u3073	m201	KULOK	This is some serious shit.
L562449	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: ""I went live last month."""
L562448	u3073	m201	KULOK	Gone live?
L562447	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
L562446	u3073	m201	KULOK	They're all criminals?
L562445	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
L562444	u3073	m201	KULOK	You want to have dinner?
L562443	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The other reason?
L562442	u3073	m201	KULOK	That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
L562441	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying ""friends"" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, ""How to Plant Perennials."" Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how."
L562440	u3073	m201	KULOK	What about the chat rooms themselves?
L562439	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes ""ghosted,"" invisible."
L562438	u3073	m201	KULOK	Don't even go there. What's up?
L562437	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The man knew how to dress.
L562436	u3073	m201	KULOK	Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
L562418	u3073	m201	KULOK	It explains a lot.
L562417	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes I do.
L562408	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Where's my watch? It's gone.
L562407	u3073	m201	KULOK	Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
L562336	u3073	m201	KULOK	A very sexy case.
L562335	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That information's being withheld from the media.
L562334	u3073	m201	KULOK	And who kills in the manner of his victim.
L562333	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
L562332	u3073	m201	KULOK	Doesn't fit.
L562331	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
L562330	u3073	m201	KULOK	This is a sexy case.
L562329	u3073	m201	KULOK	Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
L562328	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Why did he come out here? What's going on?
L562327	u3073	m201	KULOK	Not especially.
L562326	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You work with Koessler?
L562325	u3073	m201	KULOK	Five months. I love it.
L562324	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How long have you been downtown?
L562323	u3073	m201	KULOK	I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
L562322	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The Academy, then CIIAC.
L562321	u3073	m201	KULOK	You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
L562320	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
L562319	u3073	m201	KULOK	None taken.
L562318	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
L562317	u3073	m201	KULOK	Thanks for the ride.
L562986	u3073	m201	KULOK	I'll be back.
L562985	u3074	m201	LOW	Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
L562983	u3073	m201	KULOK	Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
L562982	u3074	m201	LOW	No weapon.
L562981	u3073	m201	KULOK	Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
L562963	u3073	m201	KULOK	I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
L562962	u3074	m201	LOW	Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
L562961	u3074	m201	LOW	Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
L562960	u3073	m201	KULOK	Mack must think Zero has a police band.
L562955	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sit back.
L562954	u3074	m201	LOW	Unlock these cuffs.
L562931	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
L562930	u3073	m201	KULOK	Kulok.
L562929	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent...
L562994	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah.
L562993	u3074	m201	LOW	Was it Zero?
L562992	u3074	m201	LOW	The boy's okay. I saw him...
L562991	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah.
L562990	u3074	m201	LOW	Is he dead?
L562799	u3074	m201	LOW	Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
L562798	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You? You went by the book?
L562797	u3074	m201	LOW	This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
L562796	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Maybe you should back off.
L562795	u3074	m201	LOW	We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
L562794	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Those were just fantasies.
L562793	u3074	m201	LOW	I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
L562792	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	It was the mall.
L562791	u3074	m201	LOW	You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
L562790	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Who told you about her?
L562789	u3074	m201	LOW	If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
L562788	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I already have an employer.
L562787	u3074	m201	LOW	There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
L562786	u3074	m201	LOW	Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
L562785	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You knew it was me all along?
L562784	u3074	m201	LOW	And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
L562783	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How do you know who's real and who's not?
L562782	u3074	m201	LOW	After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
L562781	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
L562780	u3074	m201	LOW	Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
L562779	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Zero killed them all?
L562778	u3074	m201	LOW	It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
L562776	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
L562775	u3074	m201	LOW	Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
L562774	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession...
L562773	u3074	m201	LOW	You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
L562772	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I don't carry it with me.
L562771	u3074	m201	LOW	Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
L562770	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	So you went underground?
L562769	u3074	m201	LOW	Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
L562768	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Suspect Zero?
L562767	u3074	m201	LOW	I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
L562766	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What was your weakness, sir?
L562765	u3074	m201	LOW	He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
L562764	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He's moved on to TV.
L562763	u3074	m201	LOW	He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
L562762	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
L562761	u3074	m201	LOW	How's the arm?
L562760	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
L562759	u3074	m201	LOW	Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
L562752	u3074	m201	LOW	When you exit, head east on 10th.
L562751	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes, sir.
L562750	u3074	m201	LOW	This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
L562749	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes.
L562748	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent Mackelway?
L562398	u3074	m201	LOW	I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
L562397	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Who are you?
L562396	u3074	m201	LOW	The little piggie speaks.
L562395	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How did you know Speck was a killer?
L562734	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
L562733	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
L562732	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
L562731	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want to go live with you.
L562730	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[What does the file say?]
L562729	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
L562728	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[You tell me.]
L562727	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
L562726	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
L562725	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
L562724	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Not the heart, the watch.]
L562723	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want to help you.
L562722	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
L562721	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let's talk about Zero.
L562717	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
L562716	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
L562674	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
L562673	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
L562672	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
L562671	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	If I owe, I will go.
L562670	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
L562669	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've been to Chicago.
L562667	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Follow me.]
L562666	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Lead the way, Murman.
L562665	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
L562659	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Something came up, Murman, my man.
L562658	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Lionheart, what happened?]
L562532	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Whatever happened to MyDick?
L562531	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Reality very risky.]
L562478	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
L562477	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
L562894	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
L562893	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
L562892	u3077	m201	SALINAS	What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
L562891	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I don't think you understand.
L562887	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
L562886	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
L562885	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
L562884	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
L562883	u3077	m201	SALINAS	350 miles.
L562882	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How far is Amarillo?
L562420	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
L562419	u3077	m201	SALINAS	But why attack an Agent?
L562359	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I talked to him.
L562358	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Speck is dead.
L562357	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the ""item"" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick."
L562356	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I don't...
L562355	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
L562354	u3077	m201	SALINAS	MyDick?
L562302	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
L562301	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No.
L562266	u3077	m201	SALINAS	The same.
L562265	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Koessler?
L562264	u3077	m201	SALINAS	This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
L562263	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
L562224	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
L562223	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes, sir.
L562222	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
L562219	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
L562218	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
L562217	u3077	m201	SALINAS	This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
L562216	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
L562215	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Attitude Adjustment Issues -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
L562214	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Four hundred and sixty, sir.
L562213	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
L562212	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I screwed up twice, sir.
L562211	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center. Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
L562210	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Sounds like fun.
L562209	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
L562208	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
L562207	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Thomas Mackelway.
L562206	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
L562205	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I believe it's in my file, sir.
L562204	u3077	m201	SALINAS	What did you do to end up here?
L562203	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes, sir.
L562202	u3077	m201	SALINAS	So you're the new meat?
L562201	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
L562978	u3078	m201	ZERO	Take your shirt off.
L562977	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	It's over for you.
L562976	u3078	m201	ZERO	"You want to ""profile"" me? Find out what makes me ""tick""? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?"
L562972	u3078	m201	ZERO	Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
L562971	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
L562970	u3078	m201	ZERO	Murman!
L562969	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
L589057	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
L589056	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Look.
L589055	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Is anyone there?
L589052	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Then go.
L589051	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L589050	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
L589049	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
L589048	u3162	m208	ANNIE	That's up to you.
L589047	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Do you think I should go?
L589045	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
L589044	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
L589043	u3171	m208	MELANIE	He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
L589039	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
L589038	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And the second?
L589037	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
L589036	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I did.
L589035	u3162	m208	ANNIE	No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
L589034	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm sorry. Forgive me.
L589033	u3162	m208	ANNIE	You get straight to the point, don't you?
L589032	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
L589031	u3162	m208	ANNIE	So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
L589030	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I see.
L589029	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
L589028	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
L589027	u3162	m208	ANNIE	She already has a daughter.
L589026	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
L589025	u3162	m208	ANNIE	No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
L589024	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
L589023	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
L589022	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't understand.
L589021	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Afraid I'd give Mitch.
L589020	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Afraid you'd take Mitch?
L589019	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Because she was afraid.
L589018	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Then why did she object to you?
L589017	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
L589016	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Then what was it?
L589015	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
L589014	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And what had you done?
L589013	u3162	m208	ANNIE	When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
L589012	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
L589011	u3171	m208	MELANIE	A trifle.
L589010	u3162	m208	ANNIE	With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
L589009	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Different?
L589008	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
L589007	u3171	m208	MELANIE	When was this?
L589006	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
L589005	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What do you mean?
L589004	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
L589003	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
L589002	u3162	m208	ANNIE	You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
L589001	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I suspected as much.
L589000	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I guess you knew that, anyway.
L588998	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
L588997	u3171	m208	MELANIE	How'd you happen to come here?
L588996	u3162	m208	ANNIE	San Francisco.
L588995	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Where are you from originally, Annie?
L588994	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
L588993	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I despise it.
L588992	u3162	m208	ANNIE	How do you like our little hamlet?
L588991	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I think so.
L588990	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Or would you rather I changed the subject?
L588987	u3162	m208	ANNIE	It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
L588986	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Thank you.
L588985	u3162	m208	ANNIE	All right. 
L588984	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
L588983	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
L588982	u3171	m208	MELANIE	If you have some, I'd...
L588981	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Would you like some brandy?
L588980	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
L588979	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
L588978	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588977	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Miss Daniels? Is that you?
L588847	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
L588846	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
L588845	u3162	m208	ANNIE	It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
L588844	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
L588843	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
L588842	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
L588841	u3171	m208	MELANIE	That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
L588840	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Yes?
L588839	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I was wondering...
L588838	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, I did.
L588837	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
L588736	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Thank you.
L588735	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
L588734	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Lovebirds.
L588733	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
L588731	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I guess that's where everyone meets him.
L588730	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588729	u3162	m208	ANNIE	It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
L588728	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588727	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Did you drive up from San Francisco?
L588724	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Actually, it's none of my business.
L588723	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
L588722	u3162	m208	ANNIE	You're leaving after you see Cathy?
L588721	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No. Just a few hours.
L588720	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
L588719	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It's a lovely garden.
L588718	u3162	m208	ANNIE	I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
L588717	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, not really.
L588716	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Are you a friend of Mitch's?
L588714	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
L588713	u3171	m208	MELANIE	They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
L588712	u3162	m208	ANNIE	That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
L588711	u3171	m208	MELANIE	The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
L588710	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Cathy?
L588709	u3171	m208	MELANIE	The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
L588708	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Yes?
L588707	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
L588706	u3162	m208	ANNIE	Yes?
L588705	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Miss Hayworth?
L589639	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Take them.
L589638	u3163	m208	CATHY	They haven't harmed anyone.
L589570	u3168	m208	LYDIA	They're birds!
L589569	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mom, they're in a cage!
L589568	u3168	m208	LYDIA	No!
L589567	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
L589555	u3168	m208	LYDIA	If your father were here...
L589554	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mother!
L589130	u3163	m208	CATHY	Just listen to them!
L589129	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Yes, I did.
L588880	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
L588879	u3168	m208	LYDIA	In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
L588878	u3163	m208	CATHY	Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
L588877	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Cathy!
L588876	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
L588871	u3168	m208	LYDIA	No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
L588870	u3163	m208	CATHY	It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
L588869	u3168	m208	LYDIA	He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
L588900	u3163	m208	CATHY	If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
L588899	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
L588898	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
L588897	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't know yet.
L588896	u3163	m208	CATHY	Don't you like Bodega Bay?
L588895	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Darling, of course I do!
L588894	u3163	m208	CATHY	Don't you like us?
L588893	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
L588892	u3163	m208	CATHY	Are you coming to my party?
L588891	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I know.
L588890	u3163	m208	CATHY	Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
L588889	u3163	m208	CATHY	Just a little one.
L588888	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't think your mother would like that.
L588887	u3163	m208	CATHY	Could I have a puff?
L588886	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Oh, I suppose so.
L588885	u3163	m208	CATHY	Is smoking fun?
L588873	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Your brother told me.
L588872	u3163	m208	CATHY	I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
L588856	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well, I suppose...
L588855	u3163	m208	CATHY	They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
L588854	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes?
L588853	u3163	m208	CATHY	Miss Daniels?
L589657	u3172	m208	MITCH	I think they'll be all right, honey.
L589656	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
L589647	u3172	m208	MITCH	Shhh. Shhhhh.
L589646	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mitch, let's turn back.
L589607	u3163	m208	CATHY	Is she all right?
L589606	u3172	m208	MITCH	Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
L589575	u3172	m208	MITCH	I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
L589574	u3163	m208	CATHY	Why are they trying to kill people?
L589573	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know, honey.
L589572	u3163	m208	CATHY	Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
L589128	u3163	m208	CATHY	Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
L589127	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
L589124	u3172	m208	MITCH	That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
L589123	u3163	m208	CATHY	We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
L589119	u3163	m208	CATHY	What's the matter with them?
L589118	u3172	m208	MITCH	Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
L589117	u3163	m208	CATHY	Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
L589116	u3172	m208	MITCH	She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
L589115	u3163	m208	CATHY	Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
L588690	u3164	m208	CLERK	It's Alice.
L588689	u3166	m208	HARRY'S VOICE	No, it's Lois!
L588688	u3164	m208	CLERK	It's Alice, ain't it?
L588687	u3166	m208	HARRY'S VOICE	Lois!
L588686	u3164	m208	CLERK	The little Brenner girl.
L588685	u3166	m208	HARRY'S VOICE	What?
L588701	u3164	m208	CLERK	It's nothing.
L588700	u3171	m208	MELANIE	How much for the phone calls?
L588699	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
L588698	u3164	m208	CLERK	Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
L588697	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Thank you.
L588696	u3164	m208	CLERK	Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
L588695	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes?
L588694	u3164	m208	CLERK	That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
L588693	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I need her exact name, you see.
L588692	u3164	m208	CLERK	Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
L588691	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Are you sure?
L588684	u3164	m208	CLERK	Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
L588683	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588682	u3164	m208	CLERK	The little Brenner girl?
L588681	u3171	m208	MELANIE	The little girl's name.
L588680	u3164	m208	CLERK	Yep?
L588679	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I wonder if you could tell me...
L588678	u3164	m208	CLERK	Okay.
L588677	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Daniels.
L588676	u3164	m208	CLERK	What name?
L588675	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Thank you.
L588674	u3164	m208	CLERK	D'you want me to order one for you?
L588673	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Of course.
L588672	u3164	m208	CLERK	Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
L588671	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Where would I get a boat?
L588670	u3164	m208	CLERK	Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
L588669	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It's a surprise, you see.
L588668	u3164	m208	CLERK	Mmmm.
L588667	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
L588666	u3164	m208	CLERK	Mmmm.
L588665	u3171	m208	MELANIE	You see, I wanted to surprise them.
L588664	u3164	m208	CLERK	Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
L588663	u3171	m208	MELANIE	The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
L588662	u3164	m208	CLERK	Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
L588661	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I see. How do I get down there?
L588660	u3164	m208	CLERK	Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
L588659	u3171	m208	MELANIE	The two kids?
L588658	u3164	m208	CLERK	Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
L588657	u3171	m208	MELANIE	The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
L588656	u3171	m208	MELANIE	That's where the Brenners live.
L588655	u3164	m208	CLERK	And the white house?
L588654	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes?
L588653	u3164	m208	CLERK	See them two big trees across there?
L588652	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes?
L588651	u3164	m208	CLERK	See where I'm pointing?
L588650	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Where?
L588649	u3164	m208	CLERK	Right across the bay there.
L588648	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, but where?
L588647	u3164	m208	CLERK	Right here. Bodega Bay.
L588646	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Where does he live?
L588645	u3164	m208	CLERK	Yep.
L588644	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Do you know him?
L588643	u3164	m208	CLERK	Yep.
L588642	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
L588641	u3164	m208	CLERK	Try my best.
L588640	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I wonder if you could help me.
L588639	u3164	m208	CLERK	Morning.
L588638	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Good morning.
L589494	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Birds are not bad!
L589493	u3165	m208	DEKE	What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
L589393	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
L589392	u3165	m208	DEKE	Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
L589341	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
L589340	u3165	m208	DEKE	I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
L589327	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Impossible.
L589326	u3165	m208	DEKE	Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
L589320	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
L589319	u3165	m208	DEKE	I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
L589500	u3172	m208	MITCH	They're back!
L589499	u3165	m208	DEKE	Gulls!
L589488	u3172	m208	MITCH	We'll make our own fog.
L589487	u3165	m208	DEKE	We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
L588755	u3165	m208	DEKE	Well, you're the lawyer. 
L588754	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
L588753	u3165	m208	DEKE	I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
L588752	u3172	m208	MITCH	Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
L588751	u3165	m208	DEKE	You cut yourself outside, Miss?
L588750	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
L588749	u3165	m208	DEKE	Shall I call the doctor?
L588748	u3172	m208	MITCH	Young woman cut herself.
L588747	u3165	m208	DEKE	What happened?
L588746	u3172	m208	MITCH	Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
L589400	u3167	m208	HELEN	Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
L589399	u3176	m208	SHOLES	No. Here's fine. 
L589398	u3167	m208	HELEN	Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
L589376	u3176	m208	SHOLES	No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
L589375	u3167	m208	HELEN	One apple pie! You want more coffee?
L589374	u3176	m208	SHOLES	Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
L589373	u3167	m208	HELEN	Are you finished here, Sebastian?
L589635	u3172	m208	MITCH	You don't have to.
L589634	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I started to say... inside...
L589633	u3172	m208	MITCH	What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
L589632	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
L589631	u3172	m208	MITCH	We'll worry about that when we get there.
L589630	u3168	m208	LYDIA	If they are?
L589629	u3172	m208	MITCH	They won't be.
L589628	u3168	m208	LYDIA	If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
L589627	u3172	m208	MITCH	We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
L589626	u3168	m208	LYDIA	We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
L589625	u3172	m208	MITCH	I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
L589624	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
L589623	u3172	m208	MITCH	We won't be here.
L589622	u3168	m208	LYDIA	But they'll be back.
L589621	u3172	m208	MITCH	They're gone. The same pattern.
L589618	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I mean. I want to...
L589617	u3172	m208	MITCH	You're doing fine.
L589616	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
L589612	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I know you can.  But I'd like to.
L589611	u3172	m208	MITCH	I can handle it.
L589604	u3172	m208	MITCH	Get a rope!
L589603	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Oh, my God, look at her!
L589602	u3172	m208	MITCH	Mother, get a rope!
L589577	u3172	m208	MITCH	Shhh. Shhh.
L589576	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Mitch...
L589557	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I'm sorry, Mitch.
L589556	u3172	m208	MITCH	Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
L589553	u3168	m208	LYDIA	You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
L589552	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
L589551	u3168	m208	LYDIA	What happens when we run out of wood?
L589550	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
L589549	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Where will we go?
L589548	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know when.  We'll see what...
L589547	u3168	m208	LYDIA	When?
L589546	u3172	m208	MITCH	Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
L589545	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Maybe we ought to leave.
L589544	u3172	m208	MITCH	That's a chance we have to take.
L589543	u3168	m208	LYDIA	If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
L589542	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know.
L589541	u3168	m208	LYDIA	When do you think they'll come?
L589540	u3172	m208	MITCH	I got them all, Mother.
L589539	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
L589157	u3172	m208	MITCH	That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
L589156	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Tell him about the party.
L589097	u3172	m208	MITCH	I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
L589096	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Well... well, is everyone all right?
L588928	u3172	m208	MITCH	I know exactly what I want, Mother.
L588927	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
L588926	u3172	m208	MITCH	I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
L588925	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Yes?
L588924	u3172	m208	MITCH	Mother?
L588923	u3168	m208	LYDIA	It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
L588922	u3172	m208	MITCH	I know, Mother.
L588921	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
L588920	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes, Mother.
L588919	u3168	m208	LYDIA	She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
L588918	u3172	m208	MITCH	I know, Mother.
L588917	u3168	m208	LYDIA	You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
L588916	u3172	m208	MITCH	I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
L588915	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
L588914	u3172	m208	MITCH	Mother, where did you go to law school?
L588913	u3168	m208	LYDIA	But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
L588912	u3172	m208	MITCH	No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
L588911	u3168	m208	LYDIA	She was selling birds.
L588910	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes.
L588909	u3168	m208	LYDIA	In a bird shop.
L588908	u3172	m208	MITCH	I told you. We met yesterday.
L588907	u3168	m208	LYDIA	How long have you known her?
L588906	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes.
L588905	u3168	m208	LYDIA	And certainly pretty.
L588904	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes, very.
L588903	u3168	m208	LYDIA	She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
L588866	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
L588865	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'm simply quoting the law.
L588864	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Whose side are you on?
L588863	u3172	m208	MITCH	Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
L588862	u3168	m208	LYDIA	He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
L588861	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
L588860	u3168	m208	LYDIA	There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
L588827	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
L588826	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Seven o'clock, same as usual.
L588821	u3172	m208	MITCH	...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
L588820	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Lovebirds, I see.
L588819	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
L588818	u3168	m208	LYDIA	You did say birds?
L588815	u3172	m208	MITCH	Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
L588814	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Across at Brinkmeyer's.
L588813	u3172	m208	MITCH	For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
L588812	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Oh. I see.
L588811	u3172	m208	MITCH	A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
L588810	u3168	m208	LYDIA	How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
L588809	u3172	m208	MITCH	Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
L588808	u3168	m208	LYDIA	A what?
L588807	u3172	m208	MITCH	I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
L588806	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
L589615	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Please.
L589614	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Shhhh. Shhhh.
L589613	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
L589566	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And locked it.
L589565	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Did you close the door?
L589564	u3171	m208	MELANIE	That's the last of it.
L589281	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
L589280	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Would you? I'd feel so much better.
L589279	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't mind, really.
L589278	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I couldn't ask you to.
L589277	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Would you like me to go for her?
L589276	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
L589275	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
L589274	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
L589273	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I think it might also matter to Mitch.
L589272	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
L589271	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And if you don't?
L589270	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
L589269	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
L589268	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
L589267	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Why, Mrs. Brenner?
L589266	u3168	m208	LYDIA	No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
L589265	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
L589264	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
L589263	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I wish I could be that way.
L589262	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L589261	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
L589260	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Annie's there. She'll be all right.
L589259	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
L589258	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
L589257	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
L589256	u3168	m208	LYDIA	I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
L589255	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No.
L589254	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Do I sound foolish to you?
L589253	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
L589252	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Cathy. At the school.
L589251	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What?
L589250	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Do you think Cathy's all right?
L589249	u3168	m208	LYDIA	What good will they do?
L589248	u3171	m208	MELANIE	He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
L589247	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Then he saw.
L589246	u3171	m208	MELANIE	He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
L589245	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
L589244	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
L589243	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Where's Mitch?
L589242	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Oh, thank you.
L589241	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
L589126	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
L589125	u3171	m208	MELANIE	If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
L588875	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, not exactly.
L588874	u3168	m208	LYDIA	Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
L589492	u3172	m208	MITCH	We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
L589491	u3169	m208	MALONE	There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
L589446	u3169	m208	MALONE	Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
L589445	u3172	m208	MITCH	He was killed last night. By birds.
L589174	u3169	m208	MALONE	Goodnight, Lydia.
L589173	u3172	m208	MITCH	Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
L589172	u3169	m208	MALONE	Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
L589166	u3169	m208	MALONE	No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
L589165	u3172	m208	MITCH	Does this room look silly?
L589159	u3172	m208	MITCH	Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
L589158	u3169	m208	MALONE	Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
L589155	u3169	m208	MALONE	What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
L589154	u3172	m208	MITCH	These birds were...
L589153	u3169	m208	MALONE	Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
L589152	u3169	m208	MALONE	My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
L589151	u3172	m208	MITCH	All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
L589150	u3169	m208	MALONE	What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
L589149	u3172	m208	MITCH	Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
L589148	u3169	m208	MALONE	I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
L589147	u3172	m208	MITCH	What are we going to do about it, Al?
L589146	u3169	m208	MALONE	'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
L589145	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
L589144	u3169	m208	MALONE	No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
L589143	u3172	m208	MITCH	Not by the thousands.
L589142	u3169	m208	MALONE	Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
L589141	u3172	m208	MITCH	We know what it is, Al.
L589140	u3169	m208	MALONE	That's a chimney swift, all right.
L588635	u3170	m208	MAN	I'm awfully sorry.
L588634	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
L588633	u3170	m208	MAN	I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
L588632	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Oh.
L588631	u3170	m208	MAN	About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
L588630	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Sixty...  Oh.
L588629	u3170	m208	MAN	Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
L588628	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Bodega Bay? Where's that?
L588627	u3170	m208	MAN	Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
L588626	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well, where did he go?
L588625	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well, I...
L588624	u3170	m208	MAN	Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
L588623	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Monday?
L588622	u3170	m208	MAN	He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
L588621	u3171	m208	MELANIE	That's all right.
L588620	u3170	m208	MAN	He's not home.
L588619	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588618	u3170	m208	MAN	Is that for Mitch Brenner?
L589650	u3172	m208	MITCH	I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
L589649	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Can we turn back?
L589643	u3172	m208	MITCH	We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
L589642	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
L589594	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No... wait.  Hold me.
L589593	u3172	m208	MITCH	We'd better light some of those lamps.
L589592	u3172	m208	MITCH	Wait here. Don't move.
L589591	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Mitch...
L589590	u3172	m208	MITCH	The power.
L589589	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
L589588	u3172	m208	MITCH	You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
L589585	u3172	m208	MITCH	How about you?
L589584	u3171	m208	MELANIE	You must be exhausted.
L589583	u3172	m208	MITCH	Almost two a.m.
L589582	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What time is it?
L589581	u3172	m208	MITCH	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
L589580	u3171	m208	MELANIE	When will they stop?
L589562	u3172	m208	MITCH	Maybe.
L589561	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Santa Rosa?
L589560	u3172	m208	MITCH	Inland.
L589559	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Where are they heading?
L589530	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
L589529	u3172	m208	MITCH	Have we still got power?
L589528	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
L589527	u3172	m208	MITCH	Do you want to try your father again? 
L589525	u3172	m208	MITCH	It may not be last week again for a long long time.
L589524	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
L589523	u3172	m208	MITCH	It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
L589522	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I keep thinking of Annie. 
L589521	u3172	m208	MITCH	The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
L589520	u3171	m208	MELANIE	How long have they been gathering there?
L589519	u3172	m208	MITCH	The bay doesn't.
L589518	u3171	m208	MELANIE	The town looks clear.
L589509	u3172	m208	MITCH	We've got to get Cathy.
L589508	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Don't let's take any chances.
L589507	u3172	m208	MITCH	I think it's safe to get out now.
L589442	u3171	m208	MELANIE	At Annie's house. She's all right.
L589441	u3172	m208	MITCH	I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
L589238	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
L589237	u3172	m208	MITCH	That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
L589221	u3171	m208	MELANIE	...everything I know.
L589220	u3172	m208	MITCH	Melanie...
L589219	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
L589218	u3172	m208	MITCH	No, no...
L589217	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm frightened, Mitch.
L589216	u3172	m208	MITCH	Melanie, Melanie...
L589213	u3172	m208	MITCH	No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
L589212	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
L589211	u3172	m208	MITCH	I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
L589210	u3171	m208	MELANIE	After the gulls attacked.
L589209	u3172	m208	MITCH	What do you mean?
L589208	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It was like that yesterday.
L589207	u3172	m208	MITCH	It's so damn quiet out there.
L589206	u3171	m208	MELANIE	With my little sparrow leading team.
L589205	u3172	m208	MITCH	They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
L589204	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Mmm?
L589203	u3172	m208	MITCH	What it was, probably...
L589202	u3171	m208	MELANIE	You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
L589201	u3172	m208	MITCH	Take wing!
L589200	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
L589199	u3172	m208	MITCH	Hear, hear!
L589198	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
L589197	u3172	m208	MITCH	Hear!
L589196	u3171	m208	MELANIE	"Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. ""Why should humans rule?"" they asked themselves."
L589195	u3172	m208	MITCH	Well, they'll go along with anything.
L589194	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
L589193	u3172	m208	MITCH	So they united.
L589192	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
L589191	u3172	m208	MITCH	Growing a beard...
L589190	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
L589189	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Certainly, of birds.
L589188	u3172	m208	MITCH	Of birds?
L589187	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It's an uprising.
L589186	u3172	m208	MITCH	Really? Tell me about it.
L589185	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
L589184	u3172	m208	MITCH	It smelled of the fire.
L589170	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I think I should, don't you?
L589169	u3172	m208	MITCH	Are you staying?
L589168	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'll take Cathy up to bed.
L589132	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'll get it.
L589131	u3172	m208	MITCH	Some cream?
L589114	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, thank you.
L589113	u3172	m208	MITCH	Do you want some mustard with this?
L589112	u3172	m208	MITCH	Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
L589111	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, I have my things in the car.
L589110	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
L589109	u3171	m208	MELANIE	A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
L589108	u3172	m208	MITCH	Last night? What do you mean?
L589107	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
L589106	u3172	m208	MITCH	You look a little shaken.
L589092	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L589091	u3172	m208	MITCH	Are you all right?
L589086	u3172	m208	MITCH	No, tell me.
L589085	u3171	m208	MELANIE	You'll think me very bold, sir.
L589084	u3172	m208	MITCH	What'll it say?
L589083	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
L589082	u3172	m208	MITCH	What?
L589081	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
L589080	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'm glad you do.
L589079	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
L589078	u3172	m208	MITCH	And Fridays? What do you do then?
L589077	u3171	m208	MELANIE	On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
L589076	u3172	m208	MITCH	What about Thursdays and Fridays?
L589075	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
L589074	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L589073	u3172	m208	MITCH	Helping travelers.
L589072	u3171	m208	MELANIE	On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
L589071	u3172	m208	MITCH	Like what?
L589070	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I do different things on different days.
L589069	u3172	m208	MITCH	What do you do?
L589068	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I have several jobs.
L589067	u3172	m208	MITCH	You have a job?
L589066	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
L589065	u3172	m208	MITCH	Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
L589064	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
L589063	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Cheers.
L589062	u3172	m208	MITCH	Cheers.
L589061	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
L589060	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
L589059	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
L588976	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
L588975	u3172	m208	MITCH	What do you want ?
L588974	u3171	m208	MELANIE	But not for me.
L588973	u3172	m208	MITCH	It is for me.
L588972	u3171	m208	MELANIE	That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
L588971	u3172	m208	MITCH	I think it could be fun.
L588970	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Why?
L588969	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'd still like to see you.
L588968	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't give a damn what you believe!
L588967	u3172	m208	MITCH	Do you expect me to believe...?
L588966	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I told you what happened in Rome!
L588965	u3172	m208	MITCH	Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
L588964	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
L588963	u3172	m208	MITCH	Why?
L588962	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588961	u3172	m208	MITCH	But you tore it up.
L588960	u3171	m208	MELANIE	"It said, ""Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality."" That's what it said."
L588959	u3172	m208	MITCH	What did it say?
L588958	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I wrote the letter.
L588957	u3172	m208	MITCH	Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
L588956	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, I was lying.
L588955	u3172	m208	MITCH	You were lying.
L588954	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No.
L588953	u3172	m208	MITCH	And you didn't come up here to see her.
L588952	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No.
L588951	u3172	m208	MITCH	So you didn't go to school together.
L588950	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
L588949	u3172	m208	MITCH	Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
L588948	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
L588947	u3172	m208	MITCH	...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
L588946	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588945	u3172	m208	MITCH	...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
L588944	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, but...
L588943	u3172	m208	MITCH	The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
L588942	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
L588941	u3172	m208	MITCH	You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
L588940	u3171	m208	MELANIE	With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
L588939	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Without any clothes on?
L588938	u3171	m208	MELANIE	In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
L588937	u3172	m208	MITCH	Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
L588936	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Oh. That. Rome.
L588935	u3172	m208	MITCH	I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
L588934	u3171	m208	MELANIE	How does Mother know what I like to do?
L588933	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
L588932	u3171	m208	MELANIE	San Francisco's a long way from here.
L588931	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Will I be seeing you again?
L588930	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Oh, yes.
L588929	u3172	m208	MITCH	You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
L588884	u3172	m208	MITCH	His wife changed the channel.
L588883	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What?
L588882	u3172	m208	MITCH	He was watching a ball game on television.
L588881	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Why did he shoot her?
L588859	u3172	m208	MITCH	Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
L588858	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Famished.
L588857	u3172	m208	MITCH	Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
L588834	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Maybe.
L588833	u3172	m208	MITCH	Seven o'clock then.
L588832	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm sure.
L588831	u3172	m208	MITCH	You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
L588830	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
L588829	u3172	m208	MITCH	Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
L588828	u3171	m208	MELANIE	With... with Annie, of course.
L588825	u3172	m208	MITCH	Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
L588824	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Certainly, but...
L588823	u3172	m208	MITCH	You are, aren't you?
L588822	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, but...
L588817	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
L588816	u3172	m208	MITCH	After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
L588804	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Look, Mr. Brenner...
L588803	u3172	m208	MITCH	Right next to the one you already had.
L588802	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
L588801	u3172	m208	MITCH	But you were coming up anyway, remember?
L588800	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
L588799	u3172	m208	MITCH	Can't see a thing.
L588798	u3171	m208	MELANIE	None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
L588797	u3172	m208	MITCH	What did it say?
L588796	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
L588795	u3172	m208	MITCH	You like me, huh?
L588794	u3171	m208	MELANIE	It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
L588793	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
L588792	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Why would I want to see you, of all people?
L588791	u3172	m208	MITCH	I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
L588790	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588789	u3172	m208	MITCH	So you came up to see Annie, huh?
L588787	u3172	m208	MITCH	It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
L588786	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Oh, no you don't!
L588785	u3172	m208	MITCH	I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
L588784	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
L588783	u3172	m208	MITCH	Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
L588782	u3171	m208	MELANIE	We... we went to school together. College.
L588781	u3172	m208	MITCH	How do you know Annie?
L588780	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588779	u3172	m208	MITCH	Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
L588778	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Annie. Annie Hayworth.
L588777	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes?
L588776	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Why... 
L588775	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
L588774	u3171	m208	MELANIE	To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
L588773	u3172	m208	MITCH	What for?
L588772	u3171	m208	MELANIE	To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
L588771	u3172	m208	MITCH	You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
L588770	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Didn't you see the lovebirds?
L588769	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
L588768	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Ouch!
L588766	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Only violators and practical jokers.
L588765	u3172	m208	MITCH	Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
L588764	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
L588763	u3172	m208	MITCH	Criminal.
L588762	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What kind of law?
L588761	u3172	m208	MITCH	No, San Francisco. What are you...?
L588760	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Do you practice here?
L588759	u3172	m208	MITCH	That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
L588758	u3171	m208	MELANIE	So you're a lawyer.
L588757	u3172	m208	MITCH	Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
L588756	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What's that?
L588739	u3172	m208	MITCH	It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
L588738	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What made it...
L588737	u3172	m208	MITCH	That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
L588601	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
L588600	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
L588599	u3172	m208	MITCH	I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
L588598	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I think you're a louse.
L588597	u3172	m208	MITCH	Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
L588596	u3171	m208	MELANIE	You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
L588595	u3172	m208	MITCH	Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
L588594	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
L588593	u3172	m208	MITCH	I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
L588592	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What are you? A policeman?
L588591	u3172	m208	MITCH	No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
L588590	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I didn't break that window!
L588589	u3172	m208	MITCH	Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
L588588	u3171	m208	MELANIE	When?
L588587	u3172	m208	MITCH	That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
L588586	u3171	m208	MELANIE	We never met in court or anyplace else.
L588585	u3172	m208	MITCH	We met in court.
L588584	u3171	m208	MELANIE	How?
L588583	u3172	m208	MITCH	Ahhh, but I know you.
L588582	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't know you.
L588581	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Hey, wait a minute!
L588580	u3172	m208	MITCH	A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
L588579	u3171	m208	MELANIE	But how... how do you know my name?
L588578	u3172	m208	MITCH	I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
L588577	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What did you say?
L588568	u3172	m208	MITCH	All right.  She smiles back.
L588567	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
L588566	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
L588565	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
L588564	u3172	m208	MITCH	How can you tell?
L588563	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Some of them are.
L588562	u3172	m208	MITCH	Are they moulting now?
L588561	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
L588560	u3172	m208	MITCH	I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
L588559	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
L588558	u3172	m208	MITCH	I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
L588557	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
L588556	u3172	m208	MITCH	All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
L588555	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Doesn't what make me...?
L588554	u3172	m208	MITCH	Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
L588553	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
L588552	u3172	m208	MITCH	The sign says strawberry finches.
L588551	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, sir, those are... redbirds.
L588550	u3172	m208	MITCH	Aren't these lovebirds?
L588549	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
L588548	u3172	m208	MITCH	Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
L588547	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, of course not.
L588546	u3172	m208	MITCH	As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
L588545	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I understand completely, sir.
L588544	u3172	m208	MITCH	These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
L588543	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well... yes, sir, there are.
L588542	u3172	m208	MITCH	Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
L588541	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Lovebirds, sir?
L588540	u3172	m208	MITCH	Lovebirds.
L588539	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
L588538	u3172	m208	MITCH	I said I wonder if you could help me.
L588537	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What?
L588536	u3172	m208	MITCH	I wonder if you could help me.
L588615	u3171	m208	MELANIE	That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
L588614	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
L588613	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
L588612	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Well... well, how soon would you want them?
L588611	u3171	m208	MELANIE	How soon?
L588610	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
L588609	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Do you have any lovebirds?
L588608	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Yes, certainly. 
L588607	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
L588606	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
L588605	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	What? Oh, yes, certainly.
L588604	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Have you got a pencil?
L588603	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	I have no idea.
L588602	u3171	m208	MELANIE	That... that... who was that?
L588575	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
L588574	u3171	m208	MELANIE	There we are!
L588534	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well, all right, but...
L588533	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
L588532	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Oh. Oh, well, all right.
L588531	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
L588530	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
L588529	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes.
L588528	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
L588527	u3171	m208	MELANIE	And he'll talk?
L588526	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
L588525	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
L588524	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
L588523	u3171	m208	MELANIE	You said three o'clock.
L588522	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
L588520	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What do you suppose it is?
L588519	u3174	m208	MRS. MACGRUDER	Hello, Miss Daniels.
L588518	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
L589414	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
L589413	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Maybe! Is it impossible?
L589412	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
L589389	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
L589388	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
L589387	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
L589386	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
L589385	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
L589370	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No one called it a war!
L589369	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
L589368	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
L589367	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I don't know why.
L589365	u3171	m208	MELANIE	To...  To kill them.
L589364	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	For what purpose?
L589363	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Daniels. I think they were after the children.
L589362	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	What do you think they were after, Miss...?
L589361	u3171	m208	MELANIE	What were the crows after at the school?
L589360	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
L589339	u3171	m208	MELANIE	These weren't a few birds.
L589338	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
L589337	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
L589325	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
L589324	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
L589322	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
L589321	u3171	m208	MELANIE	I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
L589317	u3171	m208	MELANIE	Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
L589316	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
L589315	u3171	m208	MELANIE	They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
L589314	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
L589313	u3171	m208	MELANIE	No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
L589496	u3172	m208	MITCH	Can we go on living here otherwise?
L589495	u3176	m208	SHOLES	How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
L589490	u3172	m208	MITCH	With smoke.
L589489	u3176	m208	SHOLES	How do you plan to do that?
L589486	u3172	m208	MITCH	Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
L589485	u3176	m208	SHOLES	How?
L589484	u3172	m208	MITCH	I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
L589481	u3176	m208	SHOLES	If you don't even know what you want to do...
L589480	u3172	m208	MITCH	I'm not sure, but...
L589479	u3176	m208	SHOLES	Help how? What do you want to do?
L589478	u3172	m208	MITCH	Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
L589477	u3176	m208	SHOLES	I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
L589476	u3172	m208	MITCH	It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
L589475	u3176	m208	SHOLES	No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
L589474	u3172	m208	MITCH	Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
L589473	u3176	m208	SHOLES	Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
L589466	u3172	m208	MITCH	I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
L589465	u3176	m208	SHOLES	No one ever said you were, Mitch.
L589464	u3172	m208	MITCH	Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
L589457	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
L589456	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
L589455	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
L589395	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
L589394	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
L589391	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	That would hardly be possible.
L589390	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
L589384	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	They are incapable of organized warfare!
L589383	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	Not if they're starting a war.
L589382	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	We need them.
L589381	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
L589380	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Birds?
L589372	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
L589371	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	Scotch, light on the water.
L589406	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
L589405	u3176	m208	SHOLES	Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
L589404	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Of course.
L589403	u3176	m208	SHOLES	Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
L589345	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
L589344	u3176	m208	SHOLES	The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
L589343	u3173	m208	MRS. BUNDY	Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
L589342	u3176	m208	SHOLES	How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
L589459	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
L589458	u3177	m208	WOMAN	I'm leaving! Are you coming?
L589454	u3177	m208	WOMAN	Can't you please finish your drink?
L589453	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
L589450	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
L589449	u3177	m208	WOMAN	Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
L589437	u3177	m208	WOMAN	Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
L589436	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	I haven't finished my drink.
L589435	u3177	m208	WOMAN	Then let's go. Now!
L589434	u3175	m208	SALESMAN	I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
L589927	u3178	m209	FETTES	Good morning.
L589926	u3180	m209	GRAY	Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
L589879	u3178	m209	FETTES	Good.
L589878	u3180	m209	GRAY	There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
L589875	u3180	m209	GRAY	How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
L589874	u3178	m209	FETTES	But can't you give me any idea?
L589873	u3180	m209	GRAY	I fear he may have to.
L589751	u3180	m209	GRAY	Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
L589750	u3178	m209	FETTES	Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
L589749	u3180	m209	GRAY	That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
L589748	u3178	m209	FETTES	Mr. Gray?
L589747	u3180	m209	GRAY	I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
L589746	u3178	m209	FETTES	I'm Donald Fettes.
L590139	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	It is a pity.
L590138	u3178	m209	FETTES	Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
L590132	u3178	m209	FETTES	It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
L590131	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
L590125	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
L590124	u3178	m209	FETTES	Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
L589830	u3178	m209	FETTES	Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
L589829	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
L589828	u3178	m209	FETTES	Yes.
L589827	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	You have his promise, then?
L589771	u3178	m209	FETTES	Of course I will.
L589770	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	Ask this one favor --
L589769	u3178	m209	FETTES	I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
L589768	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	Did he tell you about Georgina?
L589767	u3178	m209	FETTES	I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
L589766	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
L589765	u3178	m209	FETTES	I'm only a student.
L589764	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	I want you to help my little girl.
L589763	u3178	m209	FETTES	You asked to see me, ma'am?
L590152	u3183	m209	MEG	And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
L590151	u3178	m209	FETTES	At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
L590150	u3183	m209	MEG	There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
L590149	u3178	m209	FETTES	But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
L590148	u3183	m209	MEG	You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
L590147	u3178	m209	FETTES	Where can I find him?
L590146	u3183	m209	MEG	He's not home.
L590079	u3183	m209	MEG	It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
L590078	u3178	m209	FETTES	I've heard of it.
L590077	u3183	m209	MEG	Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
L590076	u3178	m209	FETTES	MacFarlane
L590075	u3183	m209	MEG	That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
L590074	u3183	m209	MEG	They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
L590073	u3178	m209	FETTES	Aye.
L590072	u3183	m209	MEG	And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
L590071	u3178	m209	FETTES	I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
L590070	u3183	m209	MEG	Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
L590069	u3178	m209	FETTES	But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
L590068	u3183	m209	MEG	If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
L590067	u3178	m209	FETTES	But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
L590066	u3183	m209	MEG	I'm cold as ice.
L590065	u3178	m209	FETTES	You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
L590064	u3183	m209	MEG	He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
L590063	u3183	m209	MEG	Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
L590062	u3178	m209	FETTES	He's a great doctor -- a great man --
L590061	u3183	m209	MEG	Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
L590060	u3178	m209	FETTES	I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
L590059	u3183	m209	MEG	You must leave this house.
L590198	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
L590197	u3178	m209	FETTES	It was a woman when we put her in.
L590196	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	This is not a woman!
L590185	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
L590184	u3178	m209	FETTES	Where shall we put it? In the back?
L590181	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
L590180	u3178	m209	FETTES	No.
L590179	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
L590178	u3178	m209	FETTES	You couldn't do that, Doctor.
L590177	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
L590176	u3178	m209	FETTES	You've no thought of going there?
L590175	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
L590174	u3178	m209	FETTES	They'll be thinking of that, too.
L590173	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
L590172	u3178	m209	FETTES	A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
L590171	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	See that, Fettes?
L590165	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Gray -- I'm rid of him --
L590164	u3178	m209	FETTES	What?
L590163	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
L590162	u3178	m209	FETTES	The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
L590161	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	What's that you say?
L590054	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
L590053	u3178	m209	FETTES	I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
L590052	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	What do you mean, Fettes?
L590051	u3178	m209	FETTES	No.
L590050	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
L589940	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
L589939	u3178	m209	FETTES	But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
L589938	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
L589935	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
L589934	u3178	m209	FETTES	I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
L589933	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
L589932	u3178	m209	FETTES	Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
L589931	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
L589930	u3178	m209	FETTES	I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
L589929	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
L589928	u3178	m209	FETTES	I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
L589907	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Pulse?
L589906	u3178	m209	FETTES	She's unconscious.
L589904	u3178	m209	FETTES	Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
L589903	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
L589898	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
L589897	u3178	m209	FETTES	But, I didn't ask him to kill.
L589896	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
L589895	u3178	m209	FETTES	I can't believe that.
L589894	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
L589893	u3178	m209	FETTES	Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
L589892	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
L589891	u3178	m209	FETTES	I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
L589890	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	We can't be sure of that.
L589889	u3178	m209	FETTES	Gray killed her.
L589888	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Well --
L589884	u3178	m209	FETTES	This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
L589883	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
L589862	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
L589861	u3178	m209	FETTES	Yes, I suppose so.
L589860	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You see, it is completely out of the question.
L589859	u3178	m209	FETTES	Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
L589858	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	"Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any ""subjects""?"
L589857	u3178	m209	FETTES	But you did promise.
L589856	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
L589855	u3178	m209	FETTES	But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
L589854	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
L589853	u3178	m209	FETTES	It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
L589807	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
L589806	u3178	m209	FETTES	She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
L589805	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I remember her.
L589804	u3178	m209	FETTES	Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
L589791	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
L589790	u3178	m209	FETTES	But this woman -- and her son --
L589788	u3178	m209	FETTES	Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
L589787	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
L589786	u3178	m209	FETTES	I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
L589785	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
L589784	u3178	m209	FETTES	I don't think I can go on, sir.
L589743	u3178	m209	FETTES	From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
L589742	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
L589731	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
L589730	u3178	m209	FETTES	But Richardson?
L589729	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Well? And are you not a good student?
L589728	u3178	m209	FETTES	I thought only the best students were made assistants.
L589727	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
L589726	u3178	m209	FETTES	I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
L589725	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You're made for a doctor, young man!
L589724	u3178	m209	FETTES	I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
L589712	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Excuse me.
L589711	u3178	m209	FETTES	Dr. MacFarlane --
L589698	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
L589697	u3178	m209	FETTES	But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
L589696	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Come in, boy -- come in.
L589695	u3178	m209	FETTES	Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
L590143	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	I wanted to see the white horse --
L590142	u3178	m209	FETTES	You'll not need that again, Georgina.
L590127	u3178	m209	FETTES	I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
L590126	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	I thought this was a school day.
L589937	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	I can't.
L589936	u3178	m209	FETTES	Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
L589846	u3178	m209	FETTES	But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
L589845	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	I want it --
L589844	u3178	m209	FETTES	Aye, but I still wonder how much.
L589842	u3178	m209	FETTES	One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
L589841	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
L589840	u3178	m209	FETTES	Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
L589839	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	He was a nice horse.
L589838	u3178	m209	FETTES	"Why do you want the white horse to bid you ""good-day""?"
L589835	u3178	m209	FETTES	An old acquaintance, eh?
L589834	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
L589833	u3178	m209	FETTES	Hear him?
L589705	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	Well --
L589704	u3178	m209	FETTES	Why, yes.
L589703	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
L589701	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
L589700	u3178	m209	FETTES	Not yet.
L589699	u3179	m209	GEORGINA	Are you a doctor, too?
L589668	u3178	m209	FETTES	A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
L589667	u3184	m209	MRS. MACBRIDE	A doctor?
L589666	u3178	m209	FETTES	I'm by way of being a medical myself.
L589665	u3184	m209	MRS. MACBRIDE	They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
L589664	u3178	m209	FETTES	Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
L589662	u3178	m209	FETTES	Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
L589661	u3184	m209	MRS. MACBRIDE	He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
L590109	u3180	m209	GRAY	No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
L590108	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	A pleasure to torment me?
L590107	u3180	m209	GRAY	Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
L590106	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	But why, Gray? Why?
L590105	u3180	m209	GRAY	But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
L590104	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
L590102	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
L590101	u3180	m209	GRAY	It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
L590100	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I would make you rich.
L590099	u3180	m209	GRAY	Would you bribe me to leave you be?
L590098	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
L590097	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
L590096	u3180	m209	GRAY	I have other means of sustenance.
L590095	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
L590093	u3180	m209	GRAY	Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
L590092	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I've drunk enough tonight.
L590091	u3180	m209	GRAY	Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
L590090	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	We have never been friends.
L590089	u3180	m209	GRAY	Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
L590086	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
L590085	u3180	m209	GRAY	So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
L590084	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
L590040	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
L590039	u3180	m209	GRAY	Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
L590038	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Get out of here!
L590037	u3180	m209	GRAY	This is a gift you'll not return.
L590036	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I take no gifts from you.
L590035	u3180	m209	GRAY	This is a gift.
L590034	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I've ordered nothing from you.
L590033	u3180	m209	GRAY	I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
L590030	u3180	m209	GRAY	Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
L590029	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	What are you going here? Have I not told you --
L589984	u3180	m209	GRAY	I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
L589983	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
L589982	u3180	m209	GRAY	Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
L589981	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
L589980	u3180	m209	GRAY	I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
L589979	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
L589977	u3180	m209	GRAY	Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
L589976	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
L589974	u3180	m209	GRAY	You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
L589973	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	In the brain, I tell you. I know.
L589972	u3180	m209	GRAY	But what makes a thought start?
L589971	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	The nerve centers -- the brain --
L589970	u3180	m209	GRAY	Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
L589969	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	The heart pumps it.
L589968	u3180	m209	GRAY	Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
L589967	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
L589966	u3180	m209	GRAY	And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
L589965	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
L589964	u3180	m209	GRAY	You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
L589962	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	The same. Look here, Gray --
L589961	u3180	m209	GRAY	Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
L589960	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
L589959	u3180	m209	GRAY	I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
L589958	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
L589957	u3180	m209	GRAY	I've had some experience.
L589956	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You know something about the human body, Gray.
L589954	u3180	m209	GRAY	You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
L589953	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
L589919	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
L589918	u3180	m209	GRAY	You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
L589917	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
L589916	u3180	m209	GRAY	Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
L589824	u3180	m209	GRAY	Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
L589823	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
L589822	u3180	m209	GRAY	Toddy hates me.
L589820	u3180	m209	GRAY	That's a good boy, Toddy.
L589819	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	It might be an interesting case.
L589818	u3180	m209	GRAY	Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
L589817	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	No.
L589816	u3180	m209	GRAY	Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
L589815	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I'll not do it, Gray.
L589814	u3180	m209	GRAY	I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
L589813	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
L589812	u3180	m209	GRAY	Why don't you do it then?
L589811	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I am the best man for the job.
L589810	u3180	m209	GRAY	Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
L589809	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Afraid of what?
L589808	u3180	m209	GRAY	You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
L589803	u3180	m209	GRAY	You will not have it?
L589802	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I will not have you use that name to me.
L589798	u3180	m209	GRAY	Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
L589797	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
L589796	u3180	m209	GRAY	Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
L589795	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Don't call me that confounded name.
L589794	u3180	m209	GRAY	Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
L590020	u3180	m209	GRAY	"I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they ""Burked"" them."
L590019	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
L590018	u3180	m209	GRAY	Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest.
L590017	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
L590016	u3180	m209	GRAY	A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like.  Ah, how he cozened them.
L590015	u3180	m209	GRAY	That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
L590014	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	But where did they get those people?
L590013	u3180	m209	GRAY	Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
L590012	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	I never heard that song. But what did they do?
L590011	u3180	m209	GRAY	The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --
L590010	u3180	m209	GRAY	But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
L590009	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	I come from Lisbon.
L590008	u3180	m209	GRAY	You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
L590007	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	Burke them?
L590006	u3180	m209	GRAY	"No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will ""Burke"" them,"
L590005	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
L590004	u3180	m209	GRAY	You and I should work together.
L590000	u3180	m209	GRAY	No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
L589999	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
L589993	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	"Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the ""subjects."""
L589992	u3180	m209	GRAY	You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
L589991	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
L589990	u3180	m209	GRAY	Only Brother.
L589989	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	Can anyone hear what we say?
L589988	u3180	m209	GRAY	Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
L589987	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	Yes.
L589986	u3180	m209	GRAY	You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
L589925	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	I know --
L589924	u3180	m209	GRAY	What did you hear?
L589923	u3181	m209	JOSEPH	I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
L589922	u3180	m209	GRAY	I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
L589946	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
L589945	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	She would if she could.
L589944	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
L589943	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
L589723	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
L589722	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	There's nothing I can say for one small child?
L589721	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
L589720	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
L589719	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
L589715	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
L589714	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	But can anything be done for her?
L589710	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	Three years.
L589709	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	How long ago?
L589708	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
L589707	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
L589688	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
L589687	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
L589686	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Is her pain sporadic or constant?
L589685	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	Yes, Doctor.
L589684	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Any attacks of pain since?
L589683	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	Nearly a year.
L589682	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	How long after that was the paralysis complete?
L589681	u3185	m209	MRS. MARSH	No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
L589680	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Was the paralysis immediate?
L590116	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Aye.
L590115	u3183	m209	MEG	You've been with Gray again.
L590056	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	He must leave me alone.
L590055	u3183	m209	MEG	You're not going to Gray.
L590046	u3183	m209	MEG	I'll get him.
L590045	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Fettes -- where is Fettes?
L590032	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You can get out.
L590031	u3183	m209	MEG	Crony indeed!
L589851	u3183	m209	MEG	No great lady will ever take my place?
L589850	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
L589849	u3183	m209	MEG	You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
L589848	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
L589737	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
L589736	u3183	m209	MEG	Aye --
L589735	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
L589734	u3183	m209	MEG	Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
L589733	u3182	m209	MACFARLANE	And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
L596498	u3216	m212	SAM	What's Plan B?
L596497	u3208	m212	ALAN	Time to activate Plan B.
L596496	u3216	m212	SAM	Well... we blew Plan A.
L596483	u3216	m212	SAM	You gotta drive!
L596482	u3208	m212	ALAN	They're gaining on us!
L596471	u3208	m212	ALAN	We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
L596470	u3216	m212	SAM	Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
L596468	u3216	m212	SAM	Fine!  Stay here!
L596467	u3208	m212	ALAN	We don't ride with vampires.
L596466	u3216	m212	SAM	<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
L596334	u3216	m212	SAM	Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
L596333	u3208	m212	ALAN	They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
L596274	u3208	m212	ALAN	You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
L596273	u3216	m212	SAM	He's my brother.
L596272	u3208	m212	ALAN	Why not?
L596269	u3208	m212	ALAN	He's a vampire alright.
L596268	u3216	m212	SAM	Yeah.
L596267	u3208	m212	ALAN	Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
L596264	u3216	m212	SAM	Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
L596263	u3208	m212	ALAN	Can't stand light?
L596262	u3216	m212	SAM	All day.
L596157	u3216	m212	SAM	I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
L596156	u3208	m212	ALAN	Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
L596155	u3216	m212	SAM	I don't like horror comics.
L596153	u3216	m212	SAM	You better get some fresh air.
L596152	u3208	m212	ALAN	We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
L596149	u3216	m212	SAM	This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
L596148	u3208	m212	ALAN	Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
L596144	u3216	m212	SAM	It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
L596143	u3208	m212	ALAN	How do you like Santa Carla?
L596008	u3208	m212	ALAN	This one could save your life.
L596007	u3216	m212	SAM	I don't like horror comics.
L596005	u3216	m212	SAM	No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
L596004	u3208	m212	ALAN	Just passing through Santa Carla?
L596552	u3210	m212	EDGAR	The baddest!
L596551	u3208	m212	ALAN	The meanest!
L596550	u3210	m212	EDGAR	We are awesome monster-bashers!
L596549	u3208	m212	ALAN	Maximum body-count.
L596548	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Death to all vampires!
L596547	u3208	m212	ALAN	You know what?  You're absolutely right.
L596546	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
L596545	u3208	m212	ALAN	Whattaya mean?
L596544	u3210	m212	EDGAR	<u>Four</u> to go.
L596543	u3208	m212	ALAN	Two down and two to go.
L596542	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
L596541	u3208	m212	ALAN	Did you see that sucker burn?!
L596516	u3210	m212	EDGAR	That's just the way we like it.
L596515	u3208	m212	ALAN	Good.
L596487	u3208	m212	ALAN	They're gonna book us.
L596486	u3210	m212	EDGAR	They're looking at us.
L596474	u3210	m212	EDGAR	They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
L596473	u3208	m212	ALAN	We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
L596472	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Shut up!
L596433	u3210	m212	EDGAR	I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
L596432	u3208	m212	ALAN	Should I run him through?
L596429	u3210	m212	EDGAR	El Vampiro.
L596428	u3208	m212	ALAN	The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
L596427	u3210	m212	EDGAR	The Prince of Darkness.
L596426	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
L596336	u3208	m212	ALAN	Zero.
L596335	u3210	m212	EDGAR	All together?
L596326	u3210	m212	EDGAR	As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
L596325	u3208	m212	ALAN	Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
L596324	u3210	m212	EDGAR	We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
L596396	u3209	m212	DAVID	You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
L596395	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What is this, David?
L596394	u3209	m212	DAVID	If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
L596393	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Where's Star, David?!
L596392	u3209	m212	DAVID	Hey, take it easy.
L596391	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Where is she?!
L596194	u3209	m212	DAVID	What's goin' on, Marko?
L596193	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What's going' on?
L596178	u3209	m212	DAVID	Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
L596177	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'm my own man.
L596108	u3209	m212	DAVID	Why?  They're only noodles.
L596107	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't!  Stop!
L596102	u3209	m212	DAVID	You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
L596101	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What?...
L596100	u3209	m212	DAVID	So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
L596074	u3209	m212	DAVID	Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
L596073	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We were gonna grab some food.
L596066	u3209	m212	DAVID	You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
L596065	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I can't beat a Triumph.
L596063	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Star?...
L596062	u3209	m212	DAVID	C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
L596061	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	That's right.
L596060	u3209	m212	DAVID	Honda 250, huh?
L596059	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We still going?
L596565	u3209	m212	DAVID	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
L596564	u3217	m212	STAR	I will, David!
L596563	u3209	m212	DAVID	You can't kill me, Star.
L596176	u3209	m212	DAVID	You're almost one of us now, Michael.
L596175	u3217	m212	STAR	Look.
L596104	u3209	m212	DAVID	Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
L596103	u3217	m212	STAR	Leave him alone.
L596072	u3209	m212	DAVID	No.  Stick around.
L596071	u3217	m212	STAR	C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
L596055	u3217	m212	STAR	Yeah.
L596054	u3209	m212	DAVID	With him?
L596053	u3217	m212	STAR	For a ride.
L596052	u3209	m212	DAVID	Where you going?
L596501	u3210	m212	EDGAR	The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
L596500	u3216	m212	SAM	What happens in tow and a half hours?
L596499	u3210	m212	EDGAR	We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
L596490	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
L596489	u3216	m212	SAM	No, Nanook!  Quiet!
L596477	u3216	m212	SAM	There's a cop behind us.
L596476	u3210	m212	EDGAR	What?
L596475	u3216	m212	SAM	Oh, no...
L596463	u3210	m212	EDGAR	That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
L596462	u3216	m212	SAM	I thought they'd be in coffins.
L596461	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
L596460	u3216	m212	SAM	What's that smell!?
L596447	u3216	m212	SAM	Chill out Edgar.
L596446	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
L596437	u3210	m212	EDGAR	To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
L596436	u3216	m212	SAM	He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
L596378	u3216	m212	SAM	Hit the lights again.
L596377	u3210	m212	EDGAR	He's not glowing.
L596332	u3216	m212	SAM	How do you know they're not?
L596331	u3210	m212	EDGAR	I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
L596329	u3216	m212	SAM	Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
L596328	u3210	m212	EDGAR	That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
L596327	u3216	m212	SAM	I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
L596271	u3216	m212	SAM	I can't do that!
L596270	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
L596266	u3216	m212	SAM	His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
L596265	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
L596151	u3216	m212	SAM	Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
L596150	u3210	m212	EDGAR	This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
L596147	u3210	m212	EDGAR	You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
L596146	u3216	m212	SAM	Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
L596145	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Or a vampire.
L596003	u3216	m212	SAM	Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
L596002	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
L596001	u3216	m212	SAM	And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
L596533	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Sam, don't --
L596532	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Don't go out there!  Stop him!
L596443	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Okay, okay.
L596442	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
L596440	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'll take you there.
L596439	u3210	m212	EDGAR	I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
L596438	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	David.
L596435	u3210	m212	EDGAR	If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
L596434	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Of course not!
L596342	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
L596341	u3213	m212	LUCY	'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
L596340	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Max?  You men we're having company again?
L596339	u3213	m212	LUCY	I told Max eight o'clock.
L596338	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Smells good.  When do we eat?
L596081	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
L596080	u3213	m212	LUCY	Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
L596079	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Closet monster!?
L596078	u3213	m212	LUCY	I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
L595962	u3213	m212	LUCY	When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
L595961	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Ouch, my hair...
L595960	u3213	m212	LUCY	A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
L595959	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
L596520	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	I better get cleaned up, then.
L596519	u3216	m212	SAM	I guess so.  She said not to be late.
L596518	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Did we have a date tonight?
L596517	u3216	m212	SAM	Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
L596129	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
L596128	u3216	m212	SAM	I thought we were goin' into town.
L596127	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Are we havin' fun or what?
L596124	u3216	m212	SAM	Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
L596123	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
L596122	u3216	m212	SAM	Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
L596121	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Whatcha doin' over here?
L596120	u3216	m212	SAM	Good!
L596119	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
L596118	u3216	m212	SAM	Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
L596084	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Lots more where he came from.
L596083	u3216	m212	SAM	Thanks, Grandpa...
L595976	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
L595975	u3216	m212	SAM	You have a T.V.?
L595974	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	... And stay outta here.
L596191	u3212	m212	LADDIE	You better not like him too much.
L596190	u3217	m212	STAR	I like Michael.
L596189	u3212	m212	LADDIE	You like Michael.
L596188	u3217	m212	STAR	Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
L596187	u3212	m212	LADDIE	No.  Just you.
L596186	u3217	m212	STAR	You didn't tell David?
L596185	u3217	m212	STAR	No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
L596184	u3212	m212	LADDIE	It was a dream, Star.
L596183	u3217	m212	STAR	Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
L596182	u3212	m212	LADDIE	I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
L596181	u3217	m212	STAR	Who, Laddie?
L596180	u3212	m212	LADDIE	I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
L596058	u3217	m212	STAR	This is Michael.
L596057	u3212	m212	LADDIE	Hi... I'm Laddie.
L596592	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Get out, Mom!  Run!
L596591	u3213	m212	LUCY	Michael!...
L596590	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
L596346	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Gotta go, Mom.
L596345	u3213	m212	LUCY	There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
L596344	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Can't.  Got plans of my own.
L596343	u3213	m212	LUCY	Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
L596313	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Mom... please.
L596312	u3213	m212	LUCY	Wait a minute, kiddo.
L596311	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'm tired now.
L596310	u3213	m212	LUCY	-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
L596309	u3213	m212	LUCY	Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
L596308	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We are...
L596307	u3213	m212	LUCY	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
L596306	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Sure.
L596218	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Okay.
L596217	u3213	m212	LUCY	Okay?
L596216	u3213	m212	LUCY	Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
L596215	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
L596214	u3213	m212	LUCY	Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
L596213	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No.  I'm up.
L596212	u3213	m212	LUCY	Michael, are you still in bed?
L596036	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'll pass.
L596035	u3213	m212	LUCY	I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
L596034	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	See you later.
L596021	u3213	m212	LUCY	Oh, no, you won't.
L596020	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'll hitch.
L596019	u3213	m212	LUCY	Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
L596018	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
L595950	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	He's not breathing, Mom.
L595949	u3213	m212	LUCY	He's just a deep sleeper.
L595948	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	He looks dead.
L595939	u3213	m212	LUCY	For everything.
L595938	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	For what.
L595937	u3213	m212	LUCY	Still mad at me?
L596576	u3213	m212	LUCY	What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
L596575	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom!
L596574	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ohmygod...
L596512	u3216	m212	SAM	-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
L596511	u3213	m212	LUCY	There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
L596510	u3216	m212	SAM	No, I'm not...
L596509	u3213	m212	LUCY	Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
L596508	u3216	m212	SAM	But, Mom...
L596507	u3213	m212	LUCY	Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
L596506	u3216	m212	SAM	This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
L596505	u3213	m212	LUCY	Not funny, Sam!
L596504	u3216	m212	SAM	Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
L596503	u3213	m212	LUCY	What did you say?
L596376	u3216	m212	SAM	Must be a circuit breaker.
L596375	u3213	m212	LUCY	Oh, no.  Now what?
L596365	u3216	m212	SAM	C'mere, Nanook.
L596364	u3213	m212	LUCY	Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
L596361	u3213	m212	LUCY	No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
L596360	u3216	m212	SAM	Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
L596359	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
L596358	u3216	m212	SAM	These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
L596297	u3213	m212	LUCY	Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
L596296	u3216	m212	SAM	Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
L596295	u3213	m212	LUCY	In here?
L596294	u3216	m212	SAM	Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
L596291	u3216	m212	SAM	He's already gone to bed.
L596290	u3213	m212	LUCY	Where's Michael?
L596289	u3216	m212	SAM	Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
L596288	u3213	m212	LUCY	Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
L596280	u3216	m212	SAM	We can't talk about it on the phone.
L596279	u3213	m212	LUCY	What's wrong?  Tell me.
L596278	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
L596277	u3213	m212	LUCY	Sam.  Is everything all right?
L596086	u3216	m212	SAM	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
L596085	u3213	m212	LUCY	Lights out, Sam.
L596026	u3216	m212	SAM	Can we get a T.V.?
L596025	u3213	m212	LUCY	I guess no one cares what I got a job.
L596024	u3216	m212	SAM	He met a girl.
L595969	u3213	m212	LUCY	Soon.
L595968	u3216	m212	SAM	Help me, Mom.  Help.
L595947	u3216	m212	SAM	So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
L595946	u3213	m212	LUCY	You've heard this story before?
L595945	u3216	m212	SAM	When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
L595936	u3213	m212	LUCY	Not that poor.
L595935	u3216	m212	SAM	I thought we were poor.
L595934	u3213	m212	LUCY	Tell them to get something to eat.
L595932	u3216	m212	SAM	Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
L595931	u3213	m212	LUCY	That's the boardwalk, Sam.
L595930	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
L595924	u3213	m212	LUCY	Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
L595923	u3216	m212	SAM	Smells like something died.
L595922	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ocean air!
L595921	u3216	m212	SAM	What's that smell?
L595920	u3213	m212	LUCY	We're getting close...
L596588	u3214	m212	MAX	It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
L596587	u3213	m212	LUCY	Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
L596580	u3214	m212	MAX	It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
L596579	u3213	m212	LUCY	Max... what are you talking about?
L596529	u3214	m212	MAX	Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
L596528	u3213	m212	LUCY	I thought you said they needed discipline?
L596527	u3214	m212	MAX	Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
L596526	u3213	m212	LUCY	No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
L596525	u3214	m212	MAX	Something the matter?
L596524	u3213	m212	LUCY	I hope so.
L596523	u3214	m212	MAX	Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
L596390	u3214	m212	MAX	I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
L596389	u3213	m212	LUCY	He doesn't walk all over me.
L596388	u3214	m212	MAX	Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
L596387	u3213	m212	LUCY	I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
L596386	u3214	m212	MAX	Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
L596385	u3213	m212	LUCY	I'm really sorry, Max.
L596369	u3214	m212	MAX	It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
L596368	u3213	m212	LUCY	Max!  What's wrong?
L596363	u3213	m212	LUCY	Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
L596362	u3214	m212	MAX	This looks terrific, Lucy.
L596356	u3214	m212	MAX	Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
L596355	u3213	m212	LUCY	You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
L596354	u3214	m212	MAX	Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
L596247	u3213	m212	LUCY	I hear this is the decade for cute.
L596246	u3214	m212	MAX	Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
L596245	u3213	m212	LUCY	I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
L596244	u3214	m212	MAX	But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
L596243	u3213	m212	LUCY	You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
L596242	u3214	m212	MAX	So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
L596241	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
L596240	u3214	m212	MAX	Not impressed, are you?
L596163	u3214	m212	MAX	I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
L596162	u3213	m212	LUCY	You're cute, Max.
L596159	u3213	m212	LUCY	Hi, Thorn.
L596158	u3214	m212	MAX	Say hello to Thorn.
L595993	u3213	m212	LUCY	Do I look that needy?
L595992	u3214	m212	MAX	-- a job.
L595991	u3213	m212	LUCY	I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
L595990	u3214	m212	MAX	So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
L595989	u3213	m212	LUCY	Lucy.
L595988	u3214	m212	MAX	You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
L596585	u3216	m212	SAM	What?!  Did you know that!?
L596584	u3214	m212	MAX	Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
L596583	u3216	m212	SAM	But you passed the test!
L596384	u3214	m212	MAX	Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
L596383	u3216	m212	SAM	I am?
L596373	u3214	m212	MAX	Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
L596372	u3216	m212	SAM	Does it burn?
L596367	u3214	m212	MAX	Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
L596366	u3216	m212	SAM	How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
L596597	u3217	m212	STAR	So do I!
L596596	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	It's gone.  I feel it!
L596522	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
L596521	u3217	m212	STAR	They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
L596456	u3217	m212	STAR	Save Laddie first.
L596455	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Huh?
L596454	u3217	m212	STAR	Take laddie.
L596453	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	You've got to put this on.
L596421	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
L596420	u3217	m212	STAR	David's looking for me... I have to go.
L596419	u3217	m212	STAR	I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
L596418	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I know, I've felt it...
L596417	u3217	m212	STAR	It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
L596416	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Then it's not too late for us...
L596415	u3217	m212	STAR	Because I love you...
L596414	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Why not?
L596413	u3217	m212	STAR	Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
L596412	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
L596411	u3217	m212	STAR	Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
L596410	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
L596408	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Okay.
L596407	u3217	m212	STAR	I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
L596303	u3217	m212	STAR	Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
L596302	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	When?
L596301	u3217	m212	STAR	Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
L596300	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
L596172	u3217	m212	STAR	No... no, everything's different now...
L596171	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Let's go see them.
L596170	u3217	m212	STAR	No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
L596169	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Now you and David...
L596168	u3217	m212	STAR	I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
L596167	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
L596166	u3217	m212	STAR	Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
L596165	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Ouch.
L596051	u3217	m212	STAR	Okay.
L596050	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
L596049	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
L596048	u3217	m212	STAR	I guess you're new around here.
L596047	u3217	m212	STAR	Michael's great.  I like Michael.
L596046	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'm Michael.
L596045	u3217	m212	STAR	Me, too.
L596044	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
L596043	u3217	m212	STAR	What do you mean?
L596042	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
L596041	u3217	m212	STAR	Star.
L596040	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What's your name?
L596039	u3217	m212	STAR	If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
L596038	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Hi...
L596014	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I just wanted to... I, uh...
L596013	u3217	m212	STAR	Okay.  Talk.
L596012	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Well... yeah.  Sure.
L596011	u3217	m212	STAR	Did you want to talk to me?
L596010	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Well, I...
L596009	u3217	m212	STAR	Are you following me?
L596571	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
L596570	u3216	m212	SAM	What's the matter?
L596481	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Huh?...
L596480	u3216	m212	SAM	Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
L596425	u3216	m212	SAM	The Marines.
L596424	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Who are you calling?
L596423	u3216	m212	SAM	Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
L596422	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Star.
L596406	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I don't know.
L596405	u3216	m212	SAM	It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
L596287	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
L596286	u3216	m212	SAM	I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
L596285	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
L596284	u3216	m212	SAM	What about Mom?
L596283	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
L596258	u3216	m212	SAM	Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
L596257	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What??
L596256	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	He was protecting <u>you</u>!
L596255	u3216	m212	SAM	What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
L596254	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
L596253	u3216	m212	SAM	What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
L596252	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Nanook...
L596251	u3216	m212	SAM	What happened, Michael!?
L596250	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't turn on the light.
L596249	u3216	m212	SAM	Michael?
L596230	u3216	m212	SAM	You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
L596229	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Piss off.
L596228	u3216	m212	SAM	Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
L596227	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't bother.
L596226	u3216	m212	SAM	I'm making you a sandwich.
L596208	u3216	m212	SAM	No.  On the phone.
L596207	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Mom's home?...
L596142	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No.
L596141	u3216	m212	SAM	Wanna go to the comic book store?
L596140	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
L596139	u3216	m212	SAM	The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
L596138	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No.  Why?
L596137	u3216	m212	SAM	Did you spill something?
L596134	u3216	m212	SAM	You're right... not even to mention you and me.
L596133	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What would that make Mom?
L596132	u3216	m212	SAM	You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
L596131	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
L596130	u3216	m212	SAM	What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
L596115	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Entertain yourself.
L596114	u3216	m212	SAM	You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
L596113	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Go away.
L596029	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
L596028	u3216	m212	SAM	Do I have to do this?
L596023	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
L596022	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
L595997	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
L595996	u3216	m212	SAM	Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
L595995	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Nowhere.
L595994	u3216	m212	SAM	Where are we going?
L595979	u3216	m212	SAM	Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
L595978	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	You're beautiful.
L595965	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
L595964	u3216	m212	SAM	I was here first.
L595963	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	This room is mine.
L595958	u3216	m212	SAM	Even poor people have T.V.s
L595957	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
L595956	u3216	m212	SAM	Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
L595955	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Will you give Mom a break?
L595954	u3216	m212	SAM	I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
L595953	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	This is kind of a cool place.
L595942	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
L595941	u3216	m212	SAM	What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
L602040	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
L602039	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Where these tracks headed?
L602036	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I know.
L602035	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Dogs don't eat each other.
L602034	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe dinner.
L602032	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Let's load 'em.
L602031	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
L601888	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
L601887	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
L601842	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Just listen.
L601841	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	What do you want from us?
L601795	u3225	m213	MACREADY	And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
L601794	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Sixteen.
L601957	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
L601956	u3221	m213	CLARK	What the hell you looking at me like that for?
L601955	u3221	m213	CLARK	Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
L601954	u3219	m213	BLAIR	How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
L601952	u3219	m213	BLAIR	You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
L601951	u3221	m213	CLARK	Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
L601950	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
L601949	u3221	m213	CLARK	Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
L601948	u3219	m213	BLAIR	What was he doing in the rec room?
L601947	u3221	m213	CLARK	Yeah.
L601946	u3219	m213	BLAIR	That night?
L601945	u3221	m213	CLARK	No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
L601944	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
L601931	u3219	m213	BLAIR	It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
L601930	u3221	m213	CLARK	"What do you mean ""got"" to the dog?"
L601974	u3224	m213	GARRY	I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
L601973	u3219	m213	BLAIR	You can't let anybody leave!
L601972	u3224	m213	GARRY	Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
L601971	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
L601968	u3224	m213	GARRY	If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
L601967	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
L601960	u3219	m213	BLAIR	No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
L601959	u3224	m213	GARRY	Anybody sick?
L601958	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... It could have gotten to somebody...
L601938	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
L601937	u3224	m213	GARRY	So what's our problem?
L601936	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Look, I know it's hard to believe...
L601896	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Maybe.
L601895	u3224	m213	GARRY	Sure.  You think there's a connection?
L601894	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
L601893	u3224	m213	GARRY	Couldn't make much of it myself.
L601890	u3224	m213	GARRY	I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
L601889	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
L602156	u3226	m213	NAULS	You promise?
L602155	u3219	m213	BLAIR	And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
L602154	u3226	m213	NAULS	Now why'd you go and...
L602153	u3226	m213	NAULS	Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
L602152	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
L602151	u3226	m213	NAULS	What you doin'?
L601927	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
L601926	u3226	m213	NAULS	Finish what?
L601925	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
L602223	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We'll see...
L602222	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
L602221	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Have you come across Fuchs?
L602220	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
L602007	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
L602006	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What?
L602005	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Watch Clark.
L602004	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
L602003	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I don't know who to trust.
L602002	u3225	m213	MACREADY	How you doin', old boy?
L601996	u3219	m213	BLAIR	No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
L601995	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
L601994	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
L601991	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
L601990	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Too damn dangerous.
L602287	u3220	m213	CHILDS	No.  Just let him freeze out there.
L602286	u3228	m213	PALMER	He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
L602285	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
L602284	u3228	m213	PALMER	Let's open it.  Now...
L602279	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Hell no.
L602278	u3228	m213	PALMER	Let's open it.
L602268	u3220	m213	CHILDS	If it did get to him.
L602267	u3228	m213	PALMER	Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
L602249	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
L602248	u3228	m213	PALMER	Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
L602243	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now hold on, you dumb...
L602242	u3228	m213	PALMER	We got to burn 'em.
L602241	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What's it going to do, being a plant?
L602240	u3228	m213	PALMER	Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
L602239	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Let go of me...
L602238	u3228	m213	PALMER	Childs!!
L602237	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now who'd go and do...
L602236	u3228	m213	PALMER	Somebody broke in.
L602230	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
L602229	u3228	m213	PALMER	Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
L602216	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Don't walk behind me.
L602215	u3228	m213	PALMER	What?
L602146	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Ain't it there?
L602145	u3228	m213	PALMER	Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
L601912	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cool it, Palmer!!
L601911	u3228	m213	PALMER	Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
L602198	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You lying bastard...
L602197	u3224	m213	GARRY	Was dark... find a light...
L602196	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I said where?  Where'd you go?!
L602107	u3224	m213	GARRY	Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
L602106	u3220	m213	CHILDS	That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
L602105	u3224	m213	GARRY	I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
L601743	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
L601742	u3224	m213	GARRY	You catch anything he was saying?
L602261	u3226	m213	NAULS	When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
L602260	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut him loose?
L602259	u3226	m213	NAULS	Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
L602171	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
L602170	u3226	m213	NAULS	Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
L602167	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Clark, you come on out here!!
L602166	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's shorted out or something!
L602165	u3220	m213	CHILDS	That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
L602164	u3226	m213	NAULS	I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
L602163	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
L602162	u3220	m213	CHILDS	No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
L602161	u3226	m213	NAULS	Childs!  That a fuse?
L602062	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
L602061	u3226	m213	NAULS	Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
L602441	u3225	m213	MACREADY	If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
L602440	u3220	m213	CHILDS	If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
L602439	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe we shouldn't make it.
L602438	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Then we'll never make it.
L602437	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe we shouldn't.
L602436	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
L602435	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Neither will we.
L602434	u3220	m213	CHILDS	The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
L602433	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Not the only one.
L602429	u3220	m213	CHILDS	"What do you mean ""you think so?"""
L602428	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I think so.
L602374	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
L602373	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Spaceship of some kind.
L602358	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
L602357	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Load of bullshit.
L602345	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
L602344	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We should have jumped his ass.
L602338	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Then kill me.
L602337	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then I'll have to kill you.
L602336	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You ain't tying me up.
L602333	u3225	m213	MACREADY	For your health.
L602332	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What for?
L602331	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
L602314	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We ain't buying that.
L602313	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
L602299	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You been made, MacReady.
L602298	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What clothes?
L602297	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
L602296	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
L602295	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you doing?
L602283	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
L602282	u3220	m213	CHILDS	... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
L602212	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
L602211	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Well, who says I want you going with me?!
L602181	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Gee, thanks!
L602180	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
L602179	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Garry's missing!
L602178	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What?
L602177	u3220	m213	CHILDS	MacReady!
L602126	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We got morphine, don't we.
L602125	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What do we do about those three?
L602054	u3225	m213	MACREADY	He's gone already!  Do it!
L602053	u3220	m213	CHILDS	But...
L602052	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Torch them!!
L602051	u3225	m213	MACREADY	How the fuck do I know?!
L602050	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What we going to do?!
L602038	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Probably the next meal.
L602037	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Where's the other half?
L602030	u3225	m213	MACREADY	That's good enough.
L602029	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
L601921	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You buy any of this, Blair?
L601920	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
L601919	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
L601918	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
L601910	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
L601909	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
L601907	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Well, go on.
L601906	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Look, I'm just guessing...
L601905	u3220	m213	CHILDS	MacReady!
L601879	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
L601878	u3220	m213	CHILDS	The dogs?
L601877	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Torch it over there!
L601875	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
L601874	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What's happening?
L602354	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
L602353	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Thank you.
L602352	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I guess you're okay.
L602324	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Damn you, MacReady!
L602323	u3225	m213	MACREADY	And if anyone tries to wake me...
L602321	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Enough, MacReady!
L602320	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
L602319	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Now hold him.
L602097	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I think so.
L602096	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Would that test have worked?
L602094	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I guess I'm the only one.
L602093	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Well, who's got access to it?
L601817	u3225	m213	MACREADY	It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
L601816	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
L601815	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you doing?
L601814	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	All in Norwegian.
L601813	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Anything?
L601807	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
L601806	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Hey, Sweden!!!
L601805	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Come on, Copper.
L601804	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	My God, what in hell happened here?
L601789	u3225	m213	MACREADY	So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
L601788	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
L602084	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, get to it.
L602083	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A couple of hours.
L602082	u3224	m213	GARRY	How long will it take you to prepare this?
L602064	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
L602063	u3224	m213	GARRY	Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
L601844	u3224	m213	GARRY	Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
L601843	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
L601767	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Bennings?
L601766	u3224	m213	GARRY	In this weather?
L601765	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
L601764	u3224	m213	GARRY	Nothing we can do about that.
L601763	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
L602228	u3227	m213	NORRIS	After all this mess.
L602227	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	After all this mess then.
L602226	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
L602225	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
L602104	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A day or so ago... I guess.
L602103	u3227	m213	NORRIS	When was the last time you used it?
L602102	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
L602076	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A serum test possibly.
L602075	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
L602078	u3224	m213	GARRY	What's that?
L602077	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Right.  Why not?
L601761	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
L601760	u3224	m213	GARRY	How many in their party?
L601741	u3224	m213	GARRY	That far?
L601740	u3223	m213	FUCHS	'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
L601739	u3224	m213	GARRY	How far's that?
L601738	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
L602115	u3224	m213	GARRY	I'll put this right through your head.
L602114	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	No.
L602113	u3224	m213	GARRY	Put that down!
L601963	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
L601962	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
L601826	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, stick to it.
L601825	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
L601824	u3224	m213	GARRY	You reach anybody yet?
L601823	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Hey, man...!
L602413	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Little over two hours.
L602412	u3224	m213	GARRY	How long's it been?
L602393	u3224	m213	GARRY	One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
L602392	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Looks good.
L602363	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
L602362	u3224	m213	GARRY	Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
L602335	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Damn if I won't.
L602334	u3224	m213	GARRY	Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
L602101	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Could anyone have gotten it from you?
L602100	u3224	m213	GARRY	Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
L602024	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
L602023	u3224	m213	GARRY	You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
L602022	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
L602019	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I am going after them.
L602018	u3224	m213	GARRY	You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
L601882	u3224	m213	GARRY	Extinguishers.
L601881	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Don't let up, Childs!
L601880	u3224	m213	GARRY	We're on fire!
L601791	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
L601790	u3224	m213	GARRY	Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
L602343	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
L602342	u3228	m213	PALMER	He's dead.
L602341	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Tie up Clark, too.
L602330	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm sure a lot of you already know.
L602329	u3228	m213	PALMER	What kind of test?
L602207	u3228	m213	PALMER	I ain't going with Sanchez.
L602206	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
L602189	u3228	m213	PALMER	Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
L602188	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We going to make it?
L602187	u3228	m213	PALMER	Somebody definitely messed with it.
L602186	u3228	m213	PALMER	Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
L602185	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
L602148	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Move it, Palmer.
L602147	u3228	m213	PALMER	No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
L602087	u3228	m213	PALMER	And that was enough?
L602086	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
L602085	u3228	m213	PALMER	How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
L602026	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
L602025	u3228	m213	PALMER	Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
L601984	u3228	m213	PALMER	Blair.  He's gone berserk.
L601983	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What's...
L601793	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
L601792	u3228	m213	PALMER	Four!
L602387	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
L602386	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	He might just wait us out.
L602382	u3225	m213	MACREADY	It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
L602381	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	What if it doesn't come?
L602205	u3225	m213	MACREADY	If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
L602204	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Why?
L602203	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
L602191	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
L602190	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Where were the flashlights?
L602132	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Can you think of any other tests?
L602131	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
L602416	u3226	m213	NAULS	Bet the last place you ever go.
L602415	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then we go after him.
L602414	u3226	m213	NAULS	Maybe it ain't coming.
L602409	u3226	m213	NAULS	Position, my ass...
L602408	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Calm down and get in your position.
L602407	u3226	m213	NAULS	Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
L602406	u3226	m213	NAULS	Screw the generator!!
L602405	u3225	m213	MACREADY	The generator!
L602404	u3226	m213	NAULS	Get back!!
L602385	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
L602384	u3226	m213	NAULS	You crazy?  He might be inside already?
L602383	u3225	m213	MACREADY	You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
L602379	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Forget about Childs.  He's over.
L602378	u3226	m213	NAULS	What about Childs?
L602376	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Anyplace but here.
L602375	u3226	m213	NAULS	Where was he trying to go?
L602372	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Everything that's been missing.
L602371	u3226	m213	NAULS	What is it?
L602348	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
L602347	u3226	m213	NAULS	What are you going to do?  Drink it?
L602346	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
L602277	u3226	m213	NAULS	Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
L602276	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
L602233	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
L602232	u3226	m213	NAULS	This storm do that?
L602141	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Just keep looking.
L602140	u3226	m213	NAULS	That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
L602176	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Well, let's get down there.
L602175	u3227	m213	NORRIS	It's the generator I think!  No power.
L602174	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Yeah!
L602173	u3227	m213	NORRIS	MacReady, that you?
L602172	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What's happened?!
L602130	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
L602129	u3227	m213	NORRIS	We should sleep in shifts.
L602099	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Who else could have used that key?
L602098	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
L601902	u3225	m213	MACREADY	No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
L601901	u3227	m213	NORRIS	You know damn well what we both make of it.
L601900	u3225	m213	MACREADY	So what do you make of it?
L601899	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
L601785	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What for?
L601784	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Get your gear on.
L601783	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
L601782	u3227	m213	NORRIS	You jerking off or just pissed?
L602399	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Can't hear you.
L602398	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
L602397	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	What?!
L602396	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
L602395	u3226	m213	NAULS	Hear what?
L602394	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	You hear that?
L602266	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	When do you think it got to him?
L602265	u3226	m213	NAULS	He's one of them.
L602264	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	MacReady...?
L602263	u3226	m213	NAULS	... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
L625216	u3344	m222	BURT	My cannon.
L625215	u3345	m222	EARL	What do <u>you</u> use it for?
L625214	u3344	m222	BURT	Cannon fuse.
L625213	u3345	m222	EARL	What the hell is that, anyway?
L625212	u3345	m222	EARL	I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
L625211	u3344	m222	BURT	How much you think?
L625201	u3344	m222	BURT	You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
L625200	u3345	m222	EARL	You can't fight'em that way...
L625199	u3344	m222	BURT	What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
L625113	u3344	m222	BURT	Roger that.
L625112	u3345	m222	EARL	That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
L625111	u3344	m222	BURT	Yeah, still got one poking around.
L625065	u3345	m222	EARL	Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
L625064	u3344	m222	BURT	Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
L625063	u3345	m222	EARL	Yeah, like they got a plan...
L625053	u3345	m222	EARL	Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
L625052	u3344	m222	BURT	No problem.
L625051	u3345	m222	EARL	Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
L624844	u3345	m222	EARL	One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
L624843	u3344	m222	BURT	You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
L624838	u3344	m222	BURT	Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
L624837	u3345	m222	EARL	Ready as we'll ever be.
L624836	u3344	m222	BURT	You guys all set?
L624782	u3344	m222	BURT	Some kind of mutation...?
L624781	u3345	m222	EARL	Or a big mother slug maybe?
L624662	u3344	m222	BURT	"Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  ""Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."""
L624661	u3345	m222	EARL	Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
L625148	u3347	m222	HEATHER	I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
L625147	u3344	m222	BURT	What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
L625072	u3344	m222	BURT	I think I scared it!
L625071	u3347	m222	HEATHER	Knock it off, Burt!
L625050	u3344	m222	BURT	Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
L625049	u3347	m222	HEATHER	You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
L625022	u3344	m222	BURT	Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
L625021	u3347	m222	HEATHER	I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
L624803	u3347	m222	HEATHER	Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
L624802	u3344	m222	BURT	Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
L625203	u3344	m222	BURT	Well, who put you two in charge?
L625202	u3353	m222	VAL	BACK OFF, BURT...!
L625184	u3353	m222	VAL	Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
L625183	u3344	m222	BURT	She's got my vote.
L625146	u3344	m222	BURT	Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
L625145	u3353	m222	VAL	Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
L625143	u3353	m222	VAL	Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
L625142	u3344	m222	BURT	That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
L625140	u3344	m222	BURT	In a minute.
L625139	u3353	m222	VAL	Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
L625038	u3353	m222	VAL	Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
L625037	u3344	m222	BURT	What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
L625036	u3353	m222	VAL	Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
L625035	u3344	m222	BURT	Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
L625034	u3353	m222	VAL	Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
L625032	u3344	m222	BURT	Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
L625031	u3353	m222	VAL	Burt, can you hear me now?
L625030	u3344	m222	BURT	Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
L624773	u3353	m222	VAL	You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
L624772	u3344	m222	BURT	What the hell you doing back already?
L624670	u3353	m222	VAL	We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
L624669	u3344	m222	BURT	A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
L625254	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
L625253	u3345	m222	EARL	You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
L625252	u3352	m222	RHONDA	You're really leaving, huh?
L625251	u3345	m222	EARL	Howdy, Rhonda.
L625250	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
L625222	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Nope, there!  That's one.
L625221	u3345	m222	EARL	Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
L625193	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Could we make it to the mountains?
L625192	u3345	m222	EARL	So...now what?
L625163	u3345	m222	EARL	No.  We go straight.
L625162	u3352	m222	RHONDA	We're not going over there, right?
L625128	u3352	m222	RHONDA	VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
L625127	u3345	m222	EARL	He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
L625007	u3345	m222	EARL	Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
L625006	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Oh my God.
L625001	u3345	m222	EARL	No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
L625000	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Well, we can take my truck then.
L624971	u3352	m222	RHONDA	The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
L624970	u3345	m222	EARL	You know, up the jeep trail.
L624942	u3345	m222	EARL	You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
L624941	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
L624940	u3345	m222	EARL	I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
L624924	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Well, I was wondering if we could...
L624923	u3345	m222	EARL	We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
L624922	u3352	m222	RHONDA	I might have an idea...
L624899	u3345	m222	EARL	I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
L624898	u3352	m222	RHONDA	There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
L624893	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
L624892	u3345	m222	EARL	Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
L624874	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
L624873	u3345	m222	EARL	I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
L624872	u3352	m222	RHONDA	I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
L624871	u3345	m222	EARL	Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
L624644	u3345	m222	EARL	No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
L624643	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
L624642	u3345	m222	EARL	Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
L625269	u3345	m222	EARL	Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
L625268	u3353	m222	VAL	You are so full of shit...
L625267	u3345	m222	EARL	She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
L625266	u3353	m222	VAL	What?
L625265	u3345	m222	EARL	Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
L625261	u3345	m222	EARL	She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
L625260	u3353	m222	VAL	Somebody paying you to do this?
L625259	u3345	m222	EARL	You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
L625258	u3353	m222	VAL	Civil?  I'm civil.
L625257	u3345	m222	EARL	Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
L625249	u3353	m222	VAL	No ties.
L625248	u3345	m222	EARL	Yeah...but no ties.
L625247	u3353	m222	VAL	Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
L625246	u3345	m222	EARL	<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
L625245	u3353	m222	VAL	Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
L625244	u3345	m222	EARL	Road's in!
L625240	u3353	m222	VAL	Not yet, not yet...
L625239	u3345	m222	EARL	Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
L625236	u3353	m222	VAL	I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
L625235	u3345	m222	EARL	What the hell are you doing?!!
L625232	u3345	m222	EARL	I want to live for the three days.
L625231	u3353	m222	VAL	So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
L625230	u3345	m222	EARL	Use the fucking bomb!
L625229	u3353	m222	VAL	It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
L625228	u3345	m222	EARL	Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
L625227	u3353	m222	VAL	They're...they're trying to make us move!
L625218	u3345	m222	EARL	Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
L625217	u3353	m222	VAL	Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
L625196	u3353	m222	VAL	Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
L625195	u3345	m222	EARL	Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
L625175	u3345	m222	EARL	Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
L625174	u3353	m222	VAL	Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
L625165	u3345	m222	EARL	I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
L625164	u3353	m222	VAL	Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
L625125	u3345	m222	EARL	Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
L625124	u3353	m222	VAL	Watch your ass, shithead.
L625118	u3353	m222	VAL	Only if something happens to me.
L625117	u3345	m222	EARL	<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
L625116	u3353	m222	VAL	Get real.  I'm faster than you.
L625115	u3345	m222	EARL	Like hell you are.
L625114	u3353	m222	VAL	<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
L625098	u3345	m222	EARL	We got a plan!
L625097	u3353	m222	VAL	Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
L625096	u3345	m222	EARL	Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
L625095	u3353	m222	VAL	Its tires are flat...
L625094	u3345	m222	EARL	A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
L625093	u3353	m222	VAL	But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
L625091	u3345	m222	EARL	Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
L625090	u3353	m222	VAL	Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
L625089	u3345	m222	EARL	Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
L625026	u3353	m222	VAL	We need another plan.
L625025	u3345	m222	EARL	Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
L625024	u3353	m222	VAL	How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
L625004	u3353	m222	VAL	Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
L625003	u3345	m222	EARL	Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
L624977	u3353	m222	VAL	I'm gonna help you.
L624976	u3345	m222	EARL	I'm gonna kick his ass!
L624961	u3353	m222	VAL	Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
L624960	u3345	m222	EARL	You're right, don't matter where they come from.
L624939	u3353	m222	VAL	Right.
L624938	u3345	m222	EARL	You go north, I'll go south.
L624927	u3353	m222	VAL	Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
L624926	u3345	m222	EARL	Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
L624921	u3353	m222	VAL	Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
L624920	u3345	m222	EARL	Don't he have a home to go to?
L624919	u3353	m222	VAL	First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
L624918	u3345	m222	EARL	Well, folks, what's the plan?
L624911	u3353	m222	VAL	Me, too.
L624910	u3345	m222	EARL	You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
L624908	u3353	m222	VAL	It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
L624907	u3345	m222	EARL	Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
L624906	u3353	m222	VAL	Son of a bitch!
L624903	u3345	m222	EARL	Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
L624902	u3353	m222	VAL	Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
L624901	u3345	m222	EARL	Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
L624897	u3345	m222	EARL	I think we wait right here.
L624896	u3353	m222	VAL	I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
L624895	u3345	m222	EARL	Okay, now, how far's your truck?
L624894	u3353	m222	VAL	God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
L624891	u3353	m222	VAL	Little sons of bitches.
L624890	u3345	m222	EARL	Prairie dog burrow...
L624888	u3345	m222	EARL	Yeah.  Where's your truck?
L624887	u3353	m222	VAL	We'll take your word for it.
L624883	u3353	m222	VAL	Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
L624882	u3345	m222	EARL	Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
L624881	u3353	m222	VAL	You got <u>that</u> right!
L624880	u3345	m222	EARL	Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
L624879	u3353	m222	VAL	Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
L624878	u3345	m222	EARL	Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
L624877	u3353	m222	VAL	So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
L624876	u3345	m222	EARL	This is one big mother!
L624864	u3353	m222	VAL	Sons of bitches!
L624863	u3345	m222	EARL	What the hell are they?
L624860	u3353	m222	VAL	Oh shit!
L624859	u3345	m222	EARL	Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
L624857	u3345	m222	EARL	<u>Why</u> would they do it?
L624856	u3353	m222	VAL	That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
L624855	u3345	m222	EARL	Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
L624854	u3353	m222	VAL	Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
L624853	u3345	m222	EARL	Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
L624850	u3353	m222	VAL	Great.  Thank you.
L624849	u3345	m222	EARL	That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
L624835	u3353	m222	VAL	The rifle.
L624834	u3345	m222	EARL	You want the rifle or the Smith?
L624833	u3353	m222	VAL	Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
L624832	u3345	m222	EARL	Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
L624831	u3353	m222	VAL	Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
L624797	u3345	m222	EARL	A man who plans ahead.
L624796	u3353	m222	VAL	Fifteen lousy bucks.
L624795	u3345	m222	EARL	Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
L624786	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
L624785	u3345	m222	EARL	It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
L624771	u3345	m222	EARL	Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
L624770	u3353	m222	VAL	Fuck you!
L624768	u3353	m222	VAL	I am not!
L624767	u3345	m222	EARL	You're hung up again.
L624766	u3353	m222	VAL	Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
L624765	u3345	m222	EARL	Val!  Val!
L624764	u3353	m222	VAL	Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
L624761	u3345	m222	EARL	Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
L624760	u3353	m222	VAL	Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
L624743	u3353	m222	VAL	What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
L624742	u3345	m222	EARL	Oh, Jesus!!
L624737	u3353	m222	VAL	I'll go with that plan.
L624736	u3345	m222	EARL	Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
L624735	u3353	m222	VAL	Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
L624734	u3345	m222	EARL	You got that right.
L624733	u3353	m222	VAL	Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
L624732	u3345	m222	EARL	Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
L624731	u3353	m222	VAL	Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
L624730	u3345	m222	EARL	Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
L624729	u3353	m222	VAL	If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
L624728	u3345	m222	EARL	Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
L624716	u3353	m222	VAL	He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
L624715	u3345	m222	EARL	You're full of shit.
L624714	u3353	m222	VAL	Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
L624713	u3345	m222	EARL	One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
L624712	u3353	m222	VAL	Jeez, look at that guy.
L624708	u3345	m222	EARL	Adios, bridge!
L624707	u3353	m222	VAL	So long, cactus!
L624705	u3353	m222	VAL	Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
L624704	u3345	m222	EARL	We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
L624696	u3353	m222	VAL	That's the plan.
L624695	u3345	m222	EARL	She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
L624694	u3353	m222	VAL	Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
L624693	u3345	m222	EARL	Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
L624692	u3353	m222	VAL	I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
L624691	u3345	m222	EARL	"In the past year I must've said a hundred times ""We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves.""  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?"
L624690	u3353	m222	VAL	What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
L624689	u3345	m222	EARL	Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
L624688	u3353	m222	VAL	Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
L624684	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
L624683	u3345	m222	EARL	Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
L624682	u3353	m222	VAL	So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
L624681	u3345	m222	EARL	We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
L624680	u3353	m222	VAL	So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
L624676	u3345	m222	EARL	You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
L624675	u3353	m222	VAL	Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
L624668	u3353	m222	VAL	Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
L624667	u3345	m222	EARL	Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
L624655	u3345	m222	EARL	I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
L624654	u3353	m222	VAL	Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
L624653	u3345	m222	EARL	Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
L624652	u3353	m222	VAL	Tammy Lynn Baxter.
L624651	u3345	m222	EARL	...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
L624650	u3353	m222	VAL	Well, sure.
L624649	u3345	m222	EARL	Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
L624648	u3353	m222	VAL	Why?
L624647	u3345	m222	EARL	Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
L624646	u3353	m222	VAL	What the hell do we know about seismographs?
L624645	u3345	m222	EARL	You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
L624632	u3353	m222	VAL	The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
L624631	u3345	m222	EARL	Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
L624630	u3353	m222	VAL	Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
L624629	u3345	m222	EARL	Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
L624628	u3353	m222	VAL	Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
L624627	u3345	m222	EARL	Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
L624625	u3353	m222	VAL	Do not talk to the driver.
L624624	u3345	m222	EARL	You're gonna get us hung up.
L624623	u3345	m222	EARL	Has a lot of rain.
L624622	u3353	m222	VAL	Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
L624620	u3345	m222	EARL	Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
L624619	u3353	m222	VAL	Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
L624618	u3345	m222	EARL	I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
L624617	u3353	m222	VAL	If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
L624616	u3345	m222	EARL	I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
L624615	u3353	m222	VAL	How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
L624614	u3353	m222	VAL	Hell you did.  Your turn.
L624613	u3345	m222	EARL	No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
L624612	u3353	m222	VAL	Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
L624611	u3345	m222	EARL	You didn't cook breakfast?
L624606	u3346	m222	EDGAR	You bet.
L624605	u3350	m222	OLD FRED	I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
L624604	u3346	m222	EDGAR	I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
L624603	u3350	m222	OLD FRED	We playing cards tonight?
L624602	u3346	m222	EDGAR	If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
L624601	u3350	m222	OLD FRED	Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
L624600	u3346	m222	EDGAR	Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
L624599	u3350	m222	OLD FRED	Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
L624598	u3346	m222	EDGAR	She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
L624597	u3350	m222	OLD FRED	How's she doing?
L625078	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah, Heather, we got you.
L625077	u3347	m222	HEATHER	Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
L625075	u3353	m222	VAL	They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
L625074	u3347	m222	HEATHER	We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
L625070	u3353	m222	VAL	We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
L625069	u3347	m222	HEATHER	Yeah, Val.
L625068	u3353	m222	VAL	Burt!  Heather!
L624664	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
L624663	u3347	m222	HEATHER	Down, honey, down.
L624660	u3353	m222	VAL	Ran into the new college student, Rona.
L624659	u3347	m222	HEATHER	Hi, guys, what you been up to?
L624827	u3348	m222	JIM	God, what a stink!
L624826	u3349	m222	MEGAN	Come on.  Get away from it!
L624823	u3348	m222	JIM	Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
L624822	u3349	m222	MEGAN	You sure this is where it was?
L624821	u3348	m222	JIM	It's...gone...!
L624820	u3349	m222	MEGAN	Well, what's wrong with it?
L624818	u3348	m222	JIM	Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
L624817	u3349	m222	MEGAN	That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
L624816	u3348	m222	JIM	What?
L624815	u3349	m222	MEGAN	Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
L624814	u3348	m222	JIM	The con...!  Oh my God.
L624813	u3349	m222	MEGAN	We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
L624812	u3348	m222	JIM	I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
L624999	u3353	m222	VAL	Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
L624998	u3351	m222	PHAM VAN	I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
L624790	u3351	m222	PHAM VAN	Okay, ten dollars.
L624789	u3353	m222	VAL	Twenty.
L624757	u3351	m222	PHAM VAN	I didn't do it!  What's going on?
L624756	u3353	m222	VAL	I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
L624672	u3353	m222	VAL	You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
L624671	u3351	m222	PHAM VAN	And I appreciate it.
L624666	u3353	m222	VAL	Could be.
L624665	u3351	m222	PHAM VAN	Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
L625188	u3353	m222	VAL	LET'S DO IT!
L625187	u3352	m222	RHONDA	It worked!  There they go!
L625107	u3353	m222	VAL	Good point.
L625106	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
L625105	u3353	m222	VAL	I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
L625100	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
L625099	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
L625086	u3353	m222	VAL	Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
L625085	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
L625083	u3352	m222	RHONDA	You guys do all the odd jobs.
L625082	u3353	m222	VAL	What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
L625062	u3353	m222	VAL	They're working together, too.
L625061	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
L625056	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Why do you all keep asking me?
L625055	u3353	m222	VAL	What's it doing?
L624993	u3352	m222	RHONDA	It does.
L624992	u3353	m222	VAL	You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
L624969	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
L624968	u3353	m222	VAL	Rhonda's got an idea about that.
L624934	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah.  One, two, three...
L624933	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Ready?
L624931	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Let's assume that it is.
L624930	u3353	m222	VAL	Think it's still following us?
L624915	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
L624914	u3353	m222	VAL	You okay?
L624913	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Darn it!
L624641	u3352	m222	RHONDA	"Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as ""weird vibes.""  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this."
L624640	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
L624639	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
L624638	u3353	m222	VAL	Around here?  Why would they?
L624637	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
L624635	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
L624634	u3353	m222	VAL	Yeah, geography.
L624633	u3352	m222	RHONDA	Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
L630743	u3378	m224	COOPER	She is preparing a great abundance of food.
L630742	u3371	m224	ALBERT	You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
L630741	u3378	m224	COOPER	She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
L630740	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Tell me some other things about her.
L630739	u3378	m224	COOPER	Blonde.
L630738	u3371	m224	ALBERT	What color hair will she have?
L630737	u3378	m224	COOPER	A woman.
L630736	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
L630735	u3378	m224	COOPER	Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
L630734	u3371	m224	ALBERT	"You said, ""Teresa Banks"", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?"
L630733	u3378	m224	COOPER	Albert.
L630732	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
L630731	u3378	m224	COOPER	The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
L630730	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
L631132	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I want you to kill for me.
L631131	u3390	m224	LAURA	No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
L631130	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I want you to kill for me.
L631129	u3390	m224	LAURA	No.
L631039	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
L631038	u3390	m224	LAURA	Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
L631037	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
L630942	u3390	m224	LAURA	NO! GOD, NO...
L630941	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
L630857	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I want you.
L630856	u3390	m224	LAURA	Go away. I am not talking to you.
L630855	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
L630854	u3390	m224	LAURA	No... No, go away.
L631179	u3390	m224	LAURA	Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
L631178	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Bobby's got it.
L631175	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bobby...
L631174	u3373	m224	BOBBY	We can do it right here.
L631172	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
L631171	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
L631170	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Let's ditch this place and party.
L631169	u3390	m224	LAURA	Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
L631168	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
L631167	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
L631166	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Don't get funny with me again.
L631165	u3390	m224	LAURA	What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
L631164	u3373	m224	BOBBY	No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
L631163	u3390	m224	LAURA	Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
L631162	u3373	m224	BOBBY	The stuff we got last night.
L631161	u3390	m224	LAURA	What was?
L631160	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
L631134	u3390	m224	LAURA	You killed Mike.
L631133	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
L631127	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
L631126	u3373	m224	BOBBY	This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
L631116	u3390	m224	LAURA	Here he comes.
L631115	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Here he comes.
L631045	u3390	m224	LAURA	Don't be late.
L631044	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
L631043	u3390	m224	LAURA	Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
L631042	u3373	m224	BOBBY	It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
L631041	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm nearly out.
L630650	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
L630649	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
L630648	u3390	m224	LAURA	Get lost Bobby.
L630647	u3373	m224	BOBBY	I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
L630646	u3390	m224	LAURA	I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
L630645	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
L630487	u3374	m224	CABLE	My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
L630486	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
L630485	u3374	m224	CABLE	We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
L630484	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
L630483	u3374	m224	CABLE	Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
L630482	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
L630481	u3374	m224	CABLE	What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
L630354	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
L630353	u3374	m224	CABLE	It's 4:30. We close at five.
L630352	u3374	m224	CABLE	Out back in our morgue.
L630351	u3379	m224	DESMOND	That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
L630350	u3374	m224	CABLE	A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
L630349	u3379	m224	DESMOND	"Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be ""Federal"". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased."
L630348	u3374	m224	CABLE	You're lucky I am not wasting you.
L630347	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
L630346	u3374	m224	CABLE	"Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a ""J. Edgar"" coming up I think I said, ""So what?"""
L630345	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
L630541	u3375	m224	CARL	Yep, it sure is.
L630540	u3378	m224	COOPER	Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
L630539	u3375	m224	CARL	Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
L630538	u3378	m224	COOPER	Can you tell me what their names were?
L630537	u3375	m224	CARL	An old woman and her grandson.
L630536	u3378	m224	COOPER	Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
L630535	u3375	m224	CARL	A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
L630534	u3378	m224	COOPER	What was here, Mr. Rodd?
L630533	u3375	m224	CARL	God damn, you people are confusing.
L630532	u3378	m224	COOPER	I am going over here.
L630531	u3375	m224	CARL	Well, where are you going?
L630530	u3378	m224	COOPER	I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
L630529	u3375	m224	CARL	That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
L630528	u3378	m224	COOPER	Thank you, Carl.
L630527	u3375	m224	CARL	GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
L630477	u3375	m224	CARL	That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
L630476	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
L630475	u3375	m224	CARL	Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
L630474	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Is there a golf course around here?
L630460	u3375	m224	CARL	That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
L630459	u3379	m224	DESMOND	You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
L630447	u3375	m224	CARL	"No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff ""Not-Quite- Able""... Here's the trailer now."
L630446	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
L630445	u3375	m224	CARL	Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
L630444	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Was there an argument?
L630443	u3375	m224	CARL	Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
L630442	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did she have someone with her?
L630441	u3375	m224	CARL	Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
L630440	u3375	m224	CARL	More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
L630439	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
L630493	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I think I'll take off my badge as well.
L630492	u3376	m224	CLIFF	You try that you little monkey.
L630473	u3379	m224	DESMOND	No you couldn't.
L630472	u3376	m224	CLIFF	Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
L630471	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did you know Teresa Banks?
L630468	u3376	m224	CLIFF	You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
L630467	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
L630466	u3376	m224	CLIFF	Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
L630465	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
L630339	u3376	m224	CLIFF	Oh.
L630338	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
L630303	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
L630302	u3377	m224	COLE	GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
L630299	u3377	m224	COLE	YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
L630298	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Congratulations. I heard about that.
L630294	u3377	m224	COLE	I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
L630293	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Smell something fishy, huh?
L630292	u3377	m224	COLE	GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
L630291	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Okay, Gordon!!!
L630290	u3377	m224	COLE	OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
L630289	u3379	m224	DESMOND	OK, Gordon.
L630288	u3377	m224	COLE	NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
L630287	u3379	m224	DESMOND	OK, Gordon.
L630286	u3377	m224	COLE	CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
L630285	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Yes...
L630603	u3377	m224	COLE	ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
L630602	u3378	m224	COOPER	It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
L630599	u3377	m224	COLE	ALBERT?
L630598	u3378	m224	COOPER	Teresa Banks.
L630597	u3377	m224	COLE	QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
L630593	u3377	m224	COLE	ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
L630592	u3378	m224	COOPER	What?
L630591	u3377	m224	COLE	HE'S GONE.
L630553	u3377	m224	COLE	COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
L630552	u3378	m224	COOPER	Phillip?
L630511	u3377	m224	COLE	COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
L630510	u3378	m224	COOPER	What is it, Gordon?
L630525	u3398	m224	STANLEY	No, sir, we did not.
L630524	u3378	m224	COOPER	And no one found the ring?
L630523	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
L630522	u3378	m224	COOPER	Tell me about the letter.
L630521	u3398	m224	STANLEY	No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
L630520	u3378	m224	COOPER	Stanley, I heard all about it.
L630519	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
L630518	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
L630517	u3378	m224	COOPER	And neither will I.
L630516	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
L630515	u3378	m224	COOPER	I'm up to speed, Stanley.
L630514	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
L630513	u3378	m224	COOPER	Anything else?
L630512	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
L631251	u3393	m224	MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE	You are here and there is no place to go...
L631250	u3378	m224	COOPER	Where am I? And how can I leave?
L631249	u3393	m224	MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE	The later events have never been kept a secret.
L631248	u3378	m224	COOPER	That would indicate that it's the future.
L631247	u3393	m224	MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE	Someone else has it now.
L631246	u3378	m224	COOPER	Where is the ring?
L630392	u3384	m224	JACK	No.  Ask Irene over there.
L630391	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did she ever mention any friends?
L630390	u3384	m224	JACK	No.
L630389	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Ever see her with someone else?
L630388	u3384	m224	JACK	No.
L630387	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Any friends?
L630386	u3384	m224	JACK	Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
L630385	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
L630384	u3384	m224	JACK	He didn't suffer.
L630383	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sorry to hear it.
L630382	u3384	m224	JACK	He's dead -- good and dead.
L630381	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Where's Hap?
L630380	u3384	m224	JACK	Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
L630426	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks.
L630425	u3383	m224	IRENE	Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
L630424	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What do you mean?
L630423	u3383	m224	IRENE	You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
L630411	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks.
L630410	u3383	m224	IRENE	"I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a ""freak accident""."
L630409	u3379	m224	DESMOND	He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
L630406	u3383	m224	IRENE	No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
L630405	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Do you take cocaine, Irene?
L630404	u3383	m224	IRENE	No.
L630403	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
L630402	u3383	m224	IRENE	There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
L630401	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What happened to her?
L630400	u3383	m224	IRENE	Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
L630399	u3383	m224	IRENE	She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
L630398	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
L630397	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Say no more.
L630396	u3383	m224	IRENE	Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
L630395	u3379	m224	DESMOND	How come Jack let's you work here?
L630394	u3383	m224	IRENE	Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
L630501	u3398	m224	STANLEY	We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
L630500	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
L630499	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
L630498	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Faulty wiring.
L630497	u3398	m224	STANLEY	One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
L630490	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
L630489	u3398	m224	STANLEY	"When he says, ""Discussion"", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?"
L630480	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Yes, he is like a clown.
L630479	u3379	m224	DESMOND	He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
L630478	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
L630457	u3398	m224	STANLEY	May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
L630456	u3379	m224	DESMOND	My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
L630455	u3398	m224	STANLEY	She's wearing a ring.
L630454	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Take a look at this.
L630452	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I'll get my kit.
L630451	u3379	m224	DESMOND	You better dust this place, Sam.
L630450	u3379	m224	DESMOND	She must have known someone.
L630449	u3398	m224	STANLEY	She lived alone.
L630432	u3398	m224	STANLEY	In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
L630431	u3379	m224	DESMOND	No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
L630430	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Are you speaking to me in a code?
L630429	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
L630428	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I think that's a good idea.
L630427	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
L630422	u3398	m224	STANLEY	It's not late, it's early. Really early.
L630421	u3379	m224	DESMOND	It's late, Sam.
L630420	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Desmond, it's...
L630378	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
L630377	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
L630376	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
L630375	u3398	m224	STANLEY	"It is a piece of paper with the letter ""T"" imprinted on it. Take a look."
L630374	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What is it?
L630373	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
L630372	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Accidental?
L630370	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Oh.
L630369	u3398	m224	STANLEY	There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
L630366	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Cole said she was 17.
L630365	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
L630364	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
L630363	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Maybe, later we could take a look.
L630362	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I don't know, Sam.
L630361	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
L630360	u3379	m224	DESMOND	That's good.
L630359	u3398	m224	STANLEY	No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
L630358	u3379	m224	DESMOND	That's what I heard.
L630357	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
L630334	u3398	m224	STANLEY	It must be a high priority situation.
L630333	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
L630332	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I see. He does talk loud.
L630331	u3379	m224	DESMOND	He talks loud. And he loves his code.
L630330	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
L630329	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
L630328	u3398	m224	STANLEY	What did Gordon's tie mean?
L630327	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
L630326	u3398	m224	STANLEY	A blue rose.
L630325	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
L630324	u3398	m224	STANLEY	The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
L630323	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
L630322	u3398	m224	STANLEY	So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
L630321	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
L630320	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Oh, the uncle is missing.
L630314	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
L630313	u3398	m224	STANLEY	What do you mean?
L630312	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Lil was wearing a sour face.
L630311	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
L630310	u3398	m224	STANLEY	How do you figure?
L630309	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We're heading into a difficult situation.
L630308	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Shorthand. Really?
L630307	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sort of shorthand.
L630306	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Code, I've heard a lot about this.
L630305	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
L630304	u3398	m224	STANLEY	That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
L630984	u3390	m224	LAURA	Cause I like it.
L630983	u3380	m224	DONNA	Why do you do it, Laura?
L630982	u3390	m224	LAURA	And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
L630981	u3380	m224	DONNA	But I love you, Laura.
L630980	u3390	m224	LAURA	All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
L630979	u3380	m224	DONNA	Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
L630978	u3390	m224	LAURA	I can't help you there.
L630977	u3380	m224	DONNA	How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
L630976	u3390	m224	LAURA	WE got it back, that's all.
L630975	u3380	m224	DONNA	How did the car get back here?
L630974	u3390	m224	LAURA	What can I tell you?
L630973	u3380	m224	DONNA	I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
L630972	u3390	m224	LAURA	No.
L630971	u3380	m224	DONNA	You're not mad at me?
L630970	u3390	m224	LAURA	I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
L630969	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura, I am your friend.
L630968	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, you should forget about last night.
L630967	u3380	m224	DONNA	I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
L630950	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not you, Donna, not you.
L630949	u3380	m224	DONNA	I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
L630948	u3390	m224	LAURA	Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
L630947	u3380	m224	DONNA	Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
L630946	u3390	m224	LAURA	Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
L630910	u3390	m224	LAURA	YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
L630909	u3380	m224	DONNA	No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
L630907	u3390	m224	LAURA	Nothing.
L630906	u3380	m224	DONNA	What are you doing?
L630890	u3390	m224	LAURA	Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
L630889	u3380	m224	DONNA	If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
L630888	u3380	m224	DONNA	Dancing.
L630887	u3390	m224	LAURA	You mean Fred and Ginger?
L630886	u3380	m224	DONNA	Where are the Cookies?
L630885	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
L630884	u3390	m224	LAURA	Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
L630883	u3380	m224	DONNA	Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
L630882	u3390	m224	LAURA	No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
L630881	u3380	m224	DONNA	Where are you going?
L630807	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, you're the muffin.
L630806	u3380	m224	DONNA	Goodbye, Muffin.
L630789	u3390	m224	LAURA	Donna, you are a muffin.
L630788	u3380	m224	DONNA	You want a muffin?
L630787	u3390	m224	LAURA	If I can smoke it.
L630786	u3380	m224	DONNA	This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
L630785	u3390	m224	LAURA	Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
L630784	u3380	m224	DONNA	I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
L630783	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, I want to smoke.
L630782	u3380	m224	DONNA	Do you want to talk?
L630781	u3390	m224	LAURA	You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
L630780	u3380	m224	DONNA	Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
L630779	u3390	m224	LAURA	Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
L630778	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
L630777	u3390	m224	LAURA	I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
L630776	u3380	m224	DONNA	What is it Laura? What's wrong?
L630775	u3380	m224	DONNA	Of course...
L630774	u3390	m224	LAURA	Donna, are you my best friend?
L630773	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura?
L630672	u3380	m224	DONNA	Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
L630671	u3390	m224	LAURA	Sure. What do you want me to call you?
L630670	u3380	m224	DONNA	Call me.
L630669	u3390	m224	LAURA	Okay, I suppose I should go home.
L630668	u3380	m224	DONNA	Maybe I better start our homework.
L630667	u3390	m224	LAURA	Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
L630666	u3380	m224	DONNA	Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
L630664	u3390	m224	LAURA	James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
L630663	u3380	m224	DONNA	Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
L630662	u3390	m224	LAURA	Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
L630661	u3380	m224	DONNA	"Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that ""lasting love""... ""true love""."
L630660	u3390	m224	LAURA	Well, why not?
L630659	u3380	m224	DONNA	Oh god, Laura.
L630658	u3390	m224	LAURA	Maybe.
L630657	u3380	m224	DONNA	You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
L630656	u3390	m224	LAURA	Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
L630655	u3380	m224	DONNA	Are you going to see James tonight?
L630628	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
L630627	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
L630626	u3390	m224	LAURA	You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
L630625	u3380	m224	DONNA	You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
L630624	u3390	m224	LAURA	I don't know what to do.
L630623	u3380	m224	DONNA	"Are you going to tell him about that ""someone else""?"
L630622	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
L630621	u3380	m224	DONNA	Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
L630620	u3390	m224	LAURA	He probably wanted to drive over.
L630619	u3380	m224	DONNA	The usual, 9:15.
L630618	u3390	m224	LAURA	When?
L630617	u3380	m224	DONNA	James called me last night looking for you.
L630616	u3390	m224	LAURA	Thanks.
L630615	u3380	m224	DONNA	You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
L630614	u3390	m224	LAURA	Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
L630613	u3380	m224	DONNA	Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
L630612	u3390	m224	LAURA	Noooo...
L630611	u3380	m224	DONNA	You didn't do your homework?
L630610	u3390	m224	LAURA	If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
L631111	u3381	m224	ED	Brother, I hear you talkin'.
L631110	u3395	m224	PETE	Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
L631108	u3395	m224	PETE	Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
L631107	u3381	m224	ED	I did? I didn't see anything.
L631106	u3395	m224	PETE	You missed somethin', Ed.
L631105	u3395	m224	PETE	Yep...  Yes...  It is.
L631104	u3381	m224	ED	Nice night.
L631103	u3395	m224	PETE	I haven't got it yet.
L631102	u3381	m224	ED	You got it.
L631101	u3395	m224	PETE	Fill 'er up.
L631100	u3381	m224	ED	What'll it be?
L631099	u3395	m224	PETE	Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
L631098	u3381	m224	ED	"You know what that Big ""E"" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm."
L631097	u3395	m224	PETE	"No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big ""E"" starin' at me."
L631096	u3381	m224	ED	Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
L630704	u3382	m224	HAROLD	I'm so sorry, Laura.
L630703	u3390	m224	LAURA	He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
L630702	u3382	m224	HAROLD	What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
L630701	u3382	m224	HAROLD	But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
L630700	u3390	m224	LAURA	I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
L630699	u3382	m224	HAROLD	Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
L630698	u3390	m224	LAURA	You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
L630693	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, yes... yes...
L630692	u3382	m224	HAROLD	No... No...
L630691	u3390	m224	LAURA	He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
L630690	u3382	m224	HAROLD	What does Bob say?
L630689	u3390	m224	LAURA	The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
L630688	u3390	m224	LAURA	"Bob is real. He's been ""having"" me since I was 12."
L630687	u3382	m224	HAROLD	Maybe.
L630686	u3390	m224	LAURA	The pages are gone. That's real.
L630685	u3382	m224	HAROLD	But Bob isn't real.
L630684	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bob.
L630683	u3382	m224	HAROLD	Who would do that?
L630682	u3390	m224	LAURA	My secret diary. There are pages missing.
L631146	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Send me a kiss.
L631145	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
L631144	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
L631143	u3390	m224	LAURA	I already made you two tapes.
L631142	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Did you make me a tape?
L631141	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm not.
L631140	u3385	m224	JACOBY	A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
L631139	u3390	m224	LAURA	I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
L631138	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
L631228	u3390	m224	LAURA	Let's go all the way.
L631227	u3386	m224	JACQUES	We're on our way, Baby.
L631226	u3390	m224	LAURA	Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
L631225	u3386	m224	JACQUES	Right on time, baby.
L630935	u3386	m224	JACQUES	But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
L630934	u3390	m224	LAURA	What? She asked about my father?
L630933	u3386	m224	JACQUES	That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
L630919	u3386	m224	JACQUES	And what a muffin you have.
L630918	u3390	m224	LAURA	I am The Muffin.
L630917	u3386	m224	JACQUES	"No ""Jacques"". I am the Great Went."
L630916	u3390	m224	LAURA	Hey, Jacques...
L630915	u3386	m224	JACQUES	Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
L631218	u3390	m224	LAURA	Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
L631217	u3387	m224	JAMES	See what?
L631216	u3390	m224	LAURA	You want to see...
L631215	u3387	m224	JAMES	What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
L631214	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bobby killed a guy.
L631213	u3387	m224	JAMES	What?
L631212	u3390	m224	LAURA	When he finds out.
L631211	u3387	m224	JAMES	What?
L631210	u3390	m224	LAURA	Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
L631209	u3390	m224	LAURA	I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
L631208	u3387	m224	JAMES	Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
L631207	u3390	m224	LAURA	You mean the ones you pity.
L631206	u3387	m224	JAMES	You always hurt the ones you love.
L631205	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, Laura...
L631204	u3387	m224	JAMES	Oh, Laura.
L631203	u3390	m224	LAURA	Everything, but everything.
L631202	u3387	m224	JAMES	What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
L631201	u3390	m224	LAURA	You know it and I know it.
L631200	u3387	m224	JAMES	What do you mean?
L631199	u3390	m224	LAURA	That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
L631198	u3387	m224	JAMES	What the hell is wrong with you?
L631053	u3390	m224	LAURA	I just can't, James. I can't do it.
L631052	u3387	m224	JAMES	What's going on?
L631051	u3390	m224	LAURA	I can't tonight.
L631050	u3387	m224	JAMES	What about tonight?
L631049	u3390	m224	LAURA	Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
L631048	u3387	m224	JAMES	This afternoon?
L631047	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not now.
L631046	u3387	m224	JAMES	I've got to see you.
L630848	u3387	m224	JAMES	When am I going to see you?
L630847	u3390	m224	LAURA	James...
L630846	u3387	m224	JAMES	You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
L630845	u3390	m224	LAURA	How can I be together if I'm not together?
L630844	u3387	m224	JAMES	We were supposed to be together.
L630843	u3390	m224	LAURA	You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
L630842	u3387	m224	JAMES	Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
L630643	u3390	m224	LAURA	Gobble, gobble, gobble.
L630642	u3387	m224	JAMES	You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
L630641	u3390	m224	LAURA	James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
L630640	u3387	m224	JAMES	It does matter. We're in love.
L630639	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
L630638	u3387	m224	JAMES	Why? It does.
L630637	u3390	m224	LAURA	Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
L630636	u3387	m224	JAMES	Laura, do you love me?
L630634	u3390	m224	LAURA	Okay.
L630633	u3387	m224	JAMES	Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
L630632	u3390	m224	LAURA	James...
L631081	u3391	m224	LELAND	They were looking for wood.
L631080	u3388	m224	JERRY	History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
L631077	u3388	m224	JERRY	Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
L631076	u3391	m224	LELAND	Trees?
L631075	u3388	m224	JERRY	You're getting warmer.
L631074	u3391	m224	LELAND	Sex?
L631073	u3388	m224	JERRY	You'd think so.
L631072	u3391	m224	LELAND	Eating?
L631071	u3388	m224	JERRY	No.
L631070	u3391	m224	LELAND	Hiking?
L631069	u3388	m224	JERRY	No.
L631068	u3391	m224	LELAND	Boating?
L631067	u3388	m224	JERRY	Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
L630966	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	We throw away the whole head.
L630965	u3389	m224	JOSIE	I understand.
L630964	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
L630963	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
L630962	u3389	m224	JOSIE	Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
L630961	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
L630960	u3389	m224	JOSIE	Fish eyes?
L630959	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
L630958	u3389	m224	JOSIE	I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
L630957	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	What are you afraid of? What people think?
L630956	u3389	m224	JOSIE	That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
L630955	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	Josie, I think we should go public.
L631194	u3396	m224	SARAH	Good night, sweetheart.
L631193	u3390	m224	LAURA	Good night, Mom.
L631155	u3396	m224	SARAH	It's a school night... back by nine.
L631154	u3390	m224	LAURA	If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
L631153	u3396	m224	SARAH	Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
L631152	u3390	m224	LAURA	Where's Dad?
L631151	u3396	m224	SARAH	Sure you do, it's good for you.
L631150	u3390	m224	LAURA	I hate asparagus.
L630862	u3390	m224	LAURA	Mom, take it easy.
L630861	u3396	m224	SARAH	My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
L630860	u3390	m224	LAURA	Mom... what are you wearing?
L630859	u3396	m224	SARAH	Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
L630712	u3396	m224	SARAH	Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
L630711	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm sorry, Mom.
L630710	u3396	m224	SARAH	Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
L630709	u3390	m224	LAURA	I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
L630708	u3396	m224	SARAH	I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
L630707	u3390	m224	LAURA	What were you doing in my room?
L630706	u3396	m224	SARAH	You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
L630679	u3390	m224	LAURA	What?
L630678	u3396	m224	SARAH	Laura.
L630677	u3390	m224	LAURA	I forgot my books at school.
L630676	u3396	m224	SARAH	Sure honey, what's the hurry?
L630675	u3390	m224	LAURA	Can I take the car?
L631239	u3390	m224	LAURA	NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
L631238	u3391	m224	LELAND	I always thought you knew it was me.
L631237	u3390	m224	LAURA	NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
L631236	u3391	m224	LELAND	DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
L631149	u3390	m224	LAURA	Stay away from me.
L631148	u3391	m224	LELAND	Laura. What's wrong this morning?
L631024	u3390	m224	LAURA	I was down the street.
L631023	u3391	m224	LELAND	You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
L631022	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, I thought I saw you.
L631021	u3391	m224	LELAND	No.
L631020	u3390	m224	LAURA	Did you come home during the day last week?
L631019	u3391	m224	LELAND	Yes.
L631018	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad?
L631017	u3391	m224	LELAND	Yes.
L631016	u3390	m224	LAURA	Are you sure you're okay?
L631013	u3391	m224	LELAND	Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
L631012	u3390	m224	LAURA	Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
L631011	u3391	m224	LELAND	We're late to get to your mother.
L631010	u3390	m224	LAURA	No.
L631009	u3391	m224	LELAND	No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
L631008	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
L630852	u3391	m224	LELAND	A special friend?
L630851	u3390	m224	LAURA	A friend from school.
L630850	u3391	m224	LELAND	Who was that?
L630818	u3391	m224	LELAND	Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
L630817	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad...
L630816	u3391	m224	LELAND	Let me see.
L630814	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not really.
L630813	u3391	m224	LELAND	Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
L630812	u3390	m224	LAURA	...school's fine...
L630811	u3391	m224	LELAND	School?
L630810	u3390	m224	LAURA	Fine.
L630809	u3391	m224	LELAND	Hi, honey, how's Donna?
L630718	u3390	m224	LAURA	But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
L630717	u3391	m224	LELAND	"The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, ""Hello, my name is Leland Palmer""."
L630716	u3391	m224	LELAND	Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
L630715	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad.
L630832	u3391	m224	LELAND	Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
L630831	u3396	m224	SARAH	Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
L630830	u3391	m224	LELAND	How do you know what she doesn't like?
L630829	u3396	m224	SARAH	Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
L630828	u3391	m224	LELAND	Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
L630827	u3396	m224	SARAH	How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
L630826	u3391	m224	LELAND	Bobby didn't give you this?
L630825	u3396	m224	SARAH	They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
L630824	u3391	m224	LELAND	Did you get this from your lover?
L630822	u3391	m224	LELAND	Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
L630821	u3396	m224	SARAH	Leland...
L630820	u3391	m224	LELAND	Look at this finger here.
L630819	u3396	m224	SARAH	Leland, what are you doing?
L630720	u3391	m224	LELAND	This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
L630719	u3396	m224	SARAH	Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
L630714	u3396	m224	SARAH	Oh, Leland.
L630713	u3391	m224	LELAND	"Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  ""I'm hungry""."
L631015	u3391	m224	LELAND	Nothing, I chickened out.
L631014	u3399	m224	TERESA	What's wrong?
L631007	u3391	m224	LELAND	That's right.
L631006	u3399	m224	TERESA	I don't know.
L631005	u3391	m224	LELAND	Who am I?
L631004	u3399	m224	TERESA	What are you doing?
L631003	u3399	m224	TERESA	I can arrange that. I like that.
L631002	u3391	m224	LELAND	Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
L631001	u3399	m224	TERESA	When's the next business trip, big fella?
L630872	u3392	m224	LEO	What did you say?
L630871	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
L630870	u3392	m224	LEO	I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
L630869	u3397	m224	SHELLY	As if I didn't know.
L630868	u3392	m224	LEO	That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
L630867	u3392	m224	LEO	Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
L630866	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Lay off the bennies, Leo.
L630865	u3392	m224	LEO	Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
L630764	u3394	m224	NORMA	Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
L630763	u3397	m224	SHELLY	"If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the ""Meals on Wheels""."
L630762	u3394	m224	NORMA	Come back as soon as you can.
L630761	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Norma, are you alright?
L630760	u3394	m224	NORMA	There's no one here.
L630759	u3397	m224	SHELLY	You're right. There's no one here.
L630758	u3394	m224	NORMA	What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
L630757	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
L630746	u3394	m224	NORMA	You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
L630745	u3397	m224	SHELLY	I'm kind of busy, Norma.
L630744	u3394	m224	NORMA	"Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the ""Meals on Wheels""?"
L645695	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Come on out!  We're friends!
L645694	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Hey, there - open up!
L645687	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
L645686	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Hey, how about that!
L645685	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	We'd be in all the papers!
L645684	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
L645673	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
L645672	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	It's no meteor, that's for sure!
L645671	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
L645670	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
L645665	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Let's go.
L645664	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
L645663	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
L645662	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Looks almost cold now, don't it?
L645945	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.
L645944	u3424	m226	CHIEF OF STAFF	Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
L645943	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
L645942	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	All right - I've seen enough!
L645941	u3424	m226	CHIEF OF STAFF	Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
L645924	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
L645923	u3424	m226	CHIEF OF STAFF	Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
L645922	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
L646054	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	But I think I know where she'll be....
L646053	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	You look kinda lost yourself.
L646050	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
L646049	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	Hurry up!  Jump in!
L646046	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
L646045	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	There's nobody left around here now.
L646044	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
L646043	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
L646023	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Don't let's lose each other.
L646022	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
L646021	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
L646020	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I wonder if they're going through this too...?
L646019	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
L645988	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
L645987	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	How'd you guess?
L645986	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
L645985	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	My kid brother has one.  You know why?
L645984	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
L645983	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
L645982	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
L645981	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
L645913	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
L645912	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They've blocked it!
L645909	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
L645908	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
L645907	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
L645905	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
L645904	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
L645903	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	What was it like?
L645902	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It was...  ...one of them!
L645901	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Nothing there now.
L645898	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Hours.  I've been so scared...!
L645897	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	How long was I out?
L645895	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
L645894	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
L645893	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I liked him.
L645892	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
L645891	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
L645890	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
L645889	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
L645888	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
L645887	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
L645886	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
L645885	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
L645884	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
L645883	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
L645882	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
L645881	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Don't you live at home?
L645880	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
L645878	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
L645877	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Where are we?
L645876	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	It's gone now.
L645875	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Is that... machine...?
L645874	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
L645873	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
L645844	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
L645843	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
L645842	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Sure...get in!
L645841	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Can you handle one of these?
L645840	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
L645789	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Would you like some coffee, General?
L645788	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
L645776	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
L645775	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
L645774	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
L645773	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	The troops are certainly moving in here!
L645720	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Automobile ignitions are insulated.
L645719	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	How does it happen cars are running?
L645712	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
L645711	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They've all stopped at the same time.
L645640	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
L645639	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
L645638	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I didn't know how to stop you...!
L645637	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
L645636	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Like...ah...
L645635	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	What's he like?
L645634	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I do know him...slightly.
L645633	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	How can you say that when you don't know him!
L645632	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Aw, he isn't that good...!
L645631	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
L645630	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
L645629	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
L645628	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Did it do you any good?
L645627	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
L645626	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	You seem to know a lot about him.
L645625	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
L645624	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
L645623	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It hit sideways and skidded in.
L645622	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
L645621	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
L645620	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
L645619	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Did you see it come down?
L645617	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
L645616	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Is that it over there?
L645734	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
L645733	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
L645732	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	What is that gizmo?!
L645718	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
L645717	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	That needle ain't pointing north!
L645716	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Have you got a pocket compass?
L645715	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
L645714	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	That's what knocked the phones out, too.
L646031	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
L646030	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	No.  I thought you had them.
L646029	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
L646017	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
L646016	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
L646015	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
L646014	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
L646013	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
L645968	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	It might give us something.
L645967	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
L645598	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
L645597	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
L645596	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
L645595	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
L645592	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	Looks like the fishing was good.
L645591	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Right.
L645590	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
L645815	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
L645814	u3426	m226	COLONEL	It's always been a good persuader.
L645813	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	Colonel - shooting's no good!
L645785	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
L645784	u3426	m226	COLONEL	I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
L645783	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	So is the town, I notice!
L645782	u3426	m226	COLONEL	There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
L645807	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	They'll probably move at dawn.
L645806	u3426	m226	COLONEL	Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
L645805	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
L645804	u3426	m226	COLONEL	My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
L645802	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
L645801	u3426	m226	COLONEL	We will, sir!
L645794	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
L645793	u3426	m226	COLONEL	Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
L645792	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
L645787	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
L645786	u3426	m226	COLONEL	General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
L645823	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
L645822	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
L645819	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
L645818	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
L645817	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	They are living creatures out there.
L645659	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
L645658	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They don't do much of anything...!
L645645	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
L645644	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
L645578	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It was nearer than that.
L645577	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
L645589	u3432	m226	RADIO VOICE	Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
L645588	u3433	m226	RANGER	I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
L645587	u3432	m226	RADIO VOICE	Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
L645586	u3433	m226	RANGER	We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
L645585	u3432	m226	RADIO VOICE	D.O. to number three..come in.
L645584	u3433	m226	RANGER	Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
L645693	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
L645692	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	They'll understand us, all right!
L645689	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Welcome to California!
L645688	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	What'll we say to 'em?
L645681	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
L645680	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	Maybe these are not men - not like us.
L645678	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	How would I know...!
L645677	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
L645676	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Must be somebody in there.
L645609	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
L645608	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
L646629	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like weird calls, by any chance?
L646628	u3439	m227	BOB	I don't follow.
L646627	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
L646626	u3439	m227	BOB	I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
L646625	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
L646624	u3439	m227	BOB	We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
L646623	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes, but...
L646622	u3439	m227	BOB	I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
L646621	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What?
L646620	u3439	m227	BOB	Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
L646618	u3439	m227	BOB	I'm sure we can match any offer.
L646617	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And I...I've got other things happening.
L646616	u3439	m227	BOB	Come on.  Kids love horror.
L646615	u3443	m227	HEATHER	So I don't know about horror.
L646614	u3439	m227	BOB	So?
L646613	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
L646612	u3439	m227	BOB	Sort of a trial balloon.
L646611	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You mean that was a...
L646610	u3439	m227	BOB	He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
L646609	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Can I read it?
L646608	u3439	m227	BOB	He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
L646607	u3443	m227	HEATHER	The nightmares.
L646606	u3439	m227	BOB	He's very excited about it.
L646605	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Which means he's having nightmares again?
L646604	u3439	m227	BOB	Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
L646603	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
L646602	u3439	m227	BOB	We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
L646601	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
L646659	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
L646658	u3440	m227	CHASE	I'll be there in three hours.
L646657	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.
L646656	u3440	m227	CHASE	Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
L646655	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
L646654	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather, has there been another call?
L646653	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like Freddy.
L646652	u3440	m227	CHASE	Like what?
L646651	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
L646650	u3440	m227	CHASE	What?  What kind of episode?
L646649	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He's had some sort of...episode.
L646647	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase, it's Dylan!
L646646	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
L646645	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase, you'd better come home.
L646644	u3440	m227	CHASE	What's up?
L646643	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase. Hi...
L646642	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather?
L646505	u3440	m227	CHASE	48 hours.  Back before you know it.
L646504	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Guess so.
L646503	u3440	m227	CHASE	I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
L646502	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Just be careful, okay?
L646501	u3440	m227	CHASE	You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
L646500	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
L646499	u3440	m227	CHASE	Maybe you should tell me your dream.
L646498	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What if it isn't over?
L646497	u3440	m227	CHASE	Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
L646496	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, you don't.
L646495	u3440	m227	CHASE	You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
L646494	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
L646491	u3440	m227	CHASE	Hasn't been another call, has there?
L646490	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
L646489	u3440	m227	CHASE	Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
L646486	u3443	m227	HEATHER	More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
L646485	u3440	m227	CHASE	You get any sleep last night?
L646484	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
L646481	u3440	m227	CHASE	I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
L646480	u3443	m227	HEATHER	One of mom's cups got broken.
L646475	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No biggie, really.
L646474	u3440	m227	CHASE	Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
L646460	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase...
L646459	u3440	m227	CHASE	Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
L646950	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
L646949	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	What?
L646948	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
L646947	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
L646942	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
L646941	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
L646940	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want my kid out of here now!
L646920	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
L646919	u3443	m227	HEATHER	DO you mind...
L646897	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Everything is not fine!
L646896	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
L646895	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He was just here!
L646894	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
L646884	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
L646883	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Doctor...
L646875	u3443	m227	HEATHER	They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
L646874	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	These look quite fresh.
L646873	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
L646872	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
L646868	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Oh my God...
L646867	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
L646866	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Is he all right?
L646865	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
L646808	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
L646807	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like what?
L646806	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Absolutely.
L646805	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Does he have to stay here over night?
L646801	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No...
L646800	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
L646799	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.
L646798	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Diabetes?
L646797	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.
L646796	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Any history of epilepsy in your family?
L647002	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Read me some?
L647001	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
L647000	u3442	m227	DYLAN	A story?
L646999	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What...what is that?
L646998	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Here.
L646997	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, where's the man?
L646972	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Coming for you...
L646971	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
L646916	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
L646915	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
L646913	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
L646912	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Right 'cross the freeway.
L646911	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
L646909	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
L646908	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
L646907	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You okay, champ?
L646814	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Home, that's right.
L646813	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Home.
L646744	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Can you come with me in my dreams?
L646743	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
L646742	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Why does God let there be bad things?
L646741	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
L646740	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Do you have to die to see God?
L646736	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
L646735	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And...what's the man doing?
L646734	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
L646733	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Your bed?
L646732	u3442	m227	DYLAN	In my bed.
L646727	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
L646726	u3442	m227	DYLAN	I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
L646691	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Not sleepy.
L646690	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
L646689	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
L646688	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
L646683	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Right.
L646682	u3442	m227	DYLAN	He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
L646681	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He's on his way.
L646680	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Don't let the bedbugs bite.
L646679	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
L646676	u3442	m227	DYLAN	The mean old man with the claws.
L646675	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Who?
L646673	u3443	m227	HEATHER	They were safe and could sleep.
L646672	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe.
L646670	u3442	m227	DYLAN	No.  Tonight.  It's important!
L646669	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Tomorrow night.
L646668	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Say how they find their way back home.
L646667	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Time for sleep.
L646664	u3442	m227	DYLAN	I like this story.
L646663	u3443	m227	HEATHER	This is going to give you nightmares.
L646662	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Finish, please!
L646661	u3443	m227	HEATHER	...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside.  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
L646638	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Rex?  Who's Rex?
L646637	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Rex saved me.
L646550	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Bye.
L646549	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
L646511	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What?
L646510	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Someone's coming.
L646488	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
L646487	u3442	m227	DYLAN	You going away?
L646473	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You have a fever, sweetie?
L646472	u3442	m227	DYLAN	no.
L646784	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
L646783	u3443	m227	HEATHER	When do you think it'll be done?
L646782	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
L646781	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
L646780	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Call it a guess...
L646779	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yeah...how'd you know?
L646778	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Darker.  More...evil?
L646775	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
L646774	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
L646773	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
L646772	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Heather?  You doing okay?
L646577	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
L646576	u3443	m227	HEATHER	In what, a romantic comedy?
L646574	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
L646573	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
L646572	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I'm fine.
L646571	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	You okay?
L646970	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Yeah, sure.
L646969	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Fred Krueger did it.
L646968	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	What are you talking about?
L646967	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know how Chase really died.
L646963	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
L646962	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Holy...
L646956	u3443	m227	HEATHER	John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
L646955	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You're right.  That sounds crazy!
L646954	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
L646953	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You got it.  What's happening?
L646952	u3443	m227	HEATHER	John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
L646951	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
L646766	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You really think Dylan's okay?
L646765	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
L646764	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Really?
L646763	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
L646762	u3443	m227	HEATHER	A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
L646761	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Steady...
L646760	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Freddy, for all I know.
L646759	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
L646758	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I've never mentioned it to him.
L646757	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
L646756	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
L646755	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Seemed, not was.
L646754	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
L646753	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You didn't jump in.
L646752	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
L646751	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You're not crazy, by the way.
L646747	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
L646746	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
L646722	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
L646721	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What...happened?
L646706	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want to see for myself.
L646705	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
L646704	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want to see the body.
L646697	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
L646696	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.
L646695	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	Is Chase Porter your husband?
L646694	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes?
L646693	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	Heather Langenkamp?
L646532	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I just can't.
L646531	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	Listen, dammit.
L646530	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I'm sorry, I can't.
L646529	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	You're kidding, right?
L646528	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
L646527	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	The car's no there yet?
L646526	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
L646525	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	Studio B.
L646864	u3447	m227	JULIE	They wouldn't let me...
L646863	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
L646641	u3447	m227	JULIE	Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
L646640	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
L646553	u3447	m227	JULIE	'S okay.
L646552	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
L646551	u3447	m227	JULIE	I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
L646522	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
L646521	u3447	m227	JULIE	Heather, what is it?
L646515	u3447	m227	JULIE	Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
L646514	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
L646855	u3451	m227	WES	Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
L646854	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Choice?  What kind of choice?
L646853	u3451	m227	WES	The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
L646852	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
L646851	u3451	m227	WES	Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
L646850	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
L646849	u3451	m227	WES	But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
L646848	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That was Nancy, not me!
L646847	u3451	m227	WES	Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
L646846	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Me?  Why me?
L646845	u3451	m227	WES	Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
L646844	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
L646843	u3451	m227	WES	Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
L646842	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Then what is he doing?
L646841	u3451	m227	WES	That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
L646840	u3443	m227	HEATHER	If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
L646839	u3451	m227	WES	Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
L646838	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
L646837	u3451	m227	WES	Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
L646836	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like the Genie in the bottle.
L646835	u3451	m227	WES	By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
L646834	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Captured?  How?
L646833	u3451	m227	WES	It can be captured, sometimes.
L646832	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
L646831	u3451	m227	WES	I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
L646830	u3443	m227	HEATHER	This is still a script we're talking about, right?
L646829	u3451	m227	WES	Killing innocence, one way or the other.
L646828	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What's that?
L646827	u3451	m227	WES	I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
L646569	u3445	m227	HOST	Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
L646568	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Robert?  I...
L646567	u3445	m227	HOST	And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
L646566	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
L646564	u3443	m227	HEATHER	My child?  No...but...
L646563	u3445	m227	HOST	Do you let your child watch your movies?
L646562	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, not really.  I...
L646561	u3445	m227	HOST	Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
L646560	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
L646597	u3450	m227	SARA	Me too.
L646596	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Black's fine.
L646595	u3450	m227	SARA	Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
L646594	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Coffee'd be nice.
L646593	u3450	m227	SARA	Can I get you something to drink?
L646586	u3450	m227	SARA	Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
L646585	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Now?
L646584	u3450	m227	SARA	No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
L646583	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Uh...sure...when?
L646582	u3450	m227	SARA	Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
L646581	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
L646580	u3450	m227	SARA	Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
L646579	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes?
L23798	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
L23797	u3584	m236	ROBY	Do you remember the pyramid?
L23796	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	... I don't know...
L23795	u3584	m236	ROBY	Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
L23792	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
L23791	u3584	m236	ROBY	Are you in pain?
L23373	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
L23372	u3584	m236	ROBY	There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
L23371	u3584	m236	ROBY	Or something will be able to see us.
L23370	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
L23349	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
L23348	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engines off.
L23347	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Kill drive engines.
L23346	u3584	m236	ROBY	Locked.
L23321	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
L23320	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Hell, we're equipped --
L23319	u3584	m236	ROBY	If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
L23259	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
L23258	u3584	m236	ROBY	Cattle ranch!
L23257	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
L23245	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, it's you all right.
L23244	u3584	m236	ROBY	I feel like shit...
L23243	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Is that you, Roby?
L23242	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh... God... am I cold...
L23822	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
L23821	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Breathe deeply.
L23820	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
L23819	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's wrong?
L23802	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
L23801	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
L23794	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	God I'm hungry.
L23793	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
L23790	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
L23789	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Don't you remember?
L23788	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Wretched.  What happened to me?
L23787	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How do you feel, Dell?
L23554	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
L23553	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
L23552	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
L23551	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Are you okay in there?
L23549	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Take care.
L23548	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
L23545	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No, I want to go in.
L23544	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
L23536	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you see anything in the hole?
L23535	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
L23534	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can we come up?
L23531	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Sure.
L23530	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You want to try?
L23529	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Maybe we can get in by the top.
L23494	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What is it, I can't --
L23493	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
L23492	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Take a look.
L23491	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What is it?
L23490	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm on my way.
L23489	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
L23488	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's up?
L23487	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
L23486	u3585	m236	STANDARD	This is Chaz.
L23444	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	But functioning.
L23443	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just machinery.
L23437	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, you'll follow me.
L23436	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'll go first.
L23429	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
L23428	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Looks like a derelict.
L23427	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
L23401	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Receiving.
L23400	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
L23386	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
L23385	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Close enough to walk to!
L23345	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
L23344	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then take her down.
L23343	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	It's... basalt.  Rock.
L23342	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Is it solid?
L23341	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
L23340	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's the terrain down there?
L23339	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
L23336	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
L23335	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Activate lifter quads.
L23328	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'll see what I can do.
L23327	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
L23323	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
L23322	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
L23313	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
L23312	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Gravity?
L23311	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah.  Two hours.
L23310	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Any rotation?
L23307	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	That's what I'm going to do.
L23306	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you get it a little closer?
L23273	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
L23272	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Where the hell are we?
L23271	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I got it.  Oh boy.
L23270	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, plot our location.
L23269	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I don't recognize that constellation.
L23265	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, scan the whole sky.
L23264	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Where's Irth?
L23294	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
L23293	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
L23290	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	Unknown.
L23289	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, what language was that?
L23288	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Play it for us, please.
L23287	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have recorded the transmission.
L23285	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	A voice transmission.
L23284	u3585	m236	STANDARD	A transmission?
L23283	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
L23282	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
L24123	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
L24122	u3584	m236	ROBY	Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
L23523	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
L23522	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
L23521	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yes!
L23292	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
L23291	u3584	m236	ROBY	Unknown!  What do you mean?
L23281	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
L23280	u3584	m236	ROBY	What?  <u>Why</u>?
L23279	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
L23980	u3581	m236	FAUST	It's still in the ship?
L23979	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
L23978	u3581	m236	FAUST	Dead!
L23977	u3584	m236	ROBY	Dead.
L23976	u3581	m236	FAUST	What happened?  Where's Sandy?
L23921	u3581	m236	FAUST	All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
L23920	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where does that go?
L23885	u3581	m236	FAUST	Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
L23884	u3584	m236	ROBY	What happened to the lights?
L23883	u3581	m236	FAUST	That way.
L23882	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay.
L23879	u3581	m236	FAUST	Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
L23878	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where's it coming from?
L23850	u3584	m236	ROBY	We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
L23849	u3581	m236	FAUST	We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
L23833	u3581	m236	FAUST	Shit...
L23832	u3584	m236	ROBY	But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
L23817	u3584	m236	ROBY	I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
L23816	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
L23815	u3584	m236	ROBY	You know what they make this stuff out of?
L23814	u3581	m236	FAUST	It grows on you.
L23813	u3584	m236	ROBY	You like this shit?
L23543	u3584	m236	ROBY	"It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  ""... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... ""  And that's all it could translate."
L23542	u3581	m236	FAUST	What do you mean?
L23541	u3584	m236	ROBY	The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
L23540	u3581	m236	FAUST	Why, what's wrong?
L23539	u3584	m236	ROBY	Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
L23538	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yes?  What is it?
L23520	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
L23519	u3581	m236	FAUST	Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
L23463	u3584	m236	ROBY	Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
L23462	u3581	m236	FAUST	What?
L23461	u3584	m236	ROBY	<u>He</u> died.
L23379	u3584	m236	ROBY	How's it coming on the engines?
L23378	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yeah!
L23377	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hello, Faust!
L23362	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.  Talk to you.
L23361	u3584	m236	ROBY	Well, get started.
L23360	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hard to say.
L23359	u3584	m236	ROBY	How long to fix?
L23355	u3584	m236	ROBY	Has the hull been breached?
L23354	u3581	m236	FAUST	Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
L23942	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Right.
L23941	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
L23925	u3582	m236	HUNTER	-- And the cooling unit on the other.
L23924	u3581	m236	FAUST	That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
L23838	u3581	m236	FAUST	The water will still recycle.
L23837	u3582	m236	HUNTER	And then we run out of food and oxygen.
L23827	u3581	m236	FAUST	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
L23826	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh, no.  Oh, no.
L23804	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
L23803	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
L23624	u3581	m236	FAUST	Is it alive?
L23623	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh -- God -- oh --
L23610	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
L23609	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hurt!  How?
L23608	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
L23607	u3581	m236	FAUST	What the hell's going on?
L23996	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And be right back.
L23995	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right. 
L23994	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
L23991	u3581	m236	FAUST	You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
L23990	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, I don't want us separated.
L23989	u3581	m236	FAUST	There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
L23973	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.
L23972	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
L23971	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
L23927	u3581	m236	FAUST	Poison gas...
L23926	u3585	m236	STANDARD	So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
L23903	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well we better do something.
L23902	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
L23873	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
L23872	u3581	m236	FAUST	It's clear.
L23864	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I hope not.
L23863	u3581	m236	FAUST	Might even incinerate the damn thing.
L23844	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
L23843	u3581	m236	FAUST	We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
L23842	u3585	m236	STANDARD	So does anybody have any suggestions?
L23812	u3581	m236	FAUST	I kind of like it.
L23811	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
L23775	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
L23774	u3581	m236	FAUST	This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
L23762	u3581	m236	FAUST	The engines are fixed.
L23761	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What?
L23760	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hey, guess what?
L23631	u3581	m236	FAUST	Here, let me try.
L23630	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's really on there tight.
L23470	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.
L23469	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
L23468	u3581	m236	FAUST	Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
L23467	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And when will you be ready to do that?
L23466	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
L23465	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
L23358	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Damn it!  How long to fix?
L23357	u3581	m236	FAUST	Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
L23831	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
L23830	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
L23706	u3582	m236	HUNTER	You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
L23705	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
L23690	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
L23689	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It makes me sick to see him like that.
L23679	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
L23678	u3582	m236	HUNTER	But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
L23677	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
L23667	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It's eating a hole in the floor!
L23666	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	God, that smoke's poisonous!
L23661	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
L23660	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
L23659	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
L23658	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
L23650	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
L23649	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
L23648	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How does he breathe?
L23647	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
L23646	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Where did it come from?
L23640	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
L23639	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
L24100	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can't, the acid will pour out!
L24099	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The flamethrower!
L24098	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let me go first; you stay behind me.
L24097	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
L24081	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
L24080	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
L24078	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
L24077	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It will be.
L24073	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
L24072	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Should we go outside and bring him in?
L24071	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
L24057	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
L24056	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The flamethrower needs more fuel.
L24055	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
L24051	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
L24050	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Good!  That's good!
L24049	u3585	m236	STANDARD	If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
L24031	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's time for drastic remedies.
L24030	u3582	m236	HUNTER	<u>How</u>?
L24029	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
L24028	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
L24021	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Does anybody know what happened?
L24020	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh my God.
L24019	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got six hours left.
L23988	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
L23987	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
L23986	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
L23982	u3582	m236	HUNTER	At least it can't get up here now.
L23981	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
L23936	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Got a better idea?
L23935	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Sounds like a rough one.
L23934	u3585	m236	STANDARD	While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
L23929	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
L23928	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
L23905	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Don't be an idiot.
L23904	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
L23866	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How do we locate the creature?
L23865	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
L23852	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
L23851	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
L23742	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.
L23741	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
L23740	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you do anything for him?
L23739	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yes.
L23738	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Still unconscious?
L23737	u3582	m236	HUNTER	He's running a fever.
L23736	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How's Broussard?
L23735	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yes?
L23723	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Maybe we can catch it.
L23722	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
L23721	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
L23720	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
L23719	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Now we're in for it.
L23717	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Maybe it wasn't always dead.
L23716	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
L23715	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
L23714	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What do you mean?
L23713	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
L23712	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'll come with you.
L23711	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
L23672	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Careful, don't get under it!
L23671	u3585	m236	STANDARD	There.  Should be coming through about there.
L23636	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Ask him.
L23635	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Hey now, what is this?
L23628	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It wouldn't come.
L23627	u3582	m236	HUNTER	That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
L23253	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
L23252	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Boy, that's terrific.
L23251	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's over, Hunter.
L24089	u3584	m236	ROBY	Thanks for the thought. 
L24088	u3582	m236	HUNTER	If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
L24087	u3584	m236	ROBY	Is it armed?
L24086	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
L24083	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
L24082	u3584	m236	ROBY	"Isn't ""bait"" the word you used?"
L24076	u3584	m236	ROBY	I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
L24075	u3582	m236	HUNTER	This should do it.
L24054	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's not going to work.
L24053	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can use the flamethrower.
L24052	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
L24045	u3584	m236	ROBY	Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
L24044	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
L24041	u3584	m236	ROBY	And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
L24040	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Blow the ship up?
L24035	u3584	m236	ROBY	I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
L24034	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
L24011	u3584	m236	ROBY	You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
L24010	u3582	m236	HUNTER	... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
L24004	u3584	m236	ROBY	And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
L24003	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
L24002	u3584	m236	ROBY	In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
L24001	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Recognizable!  In that?
L23993	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We sure need this flamethrower.
L23992	u3584	m236	ROBY	Don't count on it.
L23975	u3584	m236	ROBY	It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
L23974	u3582	m236	HUNTER	You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
L23710	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
L23709	u3584	m236	ROBY	What common objects?
L23702	u3584	m236	ROBY	The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
L23701	u3582	m236	HUNTER	That must have been when he got it.
L23698	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey!  what about the film?
L23697	u3582	m236	HUNTER	This is horrible.
L23676	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think it's fizzled out.
L23675	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What's happening up here?
L23657	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
L23656	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
L23655	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh... God...
L23654	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
L23653	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What is it -- I can't tell anything --
L23652	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look at that.
L23643	u3584	m236	ROBY	I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
L23642	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
L23604	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
L23603	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh no.
L23598	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Three blips!  They're coming this way!
L23597	u3584	m236	ROBY	How many?
L23596	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
L23565	u3584	m236	ROBY	Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
L23564	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Why, you chickenshit bastard --
L23563	u3584	m236	ROBY	We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
L23562	u3582	m236	HUNTER	But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
L23561	u3584	m236	ROBY	We're not going anywhere.
L23560	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What do you mean, no?
L23559	u3584	m236	ROBY	No.
L23558	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
L23528	u3584	m236	ROBY	The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
L23527	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What?  What was that?
L23512	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'm trying.
L23511	u3584	m236	ROBY	Can you get them back?
L23510	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I've completely lost their signal.
L23509	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what's wrong?
L23956	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
L23955	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Okay.
L23954	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
L23953	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're getting pretty close now.
L23952	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's get moving with this net.
L23951	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're on the next level up.
L23950	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Are they close?
L23949	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
L23861	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
L23860	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
L23859	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
L23858	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
L23857	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
L23856	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
L23855	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's the one about the albatross, right?
L23854	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	"I was thinking of a line from an old poem: ""Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.""  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship."
L23853	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I thought I'd find you here.
L23848	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
L23847	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	And what do we do when we find it?
L23846	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Room by room, corridor by corridor.
L23845	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	How?
L23836	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got about a week left, right?
L23835	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
L23834	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
L23807	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Maybe we could write it together.
L23806	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The commander normally has first publication rights.
L23805	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	"I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it ""The Snark Log."""
L23800	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We're going into the freezers now.
L23799	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
L23758	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
L23757	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
L23708	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
L23707	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That sounds a little fanciful...
L23688	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It appears to have healed itself.
L23687	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Is it still dripping?
L23686	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, thank God... just missed him.
L23683	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
L23682	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
L23681	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Yes, thank heaven.
L23680	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's stopped?
L23634	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's let the machine work on him.
L23633	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
L23595	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
L23594	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What is it?
L23593	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It won't come -- it's stuck.
L23592	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
L23591	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Oh God, oh God no.
L23590	u3585	m236	STANDARD	<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
L23589	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	<u>What is it</u>?
L23584	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Can you see anything?
L23583	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, it's coming.
L23582	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
L23581	u3585	m236	STANDARD	There, it caught!
L23578	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
L23577	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
L23576	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
L23575	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
L23569	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Sun will be down in a minute.
L23568	u3585	m236	STANDARD	If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
L23557	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
L23556	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What'd he say?
L23514	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
L23513	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	This looks ancient.
L23497	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
L23496	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
L23431	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Who knows?
L23430	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Air lock?
L23421	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
L23420	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How far?
L23419	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's close, real close.
L23414	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	My signal's fading.
L23413	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's wrong?
L23408	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You lead.
L23407	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	That way.
L23403	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
L23402	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Receiving.
L23375	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
L23374	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
L23369	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
L23368	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
L23303	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell -- show me that on a screen.
L23302	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
L23300	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
L23299	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What's the frequency?
L23298	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
L23297	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	First contact...
L23263	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Feast your eyes.
L23262	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
L23810	u3584	m236	ROBY	Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
L23809	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
L23808	u3584	m236	ROBY	First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
L23756	u3584	m236	ROBY	Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
L23755	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
L23752	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
L23751	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah?
L23750	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We do know that.
L23745	u3584	m236	ROBY	About four hours.
L23744	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
L23696	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
L23695	u3584	m236	ROBY	That tube must be depositing it in him.
L23694	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
L23384	u3584	m236	ROBY	Close...
L23383	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
L23332	u3584	m236	ROBY	Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
L23331	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
L23325	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look --
L23324	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
L24113	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Kill me...
L24112	u3584	m236	ROBY	What can I do?
L24111	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No good... it's eaten too much of me...
L24110	u3584	m236	ROBY	But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
L24109	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No... don't...
L24108	u3584	m236	ROBY	I'll get you out of there.
L24107	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
L24106	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Look...
L24105	u3584	m236	ROBY	What did it do to you?
L24104	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Kill me...
L24093	u3584	m236	ROBY	Kablooey.
L24092	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
L24091	u3584	m236	ROBY	And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
L24090	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
L24085	u3584	m236	ROBY	Who gets the privilege?
L24084	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
L24068	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
L24067	u3584	m236	ROBY	So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
L24064	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
L24063	u3584	m236	ROBY	<u>Hey watch it</u>!
L24062	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Here, carry these.
L24061	u3584	m236	ROBY	You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
L24048	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
L24047	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah... I forgot.
L24046	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
L24043	u3584	m236	ROBY	Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
L24042	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
L24039	u3584	m236	ROBY	Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
L24038	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That'll blow the ship up.
L24037	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
L24036	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's hear it.
L24033	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
L24032	u3584	m236	ROBY	It was time for that a couple days ago.
L24027	u3584	m236	ROBY	No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
L24026	u3585	m236	STANDARD	At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
L24025	u3584	m236	ROBY	Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
L24024	u3584	m236	ROBY	No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
L24023	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can we get to him?
L24022	u3584	m236	ROBY	I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
L24013	u3584	m236	ROBY	... More spores coming.
L24012	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Which presumably means...
L24009	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
L24008	u3584	m236	ROBY	This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
L24006	u3584	m236	ROBY	So the next step should be --
L24005	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
L24000	u3584	m236	ROBY	I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
L23999	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
L23998	u3584	m236	ROBY	Can you make out any pattern in all that?
L23985	u3584	m236	ROBY	Nothing.
L23984	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's that supposed to mean?
L23983	u3584	m236	ROBY	Two down, four to go.
L23969	u3584	m236	ROBY	By eating our food supplies.
L23968	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How did it get so <u>big</u>?
L23948	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Right now let's keep it closed.
L23947	u3584	m236	ROBY	That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
L23938	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's be democratic.
L23937	u3584	m236	ROBY	So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
L23931	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
L23930	u3584	m236	ROBY	Are you <u>crazy</u>?
L23916	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What do you think?  Now we go in.
L23915	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what?
L23913	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Go ahead, Jay.
L23912	u3584	m236	ROBY	This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
L23909	u3584	m236	ROBY	You win.
L23908	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
L23907	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
L23900	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I guess we open the door and net it.
L23899	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what?
L23898	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
L23897	u3584	m236	ROBY	What's it doing, having a seizure?
L23895	u3584	m236	ROBY	We're coming!
L23894	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Food-storage room!
L23893	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where are you?
L23892	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
L23891	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yes!
L23870	u3584	m236	ROBY	Even simple.
L23869	u3585	m236	STANDARD	These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
L23841	u3584	m236	ROBY	But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
L23840	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
L23839	u3584	m236	ROBY	We won't need it then.
L23784	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
L23783	u3584	m236	ROBY	We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
L23782	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
L23781	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Quit complaining; we're in space.
L23780	u3584	m236	ROBY	That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
L23778	u3584	m236	ROBY	With great pleasure.
L23777	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
L23776	u3584	m236	ROBY	We made it!  Damn, we made it!
L23771	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's take her into an escape orbit.
L23770	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engaged.
L23767	u3584	m236	ROBY	Up one kilometer, Jay.
L23766	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Take us up.
L23754	u3585	m236	STANDARD	They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
L23753	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where did the parasites come from?
L23749	u3584	m236	ROBY	If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
L23748	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
L23747	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
L23746	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
L23728	u3584	m236	ROBY	Is that its mouth?
L23727	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
L23700	u3584	m236	ROBY	Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
L23699	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What film?
L23645	u3585	m236	STANDARD	He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
L23644	u3584	m236	ROBY	Would somebody fill me in?
L23638	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.
L23637	u3584	m236	ROBY	I understand why you did that.
L23620	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
L23619	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
L23618	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We can't leave him out here, open the door.
L23617	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
L23616	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
L23615	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
L23614	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
L23613	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
L23612	u3584	m236	ROBY	Here, Chaz.
L23602	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
L23601	u3584	m236	ROBY	Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
L23600	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
L23599	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey, can you guys hear me?
L23485	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
L23484	u3584	m236	ROBY	This ship is full of cat hair.
L23483	u3584	m236	ROBY	But why draw it on the wall?
L23482	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
L23481	u3584	m236	ROBY	What would you say that was supposed to mean?
L23480	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
L23479	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh well... you know me.
L23478	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Still worried?
L23477	u3584	m236	ROBY	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
L23476	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Find anything we missed?
L23458	u3584	m236	ROBY	What killed it?
L23457	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But?
L23456	u3584	m236	ROBY	I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
L23455	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin?
L23424	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
L23423	u3584	m236	ROBY	Found what?
L23422	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, uh, we've found it.
L23411	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
L23410	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
L23396	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
L23395	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
L23394	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Anything else?
L23393	u3584	m236	ROBY	Not a one.  It's dead.
L23392	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Any microorganisms?
L23391	u3584	m236	ROBY	Zero.  Dry as a bone.
L23390	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good!  Moisture content?
L23389	u3584	m236	ROBY	Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
L23388	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
L23387	u3584	m236	ROBY	10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
L23382	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
L23381	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, okay. 
L23353	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engine room, what happened?
L23352	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What the hell happened?
L23338	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Turn on navigation lights.
L23337	u3584	m236	ROBY	Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
L23330	u3584	m236	ROBY	No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
L23329	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's out of focus.
L23296	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, it's finally happened.
L23295	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh my God.
L23278	u3584	m236	ROBY	Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
L23277	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's hear it.
L23276	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
L23275	u3585	m236	STANDARD	This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
L23267	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, contact traffic control.
L23266	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where are we?
L23261	u3584	m236	ROBY	Right.  Fire up all systems.
L23260	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
L39304	u3655	m241	AMY	But you better hurry.
L39303	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Either way works for us...
L39084	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
L39083	u3655	m241	AMY	I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
L39021	u3655	m241	AMY	You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
L39020	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Merde! I can't believe this!
L39017	u3655	m241	AMY	Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
L39016	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Tell you what, we'll jump together.
L39015	u3655	m241	AMY	Would you shut up?
L39014	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Also like sex with my wife.
L39013	u3655	m241	AMY	The key is don't look down.
L39012	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Just like sex with my wife.
L39011	u3655	m241	AMY	Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
L38996	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
L38995	u3655	m241	AMY	Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
L38979	u3655	m241	AMY	Uhh! Would you die already!
L38978	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Merde! Just missed!
L38977	u3655	m241	AMY	Exactly.
L38976	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
L38973	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
L38972	u3655	m241	AMY	I'd use pills. They're painless.
L38971	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
L38987	u3655	m241	AMY	Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
L38986	u3656	m241	ANDY	Ha-ha!
L38983	u3655	m241	AMY	What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
L38982	u3656	m241	ANDY	Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
L38975	u3655	m241	AMY	Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
L38974	u3656	m241	ANDY	Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
L38962	u3656	m241	ANDY	Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
L38961	u3655	m241	AMY	A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
L38960	u3656	m241	ANDY	Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
L38955	u3656	m241	ANDY	No it isn't! You're dead!
L38954	u3655	m241	AMY	Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
L38948	u3656	m241	ANDY	Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
L38947	u3655	m241	AMY	Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
L38913	u3656	m241	ANDY	AHHHHHHH!
L38912	u3655	m241	AMY	Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
L38909	u3655	m241	AMY	I don't know... Surprise me.
L38908	u3656	m241	ANDY	Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
L38907	u3655	m241	AMY	Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
L38906	u3656	m241	ANDY	Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
L38905	u3655	m241	AMY	Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
L38904	u3656	m241	ANDY	Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
L38903	u3655	m241	AMY	Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
L38902	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah. Apparently.
L38901	u3655	m241	AMY	Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
L38890	u3656	m241	ANDY	It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
L38889	u3655	m241	AMY	God. How can you eat like that?
L38885	u3656	m241	ANDY	What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
L38884	u3655	m241	AMY	Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
L39299	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy...
L39298	u3656	m241	ANDY	Oh God. Shit...
L39281	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You too.
L39280	u3656	m241	ANDY	Okay. Be careful.
L39279	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
L39278	u3656	m241	ANDY	These tunnels must loop around and connect.
L39277	u3656	m241	ANDY	Right.
L39276	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Well, they are French.
L39275	u3656	m241	ANDY	Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
L39274	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
L39273	u3656	m241	ANDY	Whoa...
L39271	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead.
L39270	u3656	m241	ANDY	What does it say?
L39269	u3656	m241	ANDY	It's making me hungry.
L39268	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	What?
L39267	u3656	m241	ANDY	God. I can't believe it.
L39264	u3656	m241	ANDY	Really.
L39263	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	No wonder he let her go.
L39255	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
L39254	u3656	m241	ANDY	Didn't even have to ask.
L39245	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
L39244	u3656	m241	ANDY	Where?
L39243	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I know where he'll go.
L39242	u3656	m241	ANDY	No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
L39241	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
L39238	u3656	m241	ANDY	I couldn't do it. Not to you.
L39237	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	We don't both have to die.
L39233	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
L39232	u3656	m241	ANDY	What...?
L39231	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
L39230	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
L39229	u3656	m241	ANDY	What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
L39228	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
L39227	u3656	m241	ANDY	That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
L39226	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
L39225	u3656	m241	ANDY	It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
L39224	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
L39210	u3656	m241	ANDY	Fuck me...
L39209	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Holy mother of God...
L39202	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah. French fries...
L39201	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I hope they fucking fry us all.
L39177	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
L39176	u3656	m241	ANDY	What the fuck!? You too!?
L39143	u3656	m241	ANDY	Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
L39142	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Are you crazy!?
L39136	u3656	m241	ANDY	Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
L39135	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
L39134	u3656	m241	ANDY	I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
L39116	u3656	m241	ANDY	Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
L39115	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	They're coming!
L39107	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
L39106	u3656	m241	ANDY	Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
L39105	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I don't know...
L39104	u3656	m241	ANDY	I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
L39103	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	What makes you so sure this will work?
L39073	u3656	m241	ANDY	I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
L39072	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
L39068	u3656	m241	ANDY	A cure?
L39067	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Because, Andy. It's a cure.
L39063	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy! No!
L39062	u3656	m241	ANDY	You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
L39060	u3656	m241	ANDY	What?! He told you? When?
L39059	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I know. He told me.
L39058	u3656	m241	ANDY	I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
L38929	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
L38928	u3656	m241	ANDY	I don't... I... I can't remember...
L38927	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Where did you go last night? What did you do?
L38926	u3656	m241	ANDY	No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
L38925	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Are you okay?
L38924	u3656	m241	ANDY	Hello?
L38870	u3656	m241	ANDY	Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
L38869	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
L38868	u3656	m241	ANDY	Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
L38867	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I'll be right back. Stay put.
L38866	u3656	m241	ANDY	Serafine...
L38858	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
L38857	u3656	m241	ANDY	This looks familiar...
L38856	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	A la votre.
L38855	u3656	m241	ANDY	That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
L38854	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
L38853	u3656	m241	ANDY	Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
L38852	u3656	m241	ANDY	So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
L38851	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
L38849	u3656	m241	ANDY	Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
L38848	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Don't you want to change?
L38847	u3656	m241	ANDY	It's okay. I can see fine.
L38846	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	What about your glasses?
L38845	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
L38844	u3656	m241	ANDY	What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
L38842	u3656	m241	ANDY	I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
L38841	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
L38840	u3656	m241	ANDY	Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
L38838	u3656	m241	ANDY	Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
L38837	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Fan-fucking-tastic?
L38835	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	So... you feel okay now?
L38834	u3656	m241	ANDY	I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
L38833	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
L38831	u3656	m241	ANDY	Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
L38830	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	What happened? Did you cut yourself?
L38829	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
L38828	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
L38827	u3656	m241	ANDY	Serafine...?
L38826	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy! Holy shit!
L38768	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You must get out of here. It's not safe.
L38767	u3656	m241	ANDY	So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
L38766	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy!
L38765	u3656	m241	ANDY	Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
L38734	u3656	m241	ANDY	Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
L38733	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
L38732	u3656	m241	ANDY	"Come on. I'm from New York - the ""shoot me"" state. Don't wait up."
L38731	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
L38730	u3656	m241	ANDY	In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
L38729	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
L38727	u3656	m241	ANDY	And who's Claude?
L38726	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
L38725	u3656	m241	ANDY	Like an underground club?
L38724	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
L38723	u3656	m241	ANDY	Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
L38722	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Uh-huh. Good for you.
L38721	u3656	m241	ANDY	Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
L38720	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
L38719	u3656	m241	ANDY	Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
L38718	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
L38714	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
L38713	u3656	m241	ANDY	What?
L38712	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Salots! Shitfucker!
L38710	u3656	m241	ANDY	Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
L38709	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
L38708	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
L38707	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
L38706	u3656	m241	ANDY	Sure. I can follow that.
L38704	u3656	m241	ANDY	You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
L38703	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
L38702	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
L38701	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
L39316	u3659	m241	COP	Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
L39315	u3656	m241	ANDY	Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
L39314	u3659	m241	COP	It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
L39145	u3656	m241	ANDY	Shit!
L39144	u3659	m241	COP	Pull over! Now!
L38802	u3656	m241	ANDY	No... I...
L38801	u3659	m241	COP	You on drugs? Huh?
L38800	u3656	m241	ANDY	There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
L38798	u3656	m241	ANDY	It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
L38797	u3659	m241	COP	Okay, what the hell are you up to?
L38795	u3659	m241	COP	"Fuck? You think I don't know this word ""fuck""? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?"
L38794	u3656	m241	ANDY	GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
L38792	u3656	m241	ANDY	FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
L38791	u3659	m241	COP	Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
L39198	u3656	m241	ANDY	Looks like he lied to you too.
L39197	u3661	m241	GASTON	Nothing's happening!
L39186	u3661	m241	GASTON	Why isn't it doing anything!?
L39185	u3656	m241	ANDY	Ha. Some wonder drug...
L39168	u3661	m241	GASTON	Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
L39167	u3656	m241	ANDY	You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
L39163	u3656	m241	ANDY	Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
L39162	u3661	m241	GASTON	Another step and he's dead!
L39054	u3656	m241	ANDY	Sure. Don't you?
L39053	u3661	m241	GASTON	Do you think I'm an idiot?
L39049	u3656	m241	ANDY	Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
L39048	u3661	m241	GASTON	What's the problem?
L39046	u3661	m241	GASTON	If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
L39045	u3656	m241	ANDY	So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
L39042	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
L39041	u3661	m241	GASTON	The ADM. Let's go.
L39039	u3661	m241	GASTON	And you call me a moron...
L39038	u3656	m241	ANDY	Claude...?
L39037	u3661	m241	GASTON	What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
L39036	u3656	m241	ANDY	Bullshit! You're bluffing!
L39035	u3661	m241	GASTON	Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
L39033	u3656	m241	ANDY	You'll never get the chance.
L39032	u3661	m241	GASTON	No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
L39031	u3656	m241	ANDY	Or else what? You'll kill me?
L39030	u3661	m241	GASTON	Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
L39029	u3656	m241	ANDY	He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
L39028	u3661	m241	GASTON	Before the coma!
L39027	u3656	m241	ANDY	My uncle's in a coma you moron!
L39026	u3661	m241	GASTON	Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
L39025	u3656	m241	ANDY	Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
L39024	u3661	m241	GASTON	Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
L38781	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
L38780	u3661	m241	GASTON	In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
L39336	u3662	m241	LEDUC	My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
L39335	u3656	m241	ANDY	What about me?
L39334	u3662	m241	LEDUC	I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
L38946	u3662	m241	LEDUC	I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
L38945	u3656	m241	ANDY	But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
L38944	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
L38942	u3656	m241	ANDY	This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
L38941	u3662	m241	LEDUC	He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
L38940	u3656	m241	ANDY	Oh no... no....
L38939	u3662	m241	LEDUC	That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
L38938	u3656	m241	ANDY	Oh shit... No...
L38937	u3662	m241	LEDUC	We know you were with her.
L38933	u3656	m241	ANDY	What?!
L38932	u3662	m241	LEDUC	You recognize her?
L39212	u3656	m241	ANDY	You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
L39211	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
L39206	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	I told him it wasn't ready...
L39205	u3656	m241	ANDY	It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
L39101	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
L39100	u3656	m241	ANDY	Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
L39095	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
L39094	u3656	m241	ANDY	Because Gaston was after it.
L39093	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
L39092	u3656	m241	ANDY	Uncle Terrence.
L39091	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
L39090	u3656	m241	ANDY	Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
L39087	u3656	m241	ANDY	What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
L39086	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	I don't believe we've been introduced.
L39081	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
L39080	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed.  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
L39066	u3656	m241	ANDY	Why the fuck would I do that?
L39065	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
L38770	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
L38769	u3656	m241	ANDY	Not you too -
L38763	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
L38762	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
L38759	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
L38758	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah?
L38757	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	Andy...
L38756	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
L38755	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	"He's on a new drug called ZBH, or ""Daydream"". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time."
L38754	u3656	m241	ANDY	What?
L38753	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
L38752	u3656	m241	ANDY	Psychic awareness. Right.
L38750	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
L38749	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
L38748	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
L38746	u3656	m241	ANDY	I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
L38745	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
L39295	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
L39294	u3656	m241	ANDY	Claude.
L39293	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	"Yeah, I finally ""checked out"", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business."
L39292	u3656	m241	ANDY	Uncle Terrence, you're...
L39132	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
L39131	u3656	m241	ANDY	Where is it! Please!
L39130	u3656	m241	ANDY	The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
L39129	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
L39128	u3656	m241	ANDY	I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
L39127	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
L39126	u3656	m241	ANDY	Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
L39125	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
L39124	u3656	m241	ANDY	Sort of...
L39123	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
L39122	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
L39121	u3665	m241	TERRENCE	Andy? Andy is that you?
L39120	u3656	m241	ANDY	Uncle Terrence?
L39097	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
L39096	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
L39010	u3656	m241	ANDY	Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
L39009	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
L39008	u3656	m241	ANDY	Shit. I feel sick.
L38999	u3663	m241	MARCEL	But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
L38998	u3656	m241	ANDY	What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
L38990	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
L38989	u3656	m241	ANDY	Alright. Let me write a letter.
L38981	u3663	m241	MARCEL	No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
L38980	u3656	m241	ANDY	Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
L38958	u3663	m241	MARCEL	What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
L38957	u3656	m241	ANDY	Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
L38956	u3663	m241	MARCEL	I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
L38695	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
L38694	u3656	m241	ANDY	Not that I know.
L38693	u3663	m241	MARCEL	I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
L38692	u3656	m241	ANDY	Why would he pick this one?
L38691	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
L38690	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
L38687	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
L38686	u3656	m241	ANDY	I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
L38685	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
L38684	u3656	m241	ANDY	Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
L38683	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
L38682	u3656	m241	ANDY	What do you mean, maniacs?
L38681	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
L38680	u3656	m241	ANDY	Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
L38679	u3663	m241	MARCEL	No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
L38678	u3656	m241	ANDY	"Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his ""hippie brother"". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?"
L38677	u3663	m241	MARCEL	How well did, er, do you know him?
L38676	u3656	m241	ANDY	Jesus...
L38672	u3656	m241	ANDY	Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
L38671	u3663	m241	MARCEL	He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
L38669	u3656	m241	ANDY	That's McDermott, but yeah.
L38668	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
L38968	u3657	m241	CHIEF	Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
L38967	u3662	m241	LEDUC	I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
L38966	u3657	m241	CHIEF	Enough. Cut him loose.
L38953	u3662	m241	LEDUC	I told you. These murders are not normal.
L38952	u3657	m241	CHIEF	Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
L38951	u3662	m241	LEDUC	I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
L38950	u3657	m241	CHIEF	Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
L39171	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	"Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite ""intense"". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. ""The great cure for lycanthropy!"" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha."
L39170	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	You fucking liar!
L39169	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
L38877	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
L38876	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
L38875	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
L38874	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy!
L38872	u3658	m241	CLAUDE	Allo?
L38871	u3664	m241	SERAFINE	Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
L39290	u3660	m241	DESK OFFICER	Yes sir.
L39289	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Now!
L39288	u3660	m241	DESK OFFICER	But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
L39287	u3662	m241	LEDUC	I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
L39286	u3660	m241	DESK OFFICER	Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
L39285	u3662	m241	LEDUC	What did she say?
L39284	u3660	m241	DESK OFFICER	Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
L39283	u3662	m241	LEDUC	What've you got?
L38822	u3662	m241	LEDUC	What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
L38821	u3663	m241	MARCEL	You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
L38820	u3662	m241	LEDUC	You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
L38819	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Saint Severin...
L38817	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
L38816	u3662	m241	LEDUC	You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
L38815	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Double merde.
L38814	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
L38813	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Merde.
L38812	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
L38811	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
L38810	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Okay. So maybe you were right.
L38809	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Well?
L38689	u3663	m241	MARCEL	Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
L38688	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Here.
L38674	u3663	m241	MARCEL	He says -
L38673	u3662	m241	LEDUC	Merde.
L90110	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I want to see the sun rise.
L90109	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you want me to do?
L90106	u4071	m271	BLADE	Not good.
L90105	u4076	m271	NYSSA	How does it look?
L90012	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I don't understand.
L90011	u4071	m271	BLADE	"It means ""bloodbrother."""
L90003	u4071	m271	BLADE	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
L90002	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're hurting me.
L90000	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
L89999	u4071	m271	BLADE	I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
L89998	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Why do you hate us so much?
L89997	u4076	m271	NYSSA	If that's true, then why'd you save me?
L89996	u4071	m271	BLADE	Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
L89995	u4076	m271	NYSSA	It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
L89994	u4071	m271	BLADE	Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
L89993	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Why?
L89992	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't want to go there.
L89991	u4071	m271	BLADE	I wouldn't read too much into it.
L89990	u4076	m271	NYSSA	It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
L89989	u4071	m271	BLADE	For what?
L89988	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Thank you.
L89987	u4071	m271	BLADE	I don't think so.
L89986	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Anyone else make it?
L89985	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.
L89984	u4071	m271	BLADE	What?
L89983	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Each day is a little life.
L89974	u4071	m271	BLADE	Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
L89973	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Blade.
L89952	u4071	m271	BLADE	Fry 'em.
L89951	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
L89909	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
L89908	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't have to hunt to do it.
L89907	u4076	m271	NYSSA	He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
L89871	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
L89870	u4071	m271	BLADE	Like cancer with a purpose.
L89869	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
L89864	u4071	m271	BLADE	Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
L89863	u4076	m271	NYSSA	If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
L89862	u4071	m271	BLADE	No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
L89861	u4071	m271	BLADE	Time.
L89860	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
L89859	u4071	m271	BLADE	Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
L89858	u4076	m271	NYSSA	From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
L89857	u4071	m271	BLADE	Recognize him?
L89826	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Minutes.
L89825	u4071	m271	BLADE	how long since he was bitten?
L89821	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I didn't know.
L89820	u4071	m271	BLADE	He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
L89819	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What about Nomak?
L89818	u4071	m271	BLADE	I'll heal.
L89817	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're hurt.
L89804	u4071	m271	BLADE	Nothing.
L89803	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What was that?
L89796	u4076	m271	NYSSA	We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
L89795	u4071	m271	BLADE	What is it with you people and pain?
L89791	u4071	m271	BLADE	I haven't forgotten.
L89790	u4076	m271	NYSSA	This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
L89778	u4076	m271	NYSSA	The House of Pain.
L89777	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where to first?
L89759	u4071	m271	BLADE	We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
L89758	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What the hell are you doing, Blade?
L89757	u4071	m271	BLADE	You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
L89743	u4076	m271	NYSSA	No.  They've been training to hunt you.
L89742	u4071	m271	BLADE	"Then they weren't created to go after your ""patient zero""."
L89741	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Two years.
L89736	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
L89735	u4071	m271	BLADE	Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
L89730	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Survival.
L89729	u4071	m271	BLADE	Why?
L89712	u4076	m271	NYSSA	They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
L89711	u4071	m271	BLADE	What?
L90089	u4071	m271	BLADE	Blood...
L90088	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
L90021	u4071	m271	BLADE	Then who does he work for?
L90020	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
L90019	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
L90018	u4071	m271	BLADE	What's your problem, Whistler?
L90016	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Just out connecting a few dots.
L90015	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where the hell have you been?
L90014	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Your security's for shit, kid.
L89939	u4071	m271	BLADE	We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
L89938	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
L89892	u4071	m271	BLADE	It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
L89891	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
L89890	u4071	m271	BLADE	Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
L89889	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
L89888	u4071	m271	BLADE	I wouldn't worry about it.
L89887	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
L89841	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I'll show you.
L89840	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where were you, Whistler?
L89835	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
L89834	u4071	m271	BLADE	I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
L89787	u4071	m271	BLADE	I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
L89786	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I don't like it.
L89785	u4071	m271	BLADE	He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
L89747	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
L89746	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you really think?
L89745	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Sounds like a plan.
L89744	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you think?
L89709	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Either that or feeding the worms.
L89708	u4071	m271	BLADE	I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
L89675	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
L89674	u4071	m271	BLADE	Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
L89673	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Took you long enough.
L89672	u4071	m271	BLADE	Did you think I wouldn't?
L89671	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You came back for me.
L89670	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
L89669	u4071	m271	BLADE	How do you feel?
L90043	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
L90042	u4071	m271	BLADE	Thought you were dead.
L90041	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Put it back in park, Blade.
L89947	u4071	m271	BLADE	So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
L89946	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	So?
L89945	u4071	m271	BLADE	Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
L89882	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
L89881	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
L89880	u4071	m271	BLADE	Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
L89879	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	And so will we.
L90080	u4071	m271	BLADE	Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
L90079	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	And why is that?
L90078	u4071	m271	BLADE	Too bad you're out of it.
L90077	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
L90037	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	I should think that would be obvious at this point.
L90036	u4071	m271	BLADE	The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
L89738	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Not alone.
L89737	u4071	m271	BLADE	You want me to hunt them for you.
L89722	u4071	m271	BLADE	For what?
L89721	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
L90058	u4071	m271	BLADE	Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
L90057	u4078	m271	SCUD	So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
L90047	u4078	m271	SCUD	You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
L90046	u4071	m271	BLADE	Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
L90008	u4071	m271	BLADE	He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
L90007	u4078	m271	SCUD	Nomak?
L90006	u4071	m271	BLADE	He was here.  Watching us.
L90005	u4078	m271	SCUD	What's going on?
L89749	u4071	m271	BLADE	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
L89748	u4078	m271	SCUD	So you're going to do this?
L89693	u4071	m271	BLADE	Human?
L89692	u4078	m271	SCUD	Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
L89664	u4078	m271	SCUD	I don't know about this, man --
L89663	u4071	m271	BLADE	Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
L89662	u4071	m271	BLADE	Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
L89661	u4078	m271	SCUD	You got something in mind, Blade?
L89950	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
L89949	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What the fuck you doing?
L89942	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
L89941	u4072	m271	CHUPA	We want to attract them, not scare them off.
L89839	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
L89838	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
L89837	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
L89836	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
L89770	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
L89769	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Getting your attention, Paco.
L89768	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
L90097	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Maybe it's better that way.
L90096	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
L90095	u4076	m271	NYSSA	We're locked in.
L90072	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You experimented on your own, son?
L90071	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	From his father, of course.
L90070	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
L90069	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
L89734	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
L89733	u4076	m271	NYSSA	His name is Jared Nomak.
L89854	u4079	m271	STEVENS	As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
L89853	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
L89851	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
L89850	u4079	m271	STEVENS	No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
L89849	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
L89848	u4079	m271	STEVENS	Two so far.
L89847	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Any casualties?
L89846	u4079	m271	STEVENS	They've made contact with the Reapers.
L89845	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Yes?
L89643	u4074	m271	NOMAK	Us?  What are you talking about?
L89642	u4075	m271	NURSE	Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
L89640	u4075	m271	NURSE	It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
L89639	u4074	m271	NOMAK	No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
L89638	u4075	m271	NURSE	Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
L89637	u4074	m271	NOMAK	Not that I'm in contact with.
L89636	u4075	m271	NURSE	I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
L90054	u4078	m271	SCUD	Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
L90053	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You little shit.  When did they get to you?
L90052	u4078	m271	SCUD	Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
L89929	u4078	m271	SCUD	After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
L89928	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What about you?  You're not coming?
L89921	u4078	m271	SCUD	"I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take ""E"", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, ""Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"""
L89920	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Pretty.
L89919	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
L89918	u4078	m271	SCUD	Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
L89917	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Going on twenty years now.
L89916	u4078	m271	SCUD	So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
L89915	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Nope.  Back then we did not.
L89914	u4078	m271	SCUD	Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
L89913	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You're wasting your time, already been tried.
L89912	u4078	m271	SCUD	Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
L89911	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	The hell are you fiddling with there?
L89707	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
L89706	u4078	m271	SCUD	This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
L89691	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
L89690	u4078	m271	SCUD	Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
L89688	u4078	m271	SCUD	Look, what's your problem?
L89687	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
L89686	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
L89685	u4078	m271	SCUD	Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
L89684	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
L89683	u4078	m271	SCUD	The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
L89682	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
L89681	u4078	m271	SCUD	Scud.
L89680	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Tell me something, Skid --
L89499	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
L89498	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler, I --
L89494	u4081	m272	BLADE	No, we can treat the wounds --
L89493	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
L89492	u4081	m272	BLADE	Don't try to talk --
L89391	u4081	m272	BLADE	China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
L89390	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Going somewhere?
L89345	u4081	m272	BLADE	Don't even start, old man.
L89344	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	What took you so long?
L89183	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Wait.
L89182	u4081	m272	BLADE	Get in. You?re leaving.
L89164	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
L89163	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
L89162	u4081	m272	BLADE	Stupidity.
L89151	u4081	m272	BLADE	Just do it, old man.
L89150	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
L89126	u4081	m272	BLADE	She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
L89125	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You should've killed her, then.
L89124	u4081	m272	BLADE	She's been bitten.
L89123	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Are we bringing home strays now?
L89122	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler!
L89628	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's because I'm human that I can do this.
L89627	u4084	m272	FROST	You're too human, Blade.
L89625	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
L89624	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
L89623	u4081	m272	BLADE	Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
L89608	u4084	m272	FROST	Take him.
L89607	u4081	m272	BLADE	Who dies first?
L89606	u4081	m272	BLADE	Frost!!!
L89605	u4084	m272	FROST	No longer.
L89437	u4084	m272	FROST	Watch me.
L89436	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're not going anywhere.
L89432	u4084	m272	FROST	You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
L89431	u4081	m272	BLADE	Pass.
L89430	u4084	m272	FROST	The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
L89428	u4084	m272	FROST	Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
L89427	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're wrong.
L89426	u4084	m272	FROST	Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
L89425	u4081	m272	BLADE	Maybe I don't see it that way.
L89424	u4084	m272	FROST	Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
L89423	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't buy it.
L89422	u4084	m272	FROST	"It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, ""the Day-walker""."
L89421	u4084	m272	FROST	I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
L89420	u4081	m272	BLADE	How can you be out here?
L89419	u4084	m272	FROST	Beautiful day, isn't it?
L89488	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	You've been here longer than you think.
L89487	u4081	m272	BLADE	But I just got here --
L89486	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	I am tired. Dawn is coming.
L89484	u4081	m272	BLADE	How do I stop it?
L89483	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
L89482	u4081	m272	BLADE	The Blood Tide.
L89481	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	"The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  ""And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."""
L89478	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
L89477	u4081	m272	BLADE	Who is LaMagra?
L89476	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
L89474	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Show me.
L89473	u4081	m272	BLADE	I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
L89472	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Hold out your hands.
L89470	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	There are other ways to see. Sit.
L89469	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're blind --
L89468	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Is something wrong, my friend?
L89631	u4081	m272	BLADE	For them. But for me --
L89630	u4086	m272	KAREN	I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
L89598	u4086	m272	KAREN	Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
L89597	u4081	m272	BLADE	I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
L89596	u4086	m272	KAREN	It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
L89595	u4081	m272	BLADE	No --
L89594	u4086	m272	KAREN	I know. Take some of my blood.
L89593	u4081	m272	BLADE	-- tearing me -- apart.
L89592	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't understand. The Thirst --
L89591	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm not leaving without you.
L89590	u4081	m272	BLADE	Get out of here --
L89544	u4081	m272	BLADE	What are you talking about?
L89543	u4086	m272	KAREN	It won't work on you.
L89542	u4081	m272	BLADE	We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
L89541	u4086	m272	KAREN	Is it bad?
L89540	u4086	m272	KAREN	I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
L89539	u4081	m272	BLADE	How long have we been driving?
L89538	u4081	m272	BLADE	I've been better --
L89537	u4086	m272	KAREN	Are you all right?
L89447	u4086	m272	KAREN	You make it sound like I'm already dead.
L89446	u4081	m272	BLADE	For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
L89442	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
L89441	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't look so good.
L89440	u4086	m272	KAREN	Some. It's been slow --
L89439	u4081	m272	BLADE	Any progress?
L89403	u4081	m272	BLADE	Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
L89402	u4086	m272	KAREN	My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
L89401	u4081	m272	BLADE	We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
L89400	u4086	m272	KAREN	You care about him, don't you?
L89399	u4081	m272	BLADE	Cancer.
L89398	u4086	m272	KAREN	Is he sick?
L89393	u4081	m272	BLADE	For your miracle cure?
L89392	u4086	m272	KAREN	I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
L89380	u4086	m272	KAREN	Blade --
L89379	u4081	m272	BLADE	Just get out of here.
L89378	u4086	m272	KAREN	If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
L89377	u4081	m272	BLADE	I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
L89376	u4086	m272	KAREN	Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
L89375	u4081	m272	BLADE	I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
L89373	u4081	m272	BLADE	You get used to the darkness.
L89372	u4086	m272	KAREN	It's dark in here.
L89341	u4081	m272	BLADE	Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
L89340	u4086	m272	KAREN	What am I injecting you with?
L89338	u4081	m272	BLADE	Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
L89337	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're hurt --
L89295	u4081	m272	BLADE	You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
L89294	u4086	m272	KAREN	Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
L89293	u4081	m272	BLADE	Some kind of archive --
L89292	u4086	m272	KAREN	What is this place?
L89284	u4081	m272	BLADE	Like me.
L89283	u4086	m272	KAREN	Like what?
L89282	u4081	m272	BLADE	There are worse things than vampires out there.
L89281	u4086	m272	KAREN	So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
L89279	u4081	m272	BLADE	The way they move, they way they smell --
L89278	u4086	m272	KAREN	How can you tell?
L89277	u4081	m272	BLADE	Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
L89270	u4081	m272	BLADE	He will.
L89269	u4086	m272	KAREN	You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
L89255	u4081	m272	BLADE	Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
L89254	u4086	m272	KAREN	I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
L89252	u4081	m272	BLADE	Look closer.
L89251	u4086	m272	KAREN	Graffiti --
L89250	u4081	m272	BLADE	What do you see here?
L89249	u4086	m272	KAREN	What are you looking at?
L89248	u4086	m272	KAREN	You don't know that.
L89247	u4081	m272	BLADE	There is no cure.
L89246	u4086	m272	KAREN	Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
L89231	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
L89230	u4086	m272	KAREN	You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
L89229	u4081	m272	BLADE	Preventive medicine.
L89228	u4086	m272	KAREN	What are you doing?!
L89223	u4081	m272	BLADE	For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
L89222	u4086	m272	KAREN	And that's a good thing?
L89221	u4081	m272	BLADE	Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
L89220	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
L89219	u4081	m272	BLADE	That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
L89218	u4081	m272	BLADE	He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
L89217	u4086	m272	KAREN	But he's a policeman --
L89216	u4081	m272	BLADE	He didn't. Get over it.
L89215	u4086	m272	KAREN	But, he could've --
L89214	u4081	m272	BLADE	It worked, didn't it?
L89213	u4086	m272	KAREN	You used me as bait?!
L89212	u4081	m272	BLADE	Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
L89211	u4086	m272	KAREN	How did you know?
L89180	u4086	m272	KAREN	That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
L89179	u4081	m272	BLADE	Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
L89178	u4086	m272	KAREN	I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
L89176	u4081	m272	BLADE	Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
L89175	u4086	m272	KAREN	I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
L89174	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
L89173	u4086	m272	KAREN	And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
L89167	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens then?
L89166	u4081	m272	BLADE	Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
L89165	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why?
L89158	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're joking --
L89157	u4081	m272	BLADE	-- he's a vampire.
L89153	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm sorry, I --
L89152	u4081	m272	BLADE	You shouldn't be here.
L89411	u4085	m272	KAM	There's only one alternative to the serum.
L89410	u4081	m272	BLADE	Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
L89409	u4085	m272	KAM	I was afraid that might happen.
L89408	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
L89407	u4081	m272	BLADE	I was in the neighborhood.
L89406	u4085	m272	KAM	You're a week early.
L89405	u4081	m272	BLADE	How's it going, Kam?
L89576	u4088	m272	VANESSA	You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
L89575	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't believe that.
L89574	u4088	m272	VANESSA	I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
L89573	u4088	m272	VANESSA	You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
L89572	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't have to be.
L89571	u4088	m272	VANESSA	These are my people now. I'm one of them.
L89570	u4081	m272	BLADE	How could you be a part of this?
L89534	u4088	m272	VANESSA	Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
L89533	u4081	m272	BLADE	Please --
L89529	u4081	m272	BLADE	Fight him --
L89528	u4088	m272	VANESSA	Deacon brought me back.
L89527	u4081	m272	BLADE	But you -- died --
L89116	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
L89115	u4086	m272	KAREN	-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
L89114	u4086	m272	KAREN	Sometimes --
L89113	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
L89112	u4082	m272	CURTIS	He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
L89111	u4086	m272	KAREN	What?
L89110	u4082	m272	CURTIS	That's weird --
L89109	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
L89108	u4086	m272	KAREN	You haven't started in on the internal organs?
L89107	u4082	m272	CURTIS	No problem.
L89106	u4086	m272	KAREN	"Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about ""us""."
L89105	u4082	m272	CURTIS	This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
L89104	u4086	m272	KAREN	I thought you promised to give me some distance?
L89103	u4082	m272	CURTIS	It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
L89102	u4086	m272	KAREN	Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
L89100	u4082	m272	CURTIS	What about the chemistry panel?
L89099	u4086	m272	KAREN	The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
L89098	u4086	m272	KAREN	I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
L89097	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Then what is it?
L89096	u4086	m272	KAREN	This isn't human blood.
L89386	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	The other elders will never let you get away with this!
L89385	u4084	m272	FROST	How do you like that? Right on time.
L89191	u4084	m272	FROST	Perhaps.
L89190	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
L89189	u4084	m272	FROST	Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
L89188	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
L89146	u4084	m272	FROST	Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
L89145	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
L89141	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	He is an abomination!
L89140	u4084	m272	FROST	Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
L89139	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	"I see. And what would you have us do with this ""half-breed""?"
L89138	u4084	m272	FROST	Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
L89137	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
L89136	u4084	m272	FROST	The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
L89135	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wrong, Dragonetti.
L89134	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
L89621	u4086	m272	KAREN	Get away from him!
L89620	u4084	m272	FROST	I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
L89554	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
L89553	u4086	m272	KAREN	Blade --
L89520	u4084	m272	FROST	Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
L89519	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're a monster.
L89517	u4084	m272	FROST	Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
L89516	u4086	m272	KAREN	But you use blood banks --
L89515	u4084	m272	FROST	What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
L89514	u4086	m272	KAREN	There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
L89513	u4084	m272	FROST	Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
L89512	u4086	m272	KAREN	You.
L89511	u4084	m272	FROST	LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
L89510	u4084	m272	FROST	That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
L89509	u4086	m272	KAREN	LaMagra --
L89508	u4084	m272	FROST	The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
L89507	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens then?
L89506	u4084	m272	FROST	A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
L89505	u4086	m272	KAREN	How many of you are there?
L89462	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
L89461	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happened to the power?
L89460	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
L89459	u4086	m272	KAREN	On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
L89457	u4086	m272	KAREN	With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
L89456	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	How?
L89455	u4086	m272	KAREN	Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
L89453	u4086	m272	KAREN	Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
L89452	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
L89451	u4086	m272	KAREN	All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
L89370	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'll take my chances.
L89369	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
L89368	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
L89367	u4086	m272	KAREN	And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
L89366	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
L89365	u4086	m272	KAREN	How did you escape?
L89364	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
L89363	u4086	m272	KAREN	He killed them?
L89362	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
L89361	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Habit, mostly, just like this.
L89360	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why do you hunt them?
L89358	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
L89357	u4086	m272	KAREN	No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
L89356	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
L89355	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
L89354	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
L89347	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	We weren't sure we could trust you.
L89346	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
L89335	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Go on, I'll be fine!
L89334	u4086	m272	KAREN	Whistler!
L89332	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
L89331	u4086	m272	KAREN	You've been listening in the whole time?
L89330	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	We keep in radio contact.
L89186	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
L89185	u4086	m272	KAREN	So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
L89184	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
L89171	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
L89170	u4086	m272	KAREN	So what do you use, then? A stake?
L89156	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
L89155	u4086	m272	KAREN	Who are you people?
L89131	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
L89130	u4086	m272	KAREN	What -- ?
L92345	u4090	m273	ANNA	Nick!!
L92344	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Bullshit! Talk!
L92343	u4090	m273	ANNA	Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
L92341	u4090	m273	ANNA	--my God, Nick???
L92340	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
L92333	u4090	m273	ANNA	I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
L92332	u4093	m273	HEATHER	You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
L92307	u4090	m273	ANNA	Closer.
L92306	u4093	m273	HEATHER	No.
L92305	u4090	m273	ANNA	Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
L92304	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Not that I can see.
L92303	u4090	m273	ANNA	My eye, is there something in my eye?
L92302	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What, are you alright?
L92301	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--Anna--
L92300	u4090	m273	ANNA	Don't know--just that she was afraid--
L92299	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What happened to her, where did she go?
L92298	u4090	m273	ANNA	A coward too. That's why she had to go.
L92297	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What do you mean?
L92296	u4090	m273	ANNA	--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
L92295	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Try, please, Anna--
L92294	u4090	m273	ANNA	I don't...I don't understand them myself.
L92293	u4093	m273	HEATHER	I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
L91862	u4090	m273	ANNA	Join the club.
L91861	u4093	m273	HEATHER	'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
L91744	u4090	m273	ANNA	Because it means the tree is older than the house.
L91743	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
L91698	u4090	m273	ANNA	Hey, folklore--
L91697	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--or incredibly fucking naive.
L91594	u4090	m273	ANNA	--which she may have--
L91593	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--and if she ever did--
L91851	u4090	m273	ANNA	I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
L91850	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
L91685	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Sometimes. Where are we going?
L91684	u4090	m273	ANNA	Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
L91674	u4092	m273	DOMINI	To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
L91673	u4090	m273	ANNA	Inside the grave?
L91672	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Trying to find the energy.
L91671	u4090	m273	ANNA	What're you doing there?
L91670	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Yes.
L91669	u4090	m273	ANNA	Domini?
L91969	u4090	m273	ANNA	--he's not my husband!
L91968	u4094	m273	INTERN	Let's talk to your husband--
L91967	u4090	m273	ANNA	--I'm not staying here!
L91966	u4094	m273	INTERN	Mrs. Leavitt--
L91965	u4090	m273	ANNA	No!
L91964	u4090	m273	ANNA	I guess--
L91963	u4094	m273	INTERN	Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
L91962	u4090	m273	ANNA	Something was wrong.
L91961	u4094	m273	INTERN	--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
L91960	u4090	m273	ANNA	I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
L91959	u4094	m273	INTERN	Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
L91958	u4090	m273	ANNA	Why?
L92349	u4090	m273	ANNA	--Nick!!
L92348	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
L92339	u4090	m273	ANNA	I haven't killed any--
L92338	u4091	m273	COTTER	--the witch kills children--
L91939	u4091	m273	COTTER	There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
L91938	u4090	m273	ANNA	Looks like business is booming.
L91918	u4091	m273	COTTER	That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
L91917	u4090	m273	ANNA	That's a joke?
L91916	u4091	m273	COTTER	Druid Hill Park.
L91906	u4090	m273	ANNA	We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
L91905	u4091	m273	COTTER	You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
L91904	u4090	m273	ANNA	Oh, sorry, right.
L91903	u4091	m273	COTTER	--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
L91879	u4090	m273	ANNA	Not the only things missing, Nick.
L91878	u4091	m273	COTTER	This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
L91746	u4090	m273	ANNA	So whoever built this--
L91745	u4091	m273	COTTER	Yeah, so?
L91736	u4090	m273	ANNA	No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
L91735	u4091	m273	COTTER	Oak?
L91723	u4090	m273	ANNA	Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
L91722	u4091	m273	COTTER	Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
L91689	u4090	m273	ANNA	The Witch's voice.
L91688	u4091	m273	COTTER	The Voiiiiices made him do it.
L91643	u4091	m273	COTTER	Then there she blows.
L91642	u4090	m273	ANNA	I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
L91641	u4091	m273	COTTER	--how old?
L91638	u4090	m273	ANNA	No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
L91637	u4091	m273	COTTER	What's she look like?
L91634	u4091	m273	COTTER	Who?
L91633	u4090	m273	ANNA	She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
L91632	u4091	m273	COTTER	Why are we here?
L91627	u4091	m273	COTTER	Think again.
L91626	u4090	m273	ANNA	Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
L91625	u4091	m273	COTTER	'Thought those all got stolen.
L91584	u4091	m273	COTTER	--a six week bun in the oven--
L91583	u4090	m273	ANNA	"--it's called ""morning sickness,"" asshole--"
L91582	u4091	m273	COTTER	--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
L91581	u4090	m273	ANNA	--Christ almighty--
L91580	u4091	m273	COTTER	The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
L91576	u4090	m273	ANNA	Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
L91575	u4091	m273	COTTER	"Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the ""feeling."""
L91574	u4091	m273	COTTER	Christ.
L91573	u4090	m273	ANNA	Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
L91572	u4091	m273	COTTER	"Shit? This is from ""Josh's Blair Witch Mix,"" man!"
L92353	u4090	m273	ANNA	--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
L92352	u4096	m273	NICK	Oh, Jesus, no--
L92337	u4090	m273	ANNA	--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
L92336	u4096	m273	NICK	--like you hurt the baby--
L92331	u4096	m273	NICK	I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
L92330	u4090	m273	ANNA	Why?
L92329	u4096	m273	NICK	Are you marked like this??
L92328	u4090	m273	ANNA	--no, what's wrong with you?
L92327	u4096	m273	NICK	The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
L92326	u4090	m273	ANNA	Whatever you want.
L92325	u4096	m273	NICK	I want to see something!
L92168	u4090	m273	ANNA	--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
L92167	u4096	m273	NICK	Then I'm going--
L92166	u4090	m273	ANNA	I can't.
L92165	u4096	m273	NICK	I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
L92012	u4096	m273	NICK	Here.
L92011	u4090	m273	ANNA	Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
L92010	u4096	m273	NICK	What'd you dream?
L92009	u4090	m273	ANNA	I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
L92008	u4096	m273	NICK	Just...try and go back to sleep.
L92007	u4090	m273	ANNA	No.

L91947	u4090	m273	ANNA	I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
L91946	u4096	m273	NICK	We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
L91945	u4090	m273	ANNA	For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
L91942	u4090	m273	ANNA	We've looked at half of one tape.
L91941	u4096	m273	NICK	I think we get the gist.
L91902	u4090	m273	ANNA	No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
L91901	u4096	m273	NICK	And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
L91900	u4090	m273	ANNA	I want to see the tapes.

L91765	u4090	m273	ANNA	You feel no need to get married or anything.

L91763	u4090	m273	ANNA	"Why is there no ""our"" here?"
L91762	u4096	m273	NICK	Your body, your call.

L91760	u4096	m273	NICK	Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
L91759	u4090	m273	ANNA	Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
L91758	u4096	m273	NICK	Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
L91757	u4090	m273	ANNA	You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
L91756	u4096	m273	NICK	No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
L91755	u4090	m273	ANNA	It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
L91754	u4096	m273	NICK	Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
L91751	u4096	m273	NICK	No--<u>this</u> is weird.
L91750	u4090	m273	ANNA	Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.

L91742	u4096	m273	NICK	Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
L91741	u4090	m273	ANNA	--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
L91740	u4096	m273	NICK	It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
L91739	u4090	m273	ANNA	That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
L91734	u4090	m273	ANNA	What is <u>this</u>?
L91733	u4096	m273	NICK	--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.

L91712	u4096	m273	NICK	No.

L91700	u4090	m273	ANNA	--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--

L91651	u4096	m273	NICK	--whatever; that's her.

L92075	u4091	m273	COTTER	The witch?
L92064	u4091	m273	COTTER	Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
L92063	u4092	m273	DOMINI	So lemme see it.
L92035	u4091	m273	COTTER	Four in the morning?
L92034	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--go!
L92033	u4091	m273	COTTER	I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
L92032	u4092	m273	DOMINI	If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
L92031	u4091	m273	COTTER	Can't you like just divine it?
L92028	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
L92027	u4091	m273	COTTER	I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
L92026	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
L92025	u4091	m273	COTTER	Okay, a blur.
L92018	u4091	m273	COTTER	Fine.

L92016	u4091	m273	COTTER	There, what? I didn't see anything.
L91993	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
L91992	u4091	m273	COTTER	Does it hurt?
L91987	u4091	m273	COTTER	Fine.
L91986	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Turn the tapes back on.
L91985	u4091	m273	COTTER	This is a little nuts.
L91981	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Something. Someone.
L91980	u4091	m273	COTTER	What? That made her lose the baby?
L91979	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.

L91896	u4092	m273	DOMINI	I don't know yet.
L91895	u4091	m273	COTTER	Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
L91894	u4092	m273	DOMINI	I don't think it was them.
L91890	u4092	m273	DOMINI	No.
L91889	u4091	m273	COTTER	My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
L91888	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
L91887	u4091	m273	COTTER	How'd you know they were--
L91883	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--no, I think they're all in there.
L91882	u4091	m273	COTTER	<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
L91874	u4091	m273	COTTER	--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
L91873	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
L91683	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Sometimes.
L91682	u4091	m273	COTTER	So, I hear you're from New Mexico!

L91677	u4091	m273	COTTER	Beer and weed is what I've got.

L91675	u4091	m273	COTTER	You want a hand?
L92309	u4091	m273	COTTER	Anna's the witch.
L92308	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
L92286	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
L92285	u4091	m273	COTTER	--who?
L92284	u4093	m273	HEATHER	"--it's the ""Blair Witch Cult""--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--"
L92276	u4091	m273	COTTER	--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
L92275	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
L92274	u4091	m273	COTTER	--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
L92260	u4091	m273	COTTER	No one ever comes here.
L92259	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Who?
L92255	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Goes right along with these two.
L92254	u4091	m273	COTTER	"For ""James?"""
L92253	u4093	m273	HEATHER	"That's a ""j."""
L92228	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
L92227	u4091	m273	COTTER	--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
L92226	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Nobody's going anywhere--
L92217	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--before you lose your emotional lunch.
L92216	u4091	m273	COTTER	I'd strongly advise you to join us--
L92201	u4093	m273	HEATHER	<u>What</u>--
L92200	u4091	m273	COTTER	Be it still alive, James?
L92198	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--Domini!
L92197	u4091	m273	COTTER	--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
L92196	u4093	m273	HEATHER	The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
L92195	u4091	m273	COTTER	Yeah. Me too.
L92194	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--I saw what I saw.
L92193	u4091	m273	COTTER	The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
L92192	u4091	m273	COTTER	--I don't know.
L92191	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What the fuck--??
L92190	u4091	m273	COTTER	Next time try putting on shoes--
L92189	u4093	m273	HEATHER	It's <u>freezing</u>.
L92188	u4091	m273	COTTER	--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
L92187	u4093	m273	HEATHER	How's she going to know where to--
L92186	u4091	m273	COTTER	Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
L92184	u4091	m273	COTTER	Down there in the Park.
L92183	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Where?
L92182	u4091	m273	COTTER	Heather, does that look like Domini there?
L92181	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Boy Kurth.
L92180	u4091	m273	COTTER	No idea--goddamitt!
L92179	u4093	m273	HEATHER	You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
L92178	u4091	m273	COTTER	Fucking owl!
L92177	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Cotter?
L92176	u4091	m273	COTTER	--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
L92175	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
L92174	u4091	m273	COTTER	--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
L92173	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
L92129	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
L92128	u4091	m273	COTTER	She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
L92126	u4091	m273	COTTER	Don't have one.
L92125	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Fire escape??
L92119	u4091	m273	COTTER	My room, asleep, last I checked.
L92118	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Where's Domini?
L92067	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Gimme it!
L92066	u4091	m273	COTTER	I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
L92065	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Where <u>is</u> it?
L92023	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Still don't see it--
L92022	u4091	m273	COTTER	Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
L91937	u4091	m273	COTTER	I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
L91936	u4093	m273	HEATHER	English.
L91933	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
L91932	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
L91931	u4091	m273	COTTER	Mi casa y su casa!
L91928	u4091	m273	COTTER	Just go.
L91927	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Too busy eating us?
L91926	u4091	m273	COTTER	Get inside quick, they'll stop.
L91923	u4091	m273	COTTER	What?
L91922	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--Cotter: shut up.
L91921	u4091	m273	COTTER	Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
L91915	u4091	m273	COTTER	Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
L91914	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What about night?
L91908	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
L91907	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Me, too.
L91849	u4091	m273	COTTER	--coming out of the water--
L91848	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--yeah, a hand or something--
L91827	u4091	m273	COTTER	What're you doing with all this shit?
L91826	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Get <u>out</u> of here!
L91817	u4091	m273	COTTER	What're you, nuts?
L91816	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What're you, crazy??
L91794	u4091	m273	COTTER	Butt-ugly owl.
L91793	u4093	m273	HEATHER	We should be so lucky.
L91785	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Try a long walk.
L91784	u4091	m273	COTTER	No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
L91783	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
L91782	u4091	m273	COTTER	No.
L91781	u4093	m273	HEATHER	No fucking.
L91780	u4091	m273	COTTER	Yeah?
L91779	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
L91778	u4091	m273	COTTER	What?
L91777	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What I never could figure about the movie?
L91776	u4091	m273	COTTER	Ask me what I don't have.
L91775	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What movies?
L91774	u4091	m273	COTTER	I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
L91773	u4093	m273	HEATHER	If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
L91772	u4091	m273	COTTER	So where the hell am I going to sleep?
L91771	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Never would've guessed.
L91770	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
L91769	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Nice tent.
L91728	u4091	m273	COTTER	Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
L91727	u4093	m273	HEATHER	You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
L91666	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Shut-up.
L91665	u4091	m273	COTTER	That's what Josh and Mike said.
L91664	u4093	m273	HEATHER	I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
L91656	u4093	m273	HEATHER	I do.
L91655	u4091	m273	COTTER	I don't believe this.
L91649	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
L91648	u4091	m273	COTTER	From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
L91612	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
L91611	u4093	m273	HEATHER	You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
L91606	u4091	m273	COTTER	"--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! ""Blair Witch: The Real Story!"""

L101388	u4202	m280	PEARL	It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
L101387	u4193	m280	BILL	We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
L101161	u4202	m280	PEARL	I know damn well she's there.

L101159	u4202	m280	PEARL	Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
L100905	u4202	m280	PEARL	Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
L100904	u4193	m280	BILL	You people really don't like dogs.
L100903	u4202	m280	PEARL	Don't feed that dog.
L101047	u4204	m280	SHOTGUN	Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
L101046	u4193	m280	BILL	Yeah?
L101045	u4204	m280	SHOTGUN	Hey, kid.
L101041	u4204	m280	SHOTGUN	How the hell should I know?
L101040	u4193	m280	BILL	Died there?  How?
L101039	u4204	m280	SHOTGUN	Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
L101038	u4193	m280	BILL	Is it true?
L100902	u4193	m280	BILL	Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
L100901	u4204	m280	SHOTGUN	Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
L100900	u4193	m280	BILL	Then what do you care?
L100899	u4204	m280	SHOTGUN	Hell no!

L101248	u4193	m280	BILL	Go for it.
L101247	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
L101245	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
L101244	u4193	m280	BILL	...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
L101114	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Damn.  It's so...fresh.
L101113	u4193	m280	BILL	You think that's really him?
L101112	u4200	m280	MAURICE	This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand... There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
L101111	u4193	m280	BILL	What the hell you talking about?
L101110	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
L101105	u4193	m280	BILL	Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
L101104	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
L101101	u4200	m280	MAURICE	"Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than ""some."""
L101100	u4193	m280	BILL	Just some flies.
L101099	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
L100881	u4193	m280	BILL	Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
L100880	u4200	m280	MAURICE	'S up?
L100874	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Take who where?  What you smokin'?
L100873	u4193	m280	BILL	"You didn't hear that?  ""Take him... "" Something.  ""Bury him"" or..."
L100868	u4193	m280	BILL	Keep smokin', fool.
L100867	u4200	m280	MAURICE	The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
L100866	u4193	m280	BILL	Are you nuts?
L100861	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
L100860	u4193	m280	BILL	What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
L100859	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
L100858	u4193	m280	BILL	Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
L100831	u4193	m280	BILL	So what the hell's the good news?
L100830	u4200	m280	MAURICE	We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
L101440	u4193	m280	BILL	Or just Hell-adjacent...
L101439	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Is this Hell?
L101434	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Anywhere but here.
L101433	u4193	m280	BILL	Climb out to where?
L101432	u4201	m280	PATRICK	We can climb out.
L101393	u4193	m280	BILL	Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
L101392	u4201	m280	PATRICK	You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
L101255	u4193	m280	BILL	Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
L101254	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
L101253	u4193	m280	BILL	Where's the gangsta of love?
L101164	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Damned if I know.

L101053	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Spooked?
L101052	u4193	m280	BILL	Shit.
L100893	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
L100892	u4193	m280	BILL	Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
L100890	u4193	m280	BILL	Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
L100889	u4201	m280	PATRICK	"I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I""m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --"
L100888	u4193	m280	BILL	You soundin' like the old man now.
L100885	u4201	m280	PATRICK	That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
L100884	u4193	m280	BILL	You want us to move in here?
L100842	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
L100841	u4193	m280	BILL	Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
L100839	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
L100838	u4193	m280	BILL	Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
L101016	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
L101015	u4193	m280	BILL	But that's your old hood, Pops.
L101014	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
L101013	u4193	m280	BILL	That's some terrible shit.
L101012	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	That's what?
L100983	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
L100982	u4193	m280	BILL	Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
L100981	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
L101308	u4194	m280	BONES	Bones.
L101307	u4205	m280	STANK	Wh-wh-whooo?
L101306	u4194	m280	BONES	You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
L101302	u4194	m280	BONES	Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
L101301	u4205	m280	STANK	Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
L101300	u4194	m280	BONES	Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
L101299	u4205	m280	STANK	Looking to score?
L101204	u4199	m280	MACK	Go on.  It won't kill you.
L101203	u4194	m280	BONES	I said, no thanks.
L101202	u4199	m280	MACK	Just try it.
L101201	u4194	m280	BONES	I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
L101200	u4199	m280	MACK	Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
L101199	u4194	m280	BONES	Those 'fools' are my people.
L101198	u4199	m280	MACK	Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
L101197	u4194	m280	BONES	But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
L101196	u4199	m280	MACK	It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
L101195	u4194	m280	BONES	What else?  Money.
L101191	u4199	m280	MACK	But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
L101190	u4194	m280	BONES	I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
L101189	u4199	m280	MACK	You got a nice crib here.
L101187	u4194	m280	BONES	What it will be.
L101186	u4199	m280	MACK	Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
L101438	u4194	m280	BONES	Hush, baby.
L101437	u4202	m280	PEARL	But.
L101436	u4194	m280	BONES	Where we'll always be...
L101435	u4202	m280	PEARL	Where are we, baby?
L101430	u4202	m280	PEARL	What?
L101429	u4194	m280	BONES	I want you to do something for me, baby.
L101428	u4194	m280	BONES	I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
L101427	u4202	m280	PEARL	Jimmy, you've got --
L101313	u4194	m280	BONES	No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
L101312	u4202	m280	PEARL	No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
L101182	u4202	m280	PEARL	I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
L101181	u4194	m280	BONES	Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
L100968	u4194	m280	BONES	Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
L100967	u4202	m280	PEARL	No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
L100966	u4194	m280	BONES	Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
L100965	u4202	m280	PEARL	Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
L100963	u4194	m280	BONES	Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
L100962	u4202	m280	PEARL	My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
L100961	u4194	m280	BONES	"All that shinin' and ""reader and adviser"" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise."
L100960	u4202	m280	PEARL	Let me see your hand.
L100959	u4194	m280	BONES	Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
L100958	u4202	m280	PEARL	Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
L101415	u4194	m280	BONES	Then fuck it!!!
L101414	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	You know I can't.
L101413	u4194	m280	BONES	Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
L101412	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
L101408	u4194	m280	BONES	No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
L101407	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
L101406	u4194	m280	BONES	And the hell everybody else, right?
L101405	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
L101404	u4194	m280	BONES	I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
L101382	u4194	m280	BONES	Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
L101381	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	How did you get in here?
L101380	u4194	m280	BONES	What it will be.
L101225	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
L101224	u4194	m280	BONES	Since we was just grasshoppers...
L101223	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Sorry, my brother.
L101210	u4194	m280	BONES	I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
L101209	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
L101185	u4194	m280	BONES	We met.
L101184	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
L100957	u4194	m280	BONES	That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
L100956	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
L100955	u4194	m280	BONES	Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
L100954	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
L100953	u4194	m280	BONES	They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
L100952	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
L100951	u4194	m280	BONES	Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
L100950	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
L101403	u4202	m280	PEARL	My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
L101402	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
L101371	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Mother!  No.
L101370	u4202	m280	PEARL	Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
L101364	u4202	m280	PEARL	Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
L101363	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
L101362	u4202	m280	PEARL	We'll have to sneak in.
L101332	u4202	m280	PEARL	Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
L101331	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
L101330	u4202	m280	PEARL	Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
L101329	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Aren't you gonna do something about it?
L101328	u4202	m280	PEARL	Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
L101327	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Who?
L101326	u4202	m280	PEARL	He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
L101276	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
L101275	u4202	m280	PEARL	Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
L101274	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
L101273	u4202	m280	PEARL	You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
L101271	u4202	m280	PEARL	Your father.  He was your father.
L101270	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
L101269	u4202	m280	PEARL	If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
L101268	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
L101267	u4202	m280	PEARL	It's alright, baby.
L101238	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
L101237	u4202	m280	PEARL	Please.  It's for your own good.
L101236	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	All the more reason I should be here.
L101235	u4202	m280	PEARL	I lied.
L101234	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
L101233	u4202	m280	PEARL	...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
L101082	u4202	m280	PEARL	Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
L101081	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	And what's that?
L101080	u4202	m280	PEARL	Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
L101079	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Have you ever been inside?
L101078	u4202	m280	PEARL	Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
L101077	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
L101076	u4202	m280	PEARL	I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
L101075	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
L101074	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	You mean as opposed to your life?
L101073	u4202	m280	PEARL	You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
L101072	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	I have to finish this for class.
L101071	u4202	m280	PEARL	Aren't you going to join us?
L101475	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	I can't!
L101474	u4201	m280	PATRICK	We gotta jump!
L101456	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Here!
L101455	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	I can't find you.
L101454	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
L101453	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Okay, okay.  Listen:
L101452	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Patrick, he's...
L101451	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Bill!  Bill?!
L101450	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	I'm here.
L101376	u4201	m280	PATRICK	My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
L101375	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
L101140	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
L101139	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
L101138	u4201	m280	PATRICK	It's alright.  If you want to go home...
L101137	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	I can't.  Not yet.
L101134	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
L101133	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
L101132	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
L101131	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
L101126	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
L101125	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Cinn?
L101034	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
L101033	u4201	m280	PATRICK	And you believe her?
L101032	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
L101031	u4201	m280	PATRICK	The dead get out?
L101030	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
L101029	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Lucky thing.
L101028	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
L101027	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
L101026	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
L101025	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
L101024	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
L101023	u4201	m280	PATRICK	What else does she say?
L101022	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
L101021	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Why?
L101020	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	That place is already bad luck.
L101019	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Careful.  That's bad luck.
L100925	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Anytime.  Be seeing you.
L100924	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
L100919	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I manage them.
L100918	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	How do you know?
L100917	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
L100916	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	Are they on the radio?
L100911	u4195	m280	CINNABAR	You moved into this block?
L100910	u4201	m280	PATRICK	no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
L100806	u4196	m280	JASON	Fuck it.  Alright.
L100805	u4205	m280	STANK	Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
L100804	u4205	m280	STANK	I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
L100803	u4196	m280	JASON	Where is it?
L100802	u4205	m280	STANK	Let me see it.
L100801	u4196	m280	JASON	Let me see it.
L100800	u4205	m280	STANK	Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
L100799	u4196	m280	JASON	You got the shit?
L100798	u4205	m280	STANK	You got the cash?
L100797	u4205	m280	STANK	Back here.  At the end of the block.
L100796	u4196	m280	JASON	We're here.  Where the hell are you?
L101465	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Daddy?
L101464	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
L101463	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Dad?
L101462	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Please...help me...
L101298	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
L101297	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	That's the past.  It's dead.
L101296	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
L101295	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	You were just a kid.
L101294	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
L101293	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
L101292	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
L101291	u4201	m280	PATRICK	From what?
L101290	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
L101289	u4201	m280	PATRICK	You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
L101288	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
L101287	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Did you do it?
L101176	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
L101175	u4201	m280	PATRICK	You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
L101174	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
L101173	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
L101172	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
L101169	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
L101168	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	What are we doing down here?
L101167	u4201	m280	PATRICK	A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
L101166	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
L101018	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
L101017	u4201	m280	PATRICK	But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
L101221	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
L101220	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	No way man...
L101010	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	That's it.  Get out.  Now!
L101009	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Nice rack.  How old is --
L101008	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
L101007	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
L101006	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
L101005	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
L100998	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
L100997	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	I didn't sell it.
L100996	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
L100995	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	What building?
L100994	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
L100993	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Or you didn't know what to do with it.
L100992	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
L100991	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
L100990	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
L100989	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
L100988	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
L100987	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	Don't call me that.
L100986	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
L100985	u4197	m280	JEREMIAH	What the hell do you want?
L101219	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Now you.
L101218	u4199	m280	MACK	What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
L100977	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
L100976	u4199	m280	MACK	You was just doing your job.
L100975	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
L100973	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
L100972	u4199	m280	MACK	I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
L100971	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
L101351	u4203	m280	SAL	Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
L101350	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
L101349	u4203	m280	SAL	I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
L101348	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
L101347	u4203	m280	SAL	Shit, that was fast.
L101346	u4198	m280	LUPOVICH	I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
L100938	u4199	m280	MACK	No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
L100937	u4205	m280	STANK	We just thought...
L100932	u4199	m280	MACK	How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
L100931	u4205	m280	STANK	But --
L100930	u4199	m280	MACK	That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
L100929	u4205	m280	STANK	We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
L100928	u4199	m280	MACK	Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
L101319	u4199	m280	MACK	Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
L101318	u4207	m280	WEAZE	It was just like in my head.
L101317	u4199	m280	MACK	Then how'd you hear it, fool?
L101316	u4207	m280	WEAZE	No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
L101315	u4199	m280	MACK	You boys been hitting the pipe?
L100936	u4199	m280	MACK	Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
L100935	u4207	m280	WEAZE	That's all we did, steal their ride.
L100934	u4199	m280	MACK	You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
L100933	u4207	m280	WEAZE	We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
L101092	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
L101091	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat. Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
L101069	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Post-toasted's more like it.
L101068	u4200	m280	MAURICE	I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
L101067	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
L101064	u4200	m280	MAURICE	"Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  ""Special recipe"".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile."
L101063	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Why not?  He eats everything else.
L101062	u4200	m280	MAURICE	The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
L101061	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
L100887	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
L100886	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
L100865	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Potential toxic dump site.
L100864	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
L100863	u4200	m280	MAURICE	"This is Patrick...  ""...And this is Patrick on crack."" Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't..."
L100862	u4201	m280	PATRICK	You gotta use your imagination.
L100857	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
L100856	u4200	m280	MAURICE	"He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: ""This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."""
L100855	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Not that I remember.
L100854	u4200	m280	MAURICE	You haven't?
L100853	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Yeah, you heard of him?
L100852	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Jimmy Bones?
L100848	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
L100847	u4200	m280	MAURICE	And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
L100834	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
L100833	u4200	m280	MAURICE	"Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  ""Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."""
L100832	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
L100915	u4202	m280	PEARL	Should I?
L100914	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
L100913	u4202	m280	PEARL	That building?
L100912	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Not really to live, just to play.
L100909	u4202	m280	PEARL	No thanks.
L100908	u4200	m280	MAURICE	Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
L100907	u4202	m280	PEARL	I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
L100906	u4200	m280	MAURICE	And some people need their medication tweaked.
L101419	u4202	m280	PEARL	Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
L101418	u4201	m280	PATRICK	It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
L101401	u4202	m280	PEARL	The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
L101400	u4201	m280	PATRICK	But the place burned to the ground.
L101399	u4202	m280	PEARL	... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
L101378	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Save him?  What are you talking about?
L101377	u4202	m280	PEARL	You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
L100923	u4202	m280	PEARL	You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
L100922	u4201	m280	PATRICK	I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
L100921	u4202	m280	PEARL	You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
L101120	u4206	m280	TIA	What we have to do is call the police.
L101119	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
L101117	u4206	m280	TIA	Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
L101116	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Evidence of what?
L101115	u4206	m280	TIA	Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
L101060	u4201	m280	PATRICK	We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
L101059	u4206	m280	TIA	There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
L100836	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Ours!
L100835	u4206	m280	TIA	Illibent?  Who's club is that?
L100829	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Moe's terms.
L100828	u4206	m280	TIA	How could that be?  The box was packed!
L100827	u4201	m280	PATRICK	Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
L114657	u4284	m286	ALICE	I'll pose any way you want.
L114656	u4295	m286	WALTER	Look -  This pose is all wrong!
L114655	u4284	m286	ALICE	Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
L114654	u4295	m286	WALTER	Whaddya mean?
L114653	u4284	m286	ALICE	It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
L114651	u4284	m286	ALICE	Are you a virgin?
L114650	u4295	m286	WALTER	What!
L114649	u4284	m286	ALICE	Walter can I ask you something?
L114648	u4295	m286	WALTER	You're breaking my concentration!
L114647	u4284	m286	ALICE	A girl with a body like mine?
L114646	u4284	m286	ALICE	Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
L114645	u4295	m286	WALTER	Um...
L114644	u4284	m286	ALICE	When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
L114643	u4295	m286	WALTER	I already told you I'm not.
L114642	u4284	m286	ALICE	Not even a little bit?
L114641	u4295	m286	WALTER	N-no...
L114640	u4284	m286	ALICE	Are you nervous, Walter?
L114639	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh it's enough...
L114638	u4284	m286	ALICE	That doesn't look like very much clay.
L114635	u4295	m286	WALTER	Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
L114634	u4284	m286	ALICE	I'm almost ready -
L114631	u4295	m286	WALTER	Shh!
L114630	u4284	m286	ALICE	It's kind of dark -
L114627	u4295	m286	WALTER	Uh-huh.
L114626	u4284	m286	ALICE	What, right now?
L114625	u4295	m286	WALTER	Tonight.
L114623	u4284	m286	ALICE	Yeah.
L114622	u4295	m286	WALTER	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
L114621	u4284	m286	ALICE	Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
L114620	u4295	m286	WALTER	I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
L114619	u4284	m286	ALICE	Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
L114618	u4295	m286	WALTER	I didn't finish talking to you!
L114617	u4284	m286	ALICE	Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
L114615	u4295	m286	WALTER	I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
L114614	u4284	m286	ALICE	What are you doing here?
L114612	u4295	m286	WALTER	I'm going home!
L114611	u4284	m286	ALICE	If you were an artist you could have created something!
L114608	u4284	m286	ALICE	Oh yeah?
L114607	u4295	m286	WALTER	That's not true I am a sculptor!
L114591	u4284	m286	ALICE	I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
L114590	u4295	m286	WALTER	I just might.
L114589	u4284	m286	ALICE	Would you like to do me?
L114579	u4295	m286	WALTER	Not anymore!
L114578	u4284	m286	ALICE	Don't you work here?
L114288	u4285	m286	ART	Righto.
L114287	u4290	m286	LOU	See you later -
L114285	u4285	m286	ART	He made a cat.
L114284	u4290	m286	LOU	What did he do?
L114283	u4285	m286	ART	Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
L114282	u4290	m286	LOU	What the hell's going on?
L114123	u4285	m286	ART	You know it.  I'm out of here.
L114122	u4290	m286	LOU	Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
L114121	u4285	m286	ART	Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
L114120	u4290	m286	LOU	Is the manager cooperating?
L114119	u4285	m286	ART	Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
L114118	u4290	m286	LOU	Anything new?
L114117	u4285	m286	ART	Alright we're clear.
L114874	u4295	m286	WALTER	Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
L114873	u4286	m286	CARLA	Walter...stay away from me!
L114869	u4286	m286	CARLA	There's...a body inside that statue!
L114868	u4295	m286	WALTER	What?
L114867	u4286	m286	CARLA	Walter...there's...
L114857	u4295	m286	WALTER	Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
L114856	u4286	m286	CARLA	Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
L114855	u4295	m286	WALTER	Would you let me make...a statue of you?
L114854	u4286	m286	CARLA	Just about anything, Walter.
L114853	u4295	m286	WALTER	I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
L114852	u4286	m286	CARLA	Forget it.
L114851	u4295	m286	WALTER	I'm sorry about what I said before.
L114837	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
L114836	u4286	m286	CARLA	Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
L114835	u4286	m286	CARLA	Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
L114834	u4295	m286	WALTER	Why not?!
L114833	u4286	m286	CARLA	Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
L114832	u4295	m286	WALTER	No! I want to talk about it now!
L114831	u4286	m286	CARLA	Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
L114830	u4295	m286	WALTER	You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
L114829	u4286	m286	CARLA	Walter, I'm sorry...
L114828	u4295	m286	WALTER	But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
L114822	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
L114821	u4286	m286	CARLA	Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
L114818	u4286	m286	CARLA	What are you trying to say?
L114817	u4295	m286	WALTER	- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
L114815	u4295	m286	WALTER	Carla -
L114814	u4286	m286	CARLA	Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
L114813	u4295	m286	WALTER	I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
L114812	u4286	m286	CARLA	I like you very much, Walter.
L114811	u4295	m286	WALTER	That means you like me!
L114810	u4286	m286	CARLA	Of course I do!
L114809	u4295	m286	WALTER	You think I'm creative?
L114808	u4286	m286	CARLA	Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
L114807	u4295	m286	WALTER	Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
L114806	u4286	m286	CARLA	Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
L114805	u4295	m286	WALTER	Hm...
L114804	u4286	m286	CARLA	Nice night out...
L114799	u4295	m286	WALTER	Bye!
L114798	u4286	m286	CARLA	Goodbye.
L114795	u4295	m286	WALTER	I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
L114794	u4286	m286	CARLA	Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
L114793	u4295	m286	WALTER	Are you ready?
L114792	u4286	m286	CARLA	Thank you.
L114791	u4295	m286	WALTER	I mean, you look so pretty.
L114741	u4295	m286	WALTER	I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
L114740	u4286	m286	CARLA	Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
L114739	u4295	m286	WALTER	I know what it is to be ignored.
L114731	u4286	m286	CARLA	Every word...
L114730	u4295	m286	WALTER	It's true, isn't it?
L114729	u4295	m286	WALTER	All about me...
L114728	u4286	m286	CARLA	Yes Walter.
L114727	u4295	m286	WALTER	Did you hear what he said?
L114706	u4295	m286	WALTER	Sorry...
L114705	u4286	m286	CARLA	Walter!  Jeez!
L114704	u4295	m286	WALTER	May I please have another little kiss?
L114702	u4295	m286	WALTER	There there...
L114701	u4286	m286	CARLA	Where where...
L114700	u4295	m286	WALTER	Here here...
L114699	u4286	m286	CARLA	More champagne, your majesty?
L114695	u4286	m286	CARLA	Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
L114694	u4295	m286	WALTER	You think she's better than Murdered Man?
L114680	u4295	m286	WALTER	Better!
L114679	u4286	m286	CARLA	Is it murdered man?
L114678	u4295	m286	WALTER	Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
L114677	u4286	m286	CARLA	Oh yeah?
L114676	u4295	m286	WALTER	I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
L114675	u4286	m286	CARLA	What's up, Walter?
L114671	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh...
L114670	u4286	m286	CARLA	These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
L114553	u4295	m286	WALTER	Carla...
L114552	u4286	m286	CARLA	Hi Walter.
L114538	u4286	m286	CARLA	Now you're a professional!
L114537	u4295	m286	WALTER	Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
L114507	u4295	m286	WALTER	It wasn't easy.
L114506	u4286	m286	CARLA	How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
L114503	u4295	m286	WALTER	Me too.
L114502	u4286	m286	CARLA	Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
L114497	u4286	m286	CARLA	You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
L114496	u4295	m286	WALTER	Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
L114495	u4286	m286	CARLA	Let's see it.
L114494	u4295	m286	WALTER	It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
L114493	u4286	m286	CARLA	Look at the size of it!
L114464	u4295	m286	WALTER	Yeah it was all just an accident.
L114463	u4286	m286	CARLA	It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
L114452	u4295	m286	WALTER	Murdered man.
L114451	u4286	m286	CARLA	What's it called?
L114450	u4295	m286	WALTER	It's a...full length life-size figure!
L114449	u4286	m286	CARLA	Great!  What is it?
L114248	u4286	m286	CARLA	Of course...it's wonderful.
L114247	u4295	m286	WALTER	You really like it?
L114224	u4295	m286	WALTER	Honest?
L114223	u4286	m286	CARLA	I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
L114216	u4295	m286	WALTER	A thing I made.
L114215	u4286	m286	CARLA	Don't worry about him...what have you got?
L114691	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	I'm honored to know this man.
L114690	u4286	m286	CARLA	Walter...I can't believe it.
L114687	u4286	m286	CARLA	When did you make this, Walter?
L114686	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	Put it in the middle of the room!
L114665	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	Hm.
L114664	u4286	m286	CARLA	Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
L114663	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
L114662	u4286	m286	CARLA	It was.
L114661	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	I hope this was made with egg whites!
L114660	u4286	m286	CARLA	Here you go, enjoy.
L114131	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	Is it?  I've forgotten.
L114130	u4286	m286	CARLA	That's word for word.
L114598	u4286	m286	CARLA	Well, it all depends, Leonard...
L114597	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Would you pose for me for free?
L114533	u4288	m286	LEONARD	You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
L114532	u4286	m286	CARLA	Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
L114531	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
L114528	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
L114527	u4286	m286	CARLA	That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
L114526	u4288	m286	LEONARD	It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
L114522	u4286	m286	CARLA	You're right.  We should build a collection first.
L114521	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
L114520	u4286	m286	CARLA	What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
L114519	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
L114518	u4286	m286	CARLA	Why not?
L114517	u4288	m286	LEONARD	No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
L114515	u4288	m286	LEONARD	I admit it.
L114514	u4286	m286	CARLA	Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
L114512	u4286	m286	CARLA	Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
L114511	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Don't ask.
L114510	u4286	m286	CARLA	I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
L114509	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Nothing...nothing at all.
L114508	u4286	m286	CARLA	What's the matter with you?
L114491	u4286	m286	CARLA	Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
L114490	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
L114466	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
L114465	u4286	m286	CARLA	Are you alright?
L114454	u4286	m286	CARLA	When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
L114453	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Murdered...man?...
L114446	u4288	m286	LEONARD	I'm totally serious!
L114445	u4286	m286	CARLA	Are you trying to be funny?
L114437	u4286	m286	CARLA	Leonard, what are you doing?
L114436	u4288	m286	LEONARD	You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
L114243	u4288	m286	LEONARD	I wouldn't give up your day job.
L114242	u4286	m286	CARLA	Maybe so...
L114211	u4288	m286	LEONARD	What are you doing here so early?
L114210	u4286	m286	CARLA	Hi Walter...
L114209	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
L114208	u4286	m286	CARLA	I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
L114113	u4286	m286	CARLA	Do you have to be so cold to him?
L114112	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
L114864	u4289	m286	LINK	Yeah, right outside the door!
L114863	u4287	m286	CUFF	That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
L114803	u4287	m286	CUFF	Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
L114802	u4289	m286	LINK	No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
L114801	u4287	m286	CUFF	Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
L114722	u4287	m286	CUFF	No man I'm on my own plane.
L114721	u4289	m286	LINK	Didn't you hear him?
L114720	u4287	m286	CUFF	What did he say?
L114685	u4287	m286	CUFF	Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
L114684	u4289	m286	LINK	Man this is heavy!
L114600	u4289	m286	LINK	Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
L114599	u4287	m286	CUFF	Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
L114561	u4287	m286	CUFF	Let's check out the scene.
L114560	u4289	m286	LINK	Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
L114559	u4287	m286	CUFF	Man look at that get up !
L114550	u4289	m286	LINK	Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
L114549	u4287	m286	CUFF	There's that weird dude again.
L114458	u4287	m286	CUFF	I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
L114457	u4289	m286	LINK	Now what kind of statue was that?
L114456	u4287	m286	CUFF	I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
L114455	u4289	m286	LINK	Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
L114424	u4287	m286	CUFF	I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
L114423	u4289	m286	LINK	I wonder what his deal is.
L114421	u4289	m286	LINK	I know, man.
L114420	u4287	m286	CUFF	I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
L114419	u4289	m286	LINK	I know, man.
L114418	u4287	m286	CUFF	But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
L114417	u4289	m286	LINK	I know, man.
L114416	u4287	m286	CUFF	I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.

L114276	u4289	m286	LINK	Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
L114146	u4289	m286	LINK	I do the research.
L114145	u4287	m286	CUFF	It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
L114778	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
L114777	u4295	m286	WALTER	Yeah?

L114774	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Never mind...
L114773	u4295	m286	WALTER	Well, w-what did you do?
L114772	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
L114771	u4295	m286	WALTER	Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
L114770	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
L114769	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Put it down, Walter.

L114736	u4295	m286	WALTER	Yeah and what would I say?
L114735	u4288	m286	LEONARD	You might talk too much.
L114734	u4295	m286	WALTER	Yeah, why?
L114733	u4288	m286	LEONARD	You better hold off on the bubbly.
L114530	u4288	m286	LEONARD	These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
L114529	u4295	m286	WALTER	A show..how soon can we go?
L114525	u4288	m286	LEONARD	N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
L114524	u4295	m286	WALTER	A show?!  Like this Sunday?
L114499	u4295	m286	WALTER	You want me to open a window or something?
L114498	u4288	m286	LEONARD	It's hot in here...
L114462	u4295	m286	WALTER	Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
L114461	u4288	m286	LEONARD	You didn't mean to what?
L114460	u4295	m286	WALTER	I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
L114459	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Well...why murdered man?
L114448	u4295	m286	WALTER	I-I already got a new one!
L114447	u4288	m286	LEONARD	The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
L114442	u4295	m286	WALTER	What, Mr. De Santis?
L114441	u4288	m286	LEONARD	You know what that proves?
L114439	u4288	m286	LEONARD	What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
L114438	u4295	m286	WALTER	Hiya Carla.
L114434	u4295	m286	WALTER	They are?
L114433	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...

L114297	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
L114296	u4295	m286	WALTER	I don't have another cat!
L114295	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
L114294	u4295	m286	WALTER	Well...
L114293	u4288	m286	LEONARD	No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
L114292	u4295	m286	WALTER	Well I don't know -
L114291	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
L114290	u4295	m286	WALTER	Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
L114259	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Enough already about it - get to work!
L114258	u4295	m286	WALTER	People seem to like my cat.

L114244	u4295	m286	WALTER	All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
L114241	u4295	m286	WALTER	Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
L114240	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?

L114238	u4295	m286	WALTER	I didn't mean to.
L114237	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Well...why did you put a knife in it?
L114231	u4288	m286	LEONARD	You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
L114230	u4295	m286	WALTER	You want to buy it, put it in the club?
L114229	u4288	m286	LEONARD	Well it sure looks dead enough.

L114787	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
L114786	u4295	m286	WALTER	Why not?
L114785	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	I won't say good luck, Walter.

L114138	u4295	m286	WALTER	I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
L114137	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
L114136	u4295	m286	WALTER	I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
L114129	u4295	m286	WALTER	Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -
L114128	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	Well I'm overjoyed.
L114127	u4295	m286	WALTER	I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
L114126	u4291	m286	MAXWELL	I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
L114325	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
L114324	u4295	m286	WALTER	Gee.  Thanks.
L114323	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...

L114318	u4295	m286	WALTER	I don't think so Mayolia.
L114316	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
L114315	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	Well, I'll go home with you.
L114314	u4295	m286	WALTER	I can't.  I gotta go home.
L114313	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
L114312	u4295	m286	WALTER	That's really nice of you Mayolia.
L114311	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
L114310	u4295	m286	WALTER	T-turned on?
L114309	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	It's like...you've turned on.
L114307	u4295	m286	WALTER	Really?
L114306	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
L114305	u4295	m286	WALTER	With Dead Cat?
L114304	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
L114303	u4295	m286	WALTER	Hello Mayolia.
L114281	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	Your work, the layers of irony.
L114280	u4295	m286	WALTER	What do you get?
L114279	u4292	m286	MAYOLIA	I get it Walter.  I get it.

L114396	u4295	m286	WALTER	Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
L114395	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
L114393	u4295	m286	WALTER	Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
L114392	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
L114391	u4295	m286	WALTER	I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
L114390	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
L114389	u4295	m286	WALTER	I was just straightening up the place.
L114388	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
L114387	u4295	m286	WALTER	Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
L114386	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	What's all the noise in here!
L114186	u4295	m286	WALTER	Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
L114185	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	Good night Walter...
L114184	u4295	m286	WALTER	OK Mrs. Swicker.
L114183	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	If you see him.
L114182	u4295	m286	WALTER	T-tell him that?
L114181	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
L114180	u4295	m286	WALTER	Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
L114178	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
L114177	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
L114176	u4295	m286	WALTER	I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
L114175	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
L114174	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh, OK.
L114173	u4293	m286	MRS. SWICKER	Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
L114172	u4295	m286	WALTER	Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
L115486	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
L115485	u4296	m287	AMILYN	I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
L115484	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
L115483	u4296	m287	AMILYN	I look horrible.
L115482	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	Cheer up.  You may still.
L115481	u4296	m287	AMILYN	I had him in my grasp.
L115480	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
L115479	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	Shut up!  You let him have it!
L115478	u4296	m287	AMILYN	My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
L115477	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	What's wrong with you!?!
L115279	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
L115278	u4296	m287	AMILYN	I don't think this is gold.
L115442	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Yes!
L115441	u4297	m287	ANDY	Let's move out!
L115440	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Nice to feel needed.
L115434	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	What's with you?
L115433	u4297	m287	ANDY	Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
L115431	u4297	m287	ANDY	Coach knows what abs are?
L115430	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
L115429	u4297	m287	ANDY	... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
L115064	u4297	m287	ANDY	Litter, yeah!
L115063	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Well, um... litter?
L115059	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
L115058	u4297	m287	ANDY	I like it.  Can I be your friend?
L115762	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
L115761	u4297	m287	ANDY	Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
L115698	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
L115697	u4297	m287	ANDY	Buffy!  Looking tasty.
L115436	u4297	m287	ANDY	Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
L115435	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Don't grab me, okay?
L115080	u4300	m287	BUFFY	He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
L115079	u4297	m287	ANDY	Man has a complex.
L114990	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Andy!
L114989	u4297	m287	ANDY	Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
L114988	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Nice game.
L115377	u4312	m287	PIKE	I mean it.
L115376	u4298	m287	BENNY	I'm hungry.
L115375	u4312	m287	PIKE	Get away from here.
L115374	u4298	m287	BENNY	Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
L115373	u4298	m287	BENNY	The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
L115372	u4312	m287	PIKE	No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
L115371	u4298	m287	BENNY	I... feel.... pretty.
L115370	u4312	m287	PIKE	You look like shit, Benny.
L115369	u4298	m287	BENNY	I'm fine.
L115368	u4312	m287	PIKE	Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
L115367	u4298	m287	BENNY	Invite me in, Pike.
L115366	u4312	m287	PIKE	Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
L115365	u4298	m287	BENNY	Let me in.
L115364	u4312	m287	PIKE	Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
L115164	u4312	m287	PIKE	Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
L115163	u4298	m287	BENNY	Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
L115162	u4312	m287	PIKE	You think?  Split?
L115161	u4298	m287	BENNY	When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
L115140	u4312	m287	PIKE	Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
L115139	u4298	m287	BENNY	I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
L115138	u4312	m287	PIKE	Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
L115137	u4298	m287	BENNY	Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
L115136	u4312	m287	PIKE	Would you sleep with them?
L115135	u4298	m287	BENNY	They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
L115134	u4312	m287	PIKE	You didn't like them.
L115133	u4298	m287	BENNY	Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
L115132	u4312	m287	PIKE	Bummer metaphor.
L115131	u4298	m287	BENNY	Hey!  She wasted my dog!
L115125	u4312	m287	PIKE	We hate you guys!
L115124	u4298	m287	BENNY	You're the guys from the movie!
L115118	u4312	m287	PIKE	Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
L115117	u4298	m287	BENNY	Figures.
L115108	u4298	m287	BENNY	Amazing!
L115107	u4312	m287	PIKE	It's coffee.
L115106	u4312	m287	PIKE	We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
L115105	u4298	m287	BENNY	That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
L115104	u4312	m287	PIKE	Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
L114974	u4298	m287	BENNY	Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
L114973	u4312	m287	PIKE	No, we didn't.
L114968	u4312	m287	PIKE	Wrong answer!  No prize.
L114967	u4298	m287	BENNY	Suck!
L114966	u4312	m287	PIKE	Booo!
L115596	u4299	m287	BIKER	Down there.
L115595	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Which way did she go?
L115594	u4299	m287	BIKER	My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
L115593	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Wheels?
L115592	u4299	m287	BIKER	Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
L115591	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Yes.
L115590	u4299	m287	BIKER	You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
L115589	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Did you see a girl come by here?
L115641	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
L115640	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	He doesn't look fifty.
L115625	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Hi, guys.
L115624	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Hi, Buffy.
L115428	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Eeyuu.
L115427	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Dying.
L115174	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Don't tread on the earth?
L115173	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
L115042	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
L115041	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
L114977	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Probably.  What movie is this?
L114976	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Oh, my God.  Is that true?
L114959	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
L114958	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Yeah, I guess.
L114957	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
L114950	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What's playing there?
L114949	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Excellent.
L115668	u4301	m287	BUFFY'S MOM	Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
L115667	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
L115666	u4301	m287	BUFFY'S MOM	What's Bobby gonna say?
L115665	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Maybe.
L115664	u4301	m287	BUFFY'S MOM	Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
L115663	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Yeah?
L115662	u4301	m287	BUFFY'S MOM	Buffy, honey?
L115254	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Uum... around ten?
L115253	u4301	m287	BUFFY'S MOM	Do you know what time it is?
L115722	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	I'm out of here.  Jenny.
L115721	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You left me a message?
L115720	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	You weren't home.  Like always.
L115719	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You broke up with my machine?
L115718	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Didn't you get my message?
L115717	u4300	m287	BUFFY	No, you didn't.  When?
L115716	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
L115715	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I don't understand.
L115714	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	I'm here with Jenny.
L115713	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I thought we were meeting here.
L115712	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Buffy, what are you doing here?
L115537	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
L115536	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
L115439	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	So I noticed.
L115438	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
L115262	u4300	m287	BUFFY	'Bye.
L115261	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
L115260	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
L115259	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
L115258	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I do?  I guess I do.
L115257	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
L115184	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Jealous?
L115183	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
L115045	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Hi.
L115044	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Hey there.
L115035	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Nothing.  It was just a dream.
L115034	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Come on, what was it?
L115033	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Nothing.
L115032	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	What'd you dream about?
L115031	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	You were having a nightmare.
L115030	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
L115025	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Mmmnkay.
L115024	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
L115023	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
L115022	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	It's the news, Buffy.
L115021	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What show is this?
L115020	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
L115019	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Something like that.
L115018	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
L115017	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
L115007	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
L115006	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	You okay?
L115825	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I am so sure.
L115824	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	I am a God!  A God!
L115813	u4300	m287	BUFFY	No...
L115812	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
L115811	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I think you've forgotten something.
L115810	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	You're even weaker than the others.
L115808	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	What?
L115807	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
L115806	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
L115840	u4312	m287	PIKE	You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
L115839	u4300	m287	BUFFY	We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
L115838	u4312	m287	PIKE	Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
L115837	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
L115836	u4312	m287	PIKE	I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
L115820	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Get away from me!
L115819	u4312	m287	PIKE	Are you okay?
L115764	u4312	m287	PIKE	Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
L115763	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Good thing one of us was prepared.
L115760	u4312	m287	PIKE	You say that like it's a bad thing.
L115759	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
L115758	u4312	m287	PIKE	Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
L115757	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm going out the front.
L115729	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
L115728	u4312	m287	PIKE	Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
L115727	u4312	m287	PIKE	Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
L115726	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm glad you came.
L115725	u4312	m287	PIKE	That's me.
L115724	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Pretty shallow of you.
L115723	u4312	m287	PIKE	I crashed your party.
L115692	u4312	m287	PIKE	Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
L115691	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Leave me alone.
L115690	u4312	m287	PIKE	I should have known.
L115689	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
L115688	u4312	m287	PIKE	But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
L115687	u4300	m287	BUFFY	He did what he was supposed to.
L115686	u4312	m287	PIKE	Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
L115685	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
L115684	u4312	m287	PIKE	You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
L115683	u4300	m287	BUFFY	It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
L115682	u4312	m287	PIKE	I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
L115681	u4300	m287	BUFFY	In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
L115680	u4312	m287	PIKE	What for?
L115679	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm going to the dance.
L115678	u4312	m287	PIKE	Second word... sound like 'dance'.
L115677	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm going to the senior dance.
L115676	u4312	m287	PIKE	Come again?
L115675	u4300	m287	BUFFY	For the dance.
L115674	u4312	m287	PIKE	Dress, huh?  What for?
L115673	u4300	m287	BUFFY	A dress.
L115672	u4312	m287	PIKE	Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
L115671	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
L115670	u4312	m287	PIKE	I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
L115604	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Merrick...
L115603	u4312	m287	PIKE	Who?
L115602	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
L115601	u4312	m287	PIKE	Buffy?  What's wrong?
L115588	u4312	m287	PIKE	I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
L115587	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
L115585	u4312	m287	PIKE	Besides, Oxnard sucks.
L115584	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Thanks.
L115583	u4312	m287	PIKE	I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
L115582	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Why'd you come back?
L115581	u4312	m287	PIKE	I know.
L115580	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I didn't expect to see you.
L115521	u4312	m287	PIKE	You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
L115520	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Yeah?
L115519	u4312	m287	PIKE	Hey, Buffy...
L115518	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Mmkay.
L115517	u4312	m287	PIKE	Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
L115516	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You sure?
L115515	u4312	m287	PIKE	I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
L115514	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
L115513	u4312	m287	PIKE	No, you're not.
L115512	u4300	m287	BUFFY	It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
L115511	u4312	m287	PIKE	I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
L115510	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
L115509	u4312	m287	PIKE	I'll back that up.
L115508	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Things are kind of confusing.
L115505	u4300	m287	BUFFY	It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
L115504	u4312	m287	PIKE	Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
L115503	u4312	m287	PIKE	Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
L115502	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Where are you gonna go?
L115501	u4312	m287	PIKE	Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
L115500	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Well, stay here tonight.
L115499	u4312	m287	PIKE	Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
L115498	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
L115497	u4312	m287	PIKE	God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
L115496	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Yeah.
L115495	u4312	m287	PIKE	They were vampires, weren't they?
L115494	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Not exactly.
L115493	u4312	m287	PIKE	Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
L115492	u4312	m287	PIKE	Water.  Okay.
L115491	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You want some water or something?
L115490	u4312	m287	PIKE	Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
L115489	u4300	m287	BUFFY	How are you doing?
L115473	u4312	m287	PIKE	It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
L115472	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Is that your car?
L115471	u4312	m287	PIKE	Hi there.
L115470	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Hi.
L115116	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Buffy.
L115115	u4312	m287	PIKE	Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
L115112	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You guys are thrashed.
L115111	u4312	m287	PIKE	Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
L114965	u4300	m287	BUFFY	It could happen.
L114964	u4312	m287	PIKE	Will you guys shut up, please?
L115093	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Like my homework.
L115092	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	Like what?
L115091	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
L115090	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
L115089	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Bogutude.  Blow it off.
L115088	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
L115070	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
L115069	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Bugs.
L115057	u4300	m287	BUFFY	See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
L115056	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	It is a pretty crucial subject.
L115053	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
L115052	u4300	m287	BUFFY	It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
L115707	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	I know.  I like your little outfit.
L115706	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You look way pretty, Kim.
L115705	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Yeah, whoops I came.
L115704	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
L115657	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Get out of my facial.
L115656	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
L115647	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
L115646	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
L115645	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Excuse me for having something important to do.
L115630	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Oh my God you're having an affair.
L115629	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
L115628	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
L115627	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I forgot.
L115626	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	You were supposed to be here at three.
L115147	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Get a boob job.
L115146	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
L115145	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
L115095	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
L115094	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
L115085	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Cafe Blase.
L115084	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Where?
L115083	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Let's meet tonight, okay?
L114961	u4300	m287	BUFFY	'Just remember you're in training, son'
L114960	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	What did Jeffrey's dad say?
L114952	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Nice ensemble!
L114951	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
L114948	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
L114947	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
L114944	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
L114943	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Beverly Center.
L114938	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Well, where?
L114937	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Why don't we see a movie?
L114936	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	What are we doing?
L114934	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Please.  It's so '91.
L114933	u4300	m287	BUFFY	) What do you think?
L114932	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
L115570	u4300	m287	BUFFY	He knows who I am!
L115569	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Wait!
L115535	u4300	m287	BUFFY	And where are they now?
L115534	u4310	m287	MERRICK	None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
L115533	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
L115532	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Football is my life.
L115531	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
L115530	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
L115529	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
L115528	u4310	m287	MERRICK	All right.
L115527	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
L115526	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
L115525	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
L115524	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Another distraction.  It's not right.
L115523	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
L115522	u4310	m287	MERRICK	There isn't time.
L115475	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
L115474	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Interesting.
L115451	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
L115450	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I want to die.
L115449	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
L115448	u4310	m287	MERRICK	My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
L115447	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
L115446	u4310	m287	MERRICK	But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
L115445	u4300	m287	BUFFY	We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
L115444	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I can't work this.
L115443	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
L115423	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
L115422	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Vampires of the world, beware.
L115421	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
L115420	u4310	m287	MERRICK	As for example, what?
L115419	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
L115418	u4300	m287	BUFFY	And it makes it worse when I die, right?
L115417	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
L115416	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I'm curious, is all.
L115415	u4310	m287	MERRICK	It isn't important.
L115414	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I wish you would.
L115413	u4310	m287	MERRICK	There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
L115412	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Watchers?
L115411	u4310	m287	MERRICK	It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
L115410	u4300	m287	BUFFY	How can you keep doing this?
L115409	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Not if you're careful.
L115408	u4300	m287	BUFFY	So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
L115407	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Five.
L115406	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Five?
L115405	u4310	m287	MERRICK	What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
L115404	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I...
L115403	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
L115402	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, fuck you!
L115401	u4310	m287	MERRICK	What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
L115400	u4300	m287	BUFFY	And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
L115399	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Buffy...
L115398	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
L115397	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Don't start with me again.
L115396	u4300	m287	BUFFY	A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
L115395	u4310	m287	MERRICK	A what?
L115394	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You are such a wet.
L115393	u4310	m287	MERRICK	You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
L115392	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
L115391	u4310	m287	MERRICK	It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
L115390	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
L115389	u4310	m287	MERRICK	You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
L115388	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
L115387	u4310	m287	MERRICK	And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
L115386	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Fine.
L115385	u4310	m287	MERRICK	He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
L115358	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Try to pay attention.
L115357	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What!?!
L115347	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh.
L115346	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Same one.
L115345	u4300	m287	BUFFY	They were vampires?
L115344	u4310	m287	MERRICK	All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
L115343	u4300	m287	BUFFY	My nails.
L115342	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
L115341	u4300	m287	BUFFY	If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
L115340	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
L115339	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
L115338	u4310	m287	MERRICK	No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
L115337	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
L115336	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Your turn.
L115335	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
L115334	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
L115333	u4300	m287	BUFFY	No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
L115332	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
L115331	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Put your head back.
L115330	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
L115329	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh.  Sorry.
L115328	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I don't think you understand the full implications of --
L115327	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
L115326	u4310	m287	MERRICK	It was necessary.
L115325	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
L115324	u4310	m287	MERRICK	And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
L115323	u4300	m287	BUFFY	But you threw a knife at my head!
L115322	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I had to test you.
L115321	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
L115319	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Oh.  Good.
L115318	u4300	m287	BUFFY	No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
L115317	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
L115316	u4300	m287	BUFFY	No -- you don't have to --
L115315	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Who we gonna beat?
L115314	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Who we gonna beat?
L115313	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Okay.
L115312	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
L115311	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Here?
L115310	u4310	m287	MERRICK	All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
L115309	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Sporting events, yeah.
L115308	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
L115307	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
L115306	u4310	m287	MERRICK	But you enjoyed it, yes?
L115305	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
L115304	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
L115303	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Uh... gym.
L115302	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
L115301	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Not a pressing issue.
L115300	u4310	m287	MERRICK	We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
L115299	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
L115298	u4310	m287	MERRICK	In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
L115297	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
L115296	u4310	m287	MERRICK	We'll cover it later.
L115295	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What?
L115294	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
L115293	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, him.
L115292	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
L115291	u4300	m287	BUFFY	A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
L115290	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
L115289	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Why do you keep saying that?
L115288	u4310	m287	MERRICK	There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
L115287	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What, um...  What do we do?
L115286	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Our purposes.
L115285	u4310	m287	MERRICK	It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
L115252	u4310	m287	MERRICK	It's true.
L115251	u4300	m287	BUFFY	They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
L115249	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Skip it.
L115248	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I have cheerleading squad.
L115247	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Meet me at this address after school.
L115246	u4300	m287	BUFFY	All right.
L115245	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
L115244	u4300	m287	BUFFY	She --
L115243	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Where's the other one?
L115240	u4310	m287	MERRICK	We wait for Robert to wake up.
L115239	u4300	m287	BUFFY	All right.  What do we do now?
L115238	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
L115237	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Wait a minute.
L115235	u4310	m287	MERRICK	This is it.
L115234	u4300	m287	BUFFY	None of your business.  God.
L115233	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Cramps?
L115232	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Ow.
L115231	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
L115230	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
L115229	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
L115228	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I have to show you.
L115227	u4300	m287	BUFFY	How do you know all this?
L115226	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Lothos.
L115225	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
L115224	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
L115223	u4310	m287	MERRICK	China.
L115222	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
L115221	u4310	m287	MERRICK	In Virginia.
L115220	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I was a slave.
L115219	u4310	m287	MERRICK	In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
L115218	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Everybody does.
L115217	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
L115216	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Just stay away from me, okay?
L115212	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
L115211	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
L115210	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Yes.
L115209	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
L115208	u4310	m287	MERRICK	To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
L115207	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Time to do what?
L115206	u4310	m287	MERRICK	You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
L115205	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
L115204	u4310	m287	MERRICK	You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
L115203	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
L115202	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Wait!
L115201	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
L115200	u4310	m287	MERRICK	You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
L115199	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
L115198	u4300	m287	BUFFY	My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
L115197	u4310	m287	MERRICK	To bring you... your birthright.
L115196	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Why?
L115195	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
L115194	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What are you talking about?
L115193	u4310	m287	MERRICK	Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
L115192	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Am I in trouble or something?
L115191	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I'm looking for you, actually.
L115190	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
L115189	u4310	m287	MERRICK	I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
L115188	u4300	m287	BUFFY	God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
L115703	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Oh.
L115702	u4311	m287	NICOLE	I haven't seen him tonight.
L115701	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
L115700	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Hi.
L115699	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Hi, guys.
L115660	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Later for it.
L115659	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Nicole...
L115658	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Well, I guess you got what you came for.
L115639	u4311	m287	NICOLE	You're having a fling with him?
L115638	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Pike.
L115550	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Sorry.
L115549	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
L115265	u4311	m287	NICOLE	You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
L115264	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Thanks.
L115263	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
L115187	u4300	m287	BUFFY	B'bye.
L115186	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
L115185	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
L115182	u4311	m287	NICOLE	I guess.
L115181	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Yeah... She's okay, though.
L115180	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Cassandra's really smart.
L115179	u4300	m287	BUFFY	You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
L115176	u4300	m287	BUFFY	How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
L115175	u4311	m287	NICOLE	I don't get it.
L115172	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
L115171	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Thank you very much.
L115170	u4300	m287	BUFFY	That is so cool.
L115157	u4311	m287	NICOLE	No.  It was mondo bizarro.
L115156	u4300	m287	BUFFY	I was just scared is all.
L115155	u4311	m287	NICOLE	-- like she's gonna kill me.
L115142	u4300	m287	BUFFY	What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
L115141	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Come one, that was so weird.
L115087	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
L115086	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
L114956	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Good enough!
L114955	u4300	m287	BUFFY	That's the plan.
L114954	u4311	m287	NICOLE	So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
L114942	u4311	m287	NICOLE	They don't even have Dolby.
L114941	u4300	m287	BUFFY	No THX.
L114930	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
L114929	u4311	m287	NICOLE	You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
L114928	u4300	m287	BUFFY	Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
L115282	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	Swear to God.
L115281	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	Really?
L115280	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
L115273	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
L115272	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	What... are you?
L115271	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
L115270	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	My parents have money...
L115269	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	So very much.
L115268	u4302	m287	CASSANDRA	What's happening?  What do you want?
L115267	u4308	m287	LOTHOS	I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
L114921	u4309	m287	MAN	You are much more.
L114920	u4303	m287	GIRL	I'm just a girl.
L114919	u4309	m287	MAN	But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
L114918	u4309	m287	MAN	Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
L114917	u4303	m287	GIRL	I don't understand.
L114916	u4309	m287	MAN	The mark of the Coven.
L114915	u4309	m287	MAN	She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
L114914	u4303	m287	GIRL	Why?  Why me?
L114913	u4309	m287	MAN	You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
L114912	u4303	m287	GIRL	I can't!
L115003	u4304	m287	GRUELLER	Good.
L115002	u4313	m287	WALLY	Got that.
L115001	u4304	m287	GRUELLER	Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
L115000	u4313	m287	WALLY	Could be.
L114999	u4304	m287	GRUELLER	You think so?
L114998	u4313	m287	WALLY	Could be.
L114997	u4304	m287	GRUELLER	What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
L114996	u4313	m287	WALLY	Hi, Grueller.
L114995	u4304	m287	GRUELLER	Bessel!  What are you doing here?
L115832	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	I heard she got straight A's.
L115831	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
L115783	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	But --
L115782	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Okay, let's go.
L115781	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	No --
L115780	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
L115779	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Jeffrey!
L115778	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Buffy?
L115776	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
L115775	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Oh, baby!
L115774	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Oh, yes!  Yes!
L115066	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Okay, what else?
L115065	u4305	m287	JEFFREY	Write that down.
L115830	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Buffy?
L115829	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
L115653	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Okay.
L115652	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	And Spring Fling.
L115620	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Throw it out.
L115619	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
L115426	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
L115425	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Well, I hope so.
L115424	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
L115144	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Where'd you learn how to do that?
L115143	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	I can't believe they still ate it.
L115632	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Does Jeffrey know?
L115631	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Cool!
L115566	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	What is she...
L115565	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Buffy!
L115178	u4311	m287	NICOLE	I gotta bail.  You coming?
L115177	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	I never thought of that.
L115154	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
L115153	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
L115152	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
L115151	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	You're kidding.
L115150	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
L115149	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	What happened?
L114940	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Nee sitch.  No way.
L114939	u4306	m287	JENNIFER	Omniplex?
L115754	u4312	m287	PIKE	You want some punch?
L115753	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	They'll kill us!
L115123	u4312	m287	PIKE	Hey, wait a minute...
L115122	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
L115121	u4312	m287	PIKE	I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
L115120	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Wit-tay.
L115119	u4312	m287	PIKE	The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
L115709	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
L115708	u4311	m287	NICOLE	It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
L115655	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
L115654	u4311	m287	NICOLE	And the January Semi-formal --
L115651	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Right.
L115650	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Except for Prom.
L115649	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
L115648	u4311	m287	NICOLE	So, we're stupid now?
L115644	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
L115643	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Like you've got a grip.
L115642	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Oh, thank you very much.
L115637	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
L115636	u4311	m287	NICOLE	What are you talking about?
L115623	u4311	m287	NICOLE	I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
L115622	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
L115621	u4311	m287	NICOLE	I really was way way too too.
L115159	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
L115158	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Buffy, the ape-woman.
L115110	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Nice much.
L115109	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Smell of booze much.
L115098	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Well, look who's here.
L115097	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
L115096	u4311	m287	NICOLE	If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
L115072	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Right!
L115071	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Oh, yeah!
L115061	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Okay.
L115060	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Environment.  That's cool with me.
L115040	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Oh, please.
L115039	u4311	m287	NICOLE	The homelesses?
L114970	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	Like we don't have rights too?
L114969	u4311	m287	NICOLE	God!  Take a chill lozenge.
L114963	u4307	m287	KIMBERLY	He is so bald.
L114962	u4311	m287	NICOLE	Oh, God.
L115464	u4312	m287	PIKE	Run.
L115463	u4314	m287	ZEPH	Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
L115462	u4312	m287	PIKE	I am.
L115461	u4314	m287	ZEPH	All right.  Take care of yourself.
L115460	u4312	m287	PIKE	I don't think so.
L115459	u4314	m287	ZEPH	Ah, you'll be coming back.
L115458	u4312	m287	PIKE	You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
L115457	u4314	m287	ZEPH	No...  You want me to give him a message?
L115456	u4312	m287	PIKE	Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
L115455	u4314	m287	ZEPH	Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
L115454	u4312	m287	PIKE	I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
L115453	u4314	m287	ZEPH	What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
L127158	u4436	m294	KILLER	Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
L127157	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	You do?
L127156	u4436	m294	KILLER	I think I know how to restore your reputation.
L127155	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
L127154	u4436	m294	KILLER	He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
L127153	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	Why?
L127152	u4436	m294	KILLER	I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
L127151	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	Yeah?
L127582	u4427	m294	BEN	Ok!
L127581	u4430	m294	CINDY	I get the imports.
L127580	u4427	m294	BEN	One more time.
L127542	u4430	m294	CINDY	Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
L127541	u4427	m294	BEN	That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
L127540	u4430	m294	CINDY	Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
L127539	u4427	m294	BEN	Not my imports.
L127538	u4430	m294	CINDY	I get all your CDs.
L127263	u4430	m294	CINDY	Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
L127262	u4427	m294	BEN	WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
L127261	u4430	m294	CINDY	ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
L127260	u4427	m294	BEN	You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
L127259	u4430	m294	CINDY	I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
L127120	u4427	m294	BEN	Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
L127119	u4430	m294	CINDY	I think it's funny.
L127108	u4427	m294	BEN	As fucking if.
L127107	u4430	m294	CINDY	If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
L127106	u4427	m294	BEN	Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
L127105	u4430	m294	CINDY	I never fucked Rod.
L127104	u4427	m294	BEN	What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
L127103	u4430	m294	CINDY	I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
L127102	u4427	m294	BEN	Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
L127288	u4448	m294	TOM	Calm down Brent.
L127287	u4428	m294	BRENT	I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
L127286	u4448	m294	TOM	That's impossible.
L127285	u4428	m294	BRENT	IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
L127201	u4428	m294	BRENT	Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
L127200	u4448	m294	TOM	You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
L127199	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
L127198	u4448	m294	TOM	Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
L127197	u4428	m294	BRENT	is there anything you do?
L127196	u4448	m294	TOM	Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
L127195	u4428	m294	BRENT	If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
L127076	u4448	m294	TOM	Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
L127075	u4428	m294	BRENT	So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
L127074	u4448	m294	TOM	So?
L127073	u4428	m294	BRENT	She's my daughter, Tom.
L127072	u4448	m294	TOM	The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
L127071	u4428	m294	BRENT	Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
L127061	u4428	m294	BRENT	I just wanted to check that you were okay?
L127060	u4448	m294	TOM	Hi Jody.
L127057	u4448	m294	TOM	Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
L127056	u4428	m294	BRENT	But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
L127055	u4448	m294	TOM	Good.
L127054	u4428	m294	BRENT	No.
L127053	u4448	m294	TOM	You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
L127615	u4428	m294	BRENT	Run!
L127614	u4434	m294	JODY	No!
L127294	u4428	m294	BRENT	Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
L127293	u4434	m294	JODY	Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
L127292	u4428	m294	BRENT	What did you hear?
L127291	u4434	m294	JODY	No I wasn't.
L127290	u4428	m294	BRENT	You were eavesdropping.
L127284	u4428	m294	BRENT	Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
L127283	u4434	m294	JODY	Who is she Daddy?
L127282	u4428	m294	BRENT	It can't be.
L127281	u4434	m294	JODY	You know her?
L127249	u4434	m294	JODY	She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
L127248	u4428	m294	BRENT	Are you sure?
L127247	u4434	m294	JODY	It was a she.
L127190	u4428	m294	BRENT	I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
L127189	u4434	m294	JODY	I thought you'd be pleased.
L127188	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm not.
L127187	u4434	m294	JODY	You are upset.
L127186	u4428	m294	BRENT	No honey.
L127185	u4434	m294	JODY	Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
L127184	u4428	m294	BRENT	Ok.
L127182	u4428	m294	BRENT	You never went, uh, all the way?
L127181	u4434	m294	JODY	Not much further.
L127180	u4428	m294	BRENT	I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
L127179	u4434	m294	JODY	Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
L127178	u4428	m294	BRENT	How much further?
L127177	u4434	m294	JODY	A little.
L127176	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
L127175	u4434	m294	JODY	Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
L127174	u4428	m294	BRENT	Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
L127173	u4434	m294	JODY	What do you mean?
L127170	u4428	m294	BRENT	I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
L127169	u4434	m294	JODY	What's wrong?
L127168	u4428	m294	BRENT	Hi honey.
L127068	u4434	m294	JODY	I will. Is that all?
L127067	u4428	m294	BRENT	I want you to head right home after school.
L127066	u4434	m294	JODY	No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
L127065	u4428	m294	BRENT	Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
L127064	u4434	m294	JODY	I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
L127063	u4428	m294	BRENT	How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
L127062	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
L127059	u4434	m294	JODY	Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
L127058	u4428	m294	BRENT	Hi honey.
L127032	u4428	m294	BRENT	They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
L127031	u4434	m294	JODY	Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
L127030	u4428	m294	BRENT	You said that two weeks ago.
L127029	u4434	m294	JODY	It won't happen again.
L127028	u4428	m294	BRENT	Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
L127027	u4434	m294	JODY	What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
L127026	u4428	m294	BRENT	You're grounded Friday night!
L127025	u4434	m294	JODY	Daddy you scared me!
L127024	u4428	m294	BRENT	It's almost ten o'clock.
L127404	u4428	m294	BRENT	I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
L127403	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	We're seeing all the signs in town.
L127402	u4428	m294	BRENT	Are you sure?
L127401	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Should we close down any eruption?
L127400	u4428	m294	BRENT	No?
L127399	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
L127392	u4428	m294	BRENT	No. I'll handle this.
L127391	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	We need you here. I can bring her in.
L127390	u4428	m294	BRENT	There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
L127389	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	You found her?
L127041	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
L127040	u4428	m294	BRENT	What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
L127252	u4428	m294	BRENT	She's underage.
L127251	u4438	m294	MARGE	This will relax her.
L127250	u4428	m294	BRENT	What are you doing?
L127194	u4428	m294	BRENT	No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
L127193	u4438	m294	MARGE	Did you warn her?
L127192	u4428	m294	BRENT	She's still a virgin.
L127191	u4438	m294	MARGE	Well?
L127166	u4438	m294	MARGE	She just turned off her light.
L127165	u4428	m294	BRENT	Is Jody still awake?
L127038	u4428	m294	BRENT	Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
L127037	u4438	m294	MARGE	What happened?
L127491	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
L127490	u4428	m294	BRENT	Why?
L127489	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	Yeah. You should check downstairs.
L127488	u4428	m294	BRENT	Really?
L127487	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
L127486	u4428	m294	BRENT	No, you couldn't.
L127485	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
L127484	u4428	m294	BRENT	No.
L127483	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
L127482	u4428	m294	BRENT	Is there a picture of her somewhere?
L127479	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
L127478	u4428	m294	BRENT	I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
L127477	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I can.
L127476	u4428	m294	BRENT	Can you get inside?
L127475	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
L127474	u4428	m294	BRENT	Can you describe her? How old was she?
L127473	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
L127472	u4428	m294	BRENT	She was murdered?
L127471	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	A bullet to the right cerebellum.
L127470	u4428	m294	BRENT	Of what?
L127469	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
L127468	u4428	m294	BRENT	She works at a church?
L127467	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	St. Michael's.
L127466	u4428	m294	BRENT	You know where I can find her?
L127465	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	She's not here.
L127464	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
L127463	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	Hello?
L127525	u4431	m294	DAD	No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
L127524	u4445	m294	SANDY	You're not?
L127523	u4431	m294	DAD	Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
L127522	u4445	m294	SANDY	Daddy....
L127521	u4431	m294	DAD	Your brother told us.
L127519	u4431	m294	DAD	I know where you're going.
L127633	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
L127632	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	But I shouldn't shut it down?
L127630	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	Ok.
L127629	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
L127628	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
L127627	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Jesus. Any word from Brent?
L127626	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
L127625	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Who's?
L127624	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	We just found another body.
L127665	u4433	m294	JIMMY	I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
L127664	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
L127662	u4433	m294	JIMMY	I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
L127661	u4437	m294	LEONARD	I'm sure you should have failed.
L127660	u4433	m294	JIMMY	You gave me a 'D'.
L127659	u4437	m294	LEONARD	What?
L127658	u4433	m294	JIMMY	You fucked me up!
L127655	u4433	m294	JIMMY	What are you doing here?
L127654	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Pay no attention to me.
L127675	u4437	m294	LEONARD	You think you're my sister?
L127674	u4434	m294	JODY	Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
L127573	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
L127572	u4434	m294	JODY	You're the killed.
L127571	u4437	m294	LEONARD	I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
L127570	u4434	m294	JODY	Yes.
L127569	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
L127568	u4434	m294	JODY	_ Your father raped someone?
L127567	u4437	m294	LEONARD	He's a rapist. Like mine.
L127566	u4434	m294	JODY	What do you know about my father?
L127565	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
L127564	u4434	m294	JODY	Me? Why me?
L127563	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
L127562	u4434	m294	JODY	Really?
L127561	u4437	m294	LEONARD	We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
L127559	u4437	m294	LEONARD	I really do. For your own safety.
L127558	u4434	m294	JODY	You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
L127557	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Then you should go.
L127556	u4434	m294	JODY	Of course I'm scared.
L127555	u4437	m294	LEONARD	of COURSE. You're not scared?
L127554	u4434	m294	JODY	You know about that too?
L127553	u4437	m294	LEONARD	You aren't going to the party?
L127552	u4434	m294	JODY	Sure.
L127551	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Can you just follow me? The back is full?
L127550	u4434	m294	JODY	Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
L127549	u4437	m294	LEONARD	My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
L127548	u4434	m294	JODY	I am.
L127315	u4445	m294	SANDY	Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
L127314	u4434	m294	JODY	I can't right now.
L127313	u4445	m294	SANDY	Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
L127312	u4434	m294	JODY	Stag?
L127311	u4445	m294	SANDY	I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
L127310	u4434	m294	JODY	Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
L127309	u4445	m294	SANDY	Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
L127308	u4434	m294	JODY	You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
L127307	u4445	m294	SANDY	It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
L127306	u4434	m294	JODY	I won't.
L127305	u4445	m294	SANDY	Especially not your dad.
L127304	u4434	m294	JODY	Ok.
L127303	u4445	m294	SANDY	You can't tell your parents.
L127302	u4434	m294	JODY	No.
L127301	u4445	m294	SANDY	Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
L127300	u4434	m294	JODY	What party?
L127299	u4445	m294	SANDY	Mark invited me to the party.
L127298	u4434	m294	JODY	What?
L127297	u4445	m294	SANDY	Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
L127296	u4434	m294	JODY	FINE. Are you?
L127295	u4445	m294	SANDY	You ok?
L127255	u4445	m294	SANDY	The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
L127254	u4434	m294	JODY	Someone tried to kill me.
L127230	u4434	m294	JODY	NO?!
L127229	u4445	m294	SANDY	You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
L127228	u4434	m294	JODY	Not that many.
L127227	u4445	m294	SANDY	There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
L127226	u4434	m294	JODY	Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
L127149	u4445	m294	SANDY	OK. increase the peace.
L127148	u4434	m294	JODY	I promised I'd go right home after school.
L127147	u4445	m294	SANDY	I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
L127146	u4434	m294	JODY	How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
L127145	u4445	m294	SANDY	Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
L127144	u4434	m294	JODY	I don't know what I'm so scared of.
L127143	u4445	m294	SANDY	That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
L127142	u4434	m294	JODY	You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
L127141	u4445	m294	SANDY	No!
L127140	u4434	m294	JODY	Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
L127139	u4445	m294	SANDY	Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
L127138	u4434	m294	JODY	He says he loves me.
L127137	u4445	m294	SANDY	Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
L127136	u4434	m294	JODY	I was desperate. It was gross.
L127135	u4445	m294	SANDY	Oh nice save.
L127131	u4445	m294	SANDY	I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
L127130	u4434	m294	JODY	Does she fuck?
L127129	u4445	m294	SANDY	He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
L127128	u4434	m294	JODY	But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
L127127	u4445	m294	SANDY	You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
L127126	u4434	m294	JODY	You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
L127125	u4445	m294	SANDY	You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
L127124	u4434	m294	JODY	You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
L127123	u4445	m294	SANDY	What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
L127095	u4434	m294	JODY	You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
L127094	u4445	m294	SANDY	No! That's his table.
L127092	u4445	m294	SANDY	Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
L127091	u4434	m294	JODY	You eventually have to talk to him.
L127090	u4445	m294	SANDY	The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
L127089	u4434	m294	JODY	You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
L127088	u4445	m294	SANDY	I don't watch him eat everyday.
L127087	u4434	m294	JODY	Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
L127086	u4445	m294	SANDY	Why?
L127085	u4434	m294	JODY	Mark Shale.
L127084	u4445	m294	SANDY	Who?
L127083	u4434	m294	JODY	Go sit next to him.
L127419	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
L127418	u4434	m294	JODY	No.
L127417	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
L127416	u4434	m294	JODY	You Miss Dunlop?
L127415	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
L127414	u4434	m294	JODY	Don't you think it's sick?
L127413	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
L127412	u4434	m294	JODY	You heard about that?
L127411	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Everyone's getting ready for the party.
L127410	u4434	m294	JODY	This place is empty.
L127409	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Follow me.
L127408	u4434	m294	JODY	Twenty eight years ago.
L127407	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
L127406	u4434	m294	JODY	Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
L127405	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
L127648	u4435	m294	KENNY	Pretend we're just another couple.
L127647	u4434	m294	JODY	What are you doing?
L127644	u4435	m294	KENNY	Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
L127643	u4434	m294	JODY	Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
L127635	u4435	m294	KENNY	I love you.
L127634	u4434	m294	JODY	Thanks for coming back for me.
L127621	u4435	m294	KENNY	Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
L127620	u4434	m294	JODY	Go to the police station!
L127617	u4435	m294	KENNY	He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
L127616	u4434	m294	JODY	My dad's down there!
L127518	u4434	m294	JODY	Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
L127517	u4435	m294	KENNY	I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
L127516	u4434	m294	JODY	What?
L127515	u4435	m294	KENNY	Jody. Wait.
L127514	u4434	m294	JODY	This party is sick.
L127513	u4435	m294	KENNY	Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
L127512	u4435	m294	KENNY	Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
L127511	u4434	m294	JODY	And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
L127510	u4435	m294	KENNY	Sharon's far from a slut.
L127509	u4434	m294	JODY	You flaunt some slut in my face.
L127508	u4435	m294	KENNY	That's not why we broke up.
L127507	u4434	m294	JODY	You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
L127506	u4435	m294	KENNY	Yeah.
L127505	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm making you feel like meat?
L127504	u4435	m294	KENNY	Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
L127503	u4434	m294	JODY	What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
L127501	u4434	m294	JODY	Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
L127500	u4435	m294	KENNY	Are you coming to the party?
L127499	u4435	m294	KENNY	I don't know. I kind of am.
L127498	u4434	m294	JODY	So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
L127497	u4435	m294	KENNY	But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
L127496	u4434	m294	JODY	I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
L127495	u4435	m294	KENNY	I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
L127494	u4434	m294	JODY	My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
L127493	u4435	m294	KENNY	All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
L127363	u4435	m294	KENNY	Yes!
L127362	u4434	m294	JODY	I'll think about it.
L127361	u4435	m294	KENNY	They're not picking me up until six.
L127360	u4434	m294	JODY	I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
L127359	u4435	m294	KENNY	I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
L127358	u4434	m294	JODY	I do not.
L127357	u4435	m294	KENNY	Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
L127356	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm not using him as an excuse.
L127355	u4435	m294	KENNY	If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
L127354	u4434	m294	JODY	No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
L127353	u4435	m294	KENNY	Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
L127352	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
L127351	u4435	m294	KENNY	You know I want to go with you.
L127350	u4434	m294	JODY	Did Sharon say no?
L127349	u4435	m294	KENNY	Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
L127348	u4434	m294	JODY	Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
L127347	u4435	m294	KENNY	Why?
L127346	u4434	m294	JODY	Yeah. I think it's really sick.
L127345	u4435	m294	KENNY	I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
L127344	u4434	m294	JODY	I did.
L127343	u4435	m294	KENNY	I heard you got attacked.
L127342	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm fine.
L127341	u4435	m294	KENNY	Are you O.K.?
L127023	u4435	m294	KENNY	Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
L127022	u4434	m294	JODY	What?
L127021	u4435	m294	KENNY	You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
L127019	u4435	m294	KENNY	Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
L127018	u4434	m294	JODY	I got to get home.
L127017	u4435	m294	KENNY	So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
L127016	u4434	m294	JODY	I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
L127015	u4435	m294	KENNY	Why?
L127014	u4434	m294	JODY	Cut it out.
L127461	u4434	m294	JODY	NO!
L127460	u4438	m294	MARGE	Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
L127459	u4434	m294	JODY	THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
L127456	u4434	m294	JODY	Who was the fourth?
L127455	u4438	m294	MARGE	Yes.
L127454	u4434	m294	JODY	The principal?
L127453	u4438	m294	MARGE	Mr. Sisler was one of them.
L127452	u4434	m294	JODY	You're not telling me something.
L127451	u4438	m294	MARGE	Two men left town right after it happened.
L127450	u4434	m294	JODY	The men. Do any of them still live around here?
L127449	u4438	m294	MARGE	Who?
L127448	u4434	m294	JODY	Who were they?
L127447	u4438	m294	MARGE	I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
L127446	u4434	m294	JODY	The word is Mob.
L127445	u4438	m294	MARGE	I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
L127444	u4434	m294	JODY	How could you?
L127443	u4438	m294	MARGE	EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
L127442	u4434	m294	JODY	And the police did nothing?
L127441	u4438	m294	MARGE	They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
L127440	u4434	m294	JODY	People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
L127439	u4438	m294	MARGE	They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
L127438	u4434	m294	JODY	Why not?
L127437	u4438	m294	MARGE	No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
L127436	u4434	m294	JODY	You didn't believe her?
L127435	u4438	m294	MARGE	She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
L127434	u4434	m294	JODY	Attacked how?
L127433	u4438	m294	MARGE	Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
L127432	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
L127431	u4438	m294	MARGE	What?
L127430	u4434	m294	JODY	Wait.
L127427	u4438	m294	MARGE	Don't make me order you.
L127426	u4434	m294	JODY	Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
L127425	u4438	m294	MARGE	She's nobody you should be concerned with.
L127424	u4434	m294	JODY	Who is she?
L127423	u4438	m294	MARGE	I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
L127387	u4434	m294	JODY	The library. I'll be fine.
L127386	u4438	m294	MARGE	Where are you going?
L127385	u4438	m294	MARGE	Not that I know of.
L127384	u4434	m294	JODY	No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
L127383	u4438	m294	MARGE	I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
L127382	u4434	m294	JODY	No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
L127381	u4438	m294	MARGE	Did he say anything else about her?
L127380	u4434	m294	JODY	That's what he said.
L127379	u4438	m294	MARGE	What?
L127378	u4434	m294	JODY	I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
L127377	u4438	m294	MARGE	I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
L127376	u4434	m294	JODY	Yeah. Who is she?
L127375	u4438	m294	MARGE	Lisa Sherman?
L127374	u4434	m294	JODY	Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
L127373	u4438	m294	MARGE	You can ask me anything.
L127372	u4434	m294	JODY	I need to ask you something.
L127371	u4438	m294	MARGE	Yes?
L127370	u4434	m294	JODY	Mom?
L127369	u4438	m294	MARGE	Hi princess.
L127368	u4434	m294	JODY	Hi mom.
L127245	u4434	m294	JODY	His mother's an only child.
L127244	u4436	m294	KILLER	His mother's side.
L127243	u4434	m294	JODY	On what side of the family?
L127242	u4436	m294	KILLER	Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
L127241	u4434	m294	JODY	Kenny's aunt?
L127240	u4436	m294	KILLER	I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
L127239	u4434	m294	JODY	Yeah.
L127238	u4436	m294	KILLER	Are you Jody?
L127237	u4434	m294	JODY	Yes?
L127591	u4435	m294	KENNY	I'm worried about someone.
L127590	u4446	m294	SHARON	What?
L127589	u4435	m294	KENNY	I got to go.
L127588	u4446	m294	SHARON	What are you doing?
L127587	u4446	m294	SHARON	I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
L127586	u4435	m294	KENNY	There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
L127585	u4446	m294	SHARON	What?
L127584	u4435	m294	KENNY	Just thinking about something.
L127583	u4446	m294	SHARON	You ok?
L127577	u4445	m294	SANDY	You're the one who's hand is shaking.
L127576	u4439	m294	MARK	Now don't be nervous.
L127575	u4445	m294	SANDY	So are you.
L127574	u4439	m294	MARK	You're so beautiful.
L127276	u4445	m294	SANDY	No, you keep one.
L127275	u4439	m294	MARK	You can have both if you want.
L127273	u4439	m294	MARK	They're tasty.
L127272	u4445	m294	SANDY	Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
L127271	u4439	m294	MARK	Did you want one?
L127270	u4445	m294	SANDY	You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
L127265	u4439	m294	MARK	Hi Sandy.
L127264	u4445	m294	SANDY	Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
L127116	u4445	m294	SANDY	And she didn't?
L127115	u4439	m294	MARK	Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
L127579	u4441	m294	NERD 1	Told you to hide it.
L127578	u4442	m294	NERD 2	Hey! That was a 3k machine.
L127533	u4442	m294	NERD 2	I'm not leaving it here.
L127532	u4441	m294	NERD 1	You can't bring it.
L127531	u4442	m294	NERD 2	No.
L127530	u4441	m294	NERD 1	Hide your laptop here.
L127529	u4442	m294	NERD 2	Ok.
L127528	u4441	m294	NERD 1	There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
L127012	u4447	m294	STACY	ROD!
L127011	u4444	m294	ROD	Stacy?
L127002	u4444	m294	ROD	Yes. Unfair to me.
L127001	u4447	m294	STACY	Unfair?!
L127000	u4444	m294	ROD	You're being unfair.
L126999	u4447	m294	STACY	Rod!
L126997	u4447	m294	STACY	I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
L126996	u4444	m294	ROD	Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
L126995	u4447	m294	STACY	I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
L126994	u4444	m294	ROD	That wasn't me ...
L126993	u4447	m294	STACY	If sheep don't count.
L126992	u4444	m294	ROD	On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
L126991	u4447	m294	STACY	Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
L126990	u4444	m294	ROD	Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
L126989	u4447	m294	STACY	What?
L126988	u4444	m294	ROD	Let me just ask you a serious question first.
L126987	u4447	m294	STACY	Maybe you better just drive me home.
L126986	u4444	m294	ROD	Maybe it won't stay in.
L126984	u4444	m294	ROD	But you don't really mean it.
L126983	u4447	m294	STACY	I said no.
L151064	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
L151063	u4718	m313	ALICE	How?
L151062	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
L151056	u4718	m313	ALICE	I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
L151055	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	What do you mean?
L151054	u4718	m313	ALICE	Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
L151024	u4718	m313	ALICE	It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year ? St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
L151023	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
L151022	u4718	m313	ALICE	I love the smell of pine.
L150973	u4718	m313	ALICE	No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
L150972	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Does she go up to the Farren's often?
L150784	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	But quite harmless, I'm sure.
L150783	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
L150782	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
L150769	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday ? about Oliver's first marriage ? and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy ? although he'll never realize it.
L150768	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
L150767	u4718	m313	ALICE	We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
L150766	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	But you don't keep a cat, do you?
L150765	u4718	m313	ALICE	But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
L150761	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
L150760	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
L150756	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
L150755	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, hello.
L150556	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	I'd love to.
L150555	u4718	m313	ALICE	I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
L150524	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
L150523	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
L150971	u4718	m313	ALICE	All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
L150970	u4719	m313	AMY	But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
L150969	u4718	m313	ALICE	Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
L150968	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
L150913	u4719	m313	AMY	You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
L150912	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, thank you, darling.
L150858	u4719	m313	AMY	All right, mommy.
L150857	u4718	m313	ALICE	Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
L150856	u4719	m313	AMY	Irena.
L150855	u4718	m313	ALICE	Irena.
L150854	u4719	m313	AMY	What's her name?
L150853	u4718	m313	ALICE	She was very pretty.
L150852	u4719	m313	AMY	It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
L150851	u4718	m313	ALICE	Where'd you get this, darling?
L150847	u4719	m313	AMY	I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
L150846	u4718	m313	ALICE	Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
L150739	u4718	m313	ALICE	Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
L150738	u4719	m313	AMY	But it's already come true.
L150737	u4718	m313	ALICE	You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
L150736	u4719	m313	AMY	I got my wish anyway.
L150735	u4718	m313	ALICE	Well ? the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
L150734	u4718	m313	ALICE	I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
L150733	u4719	m313	AMY	Are they nice?
L150732	u4718	m313	ALICE	No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
L150731	u4719	m313	AMY	Do you know the people?
L150730	u4718	m313	ALICE	The Farren house
L150729	u4719	m313	AMY	On the back street ? a green house
L150728	u4718	m313	ALICE	Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
L150727	u4719	m313	AMY	At the old house with the voice.
L150726	u4718	m313	ALICE	But where did you get it, Amy?
L150725	u4719	m313	AMY	That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
L150724	u4718	m313	ALICE	Where did you get this ring?
L150723	u4719	m313	AMY	I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
L150722	u4718	m313	ALICE	Sometimes.
L150721	u4719	m313	AMY	Did your wishes ever come true?
L150720	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, lots of times.
L150719	u4719	m313	AMY	Did you ever make a wish?
L150718	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes, darling.
L150717	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy --
L150716	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, you'll remember it some time.
L150715	u4719	m313	AMY	The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
L150714	u4718	m313	ALICE	What song, dear?
L150712	u4718	m313	ALICE	I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
L150711	u4719	m313	AMY	I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
L150710	u4718	m313	ALICE	What are saying, darling?
L150616	u4719	m313	AMY	I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself ? tell the truth --
L150615	u4718	m313	ALICE	But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
L150613	u4719	m313	AMY	You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
L150612	u4718	m313	ALICE	You get your wish!
L151035	u4726	m313	OLIVER	We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
L151034	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
L150896	u4726	m313	OLIVER	That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
L150895	u4718	m313	ALICE	What's funny?
L150864	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I suppose so.
L150863	u4718	m313	ALICE	Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
L150862	u4718	m313	ALICE	Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
L150861	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where did you get it?
L150849	u4718	m313	ALICE	Well, you know where it is.
L150848	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I haven't had my breakfast.
L150845	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
L150844	u4718	m313	ALICE	It's your play.
L150843	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What?
L150842	u4718	m313	ALICE	Ollie.
L150839	u4718	m313	ALICE	I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
L150838	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What is it, Alice?
L150691	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
L150690	u4718	m313	ALICE	You're shouting at me.
L150689	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm never unfair.
L150688	u4718	m313	ALICE	You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
L150687	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Well, it seemed to me --
L150686	u4718	m313	ALICE	Did you hear the child out?
L150683	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy's been lying again.
L150682	u4718	m313	ALICE	My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
L150588	u4718	m313	ALICE	But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
L150587	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
L150586	u4718	m313	ALICE	What do you mean?
L150585	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Something's haywire,
L150584	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's right.
L150583	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I think I should.  3000W?
L150582	u4718	m313	ALICE	All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
L150581	u4726	m313	OLIVER	No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
L150580	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
L150579	u4718	m313	ALICE	Times have changed.
L150578	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
L150577	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes, darling,
L150576	u4726	m313	OLIVER	It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
L150575	u4718	m313	ALICE	It's early yet.
L150574	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where is everybody?
L150573	u4718	m313	ALICE	I forgot I had it on.
L150572	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
L150552	u4718	m313	ALICE	Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
L150551	u4726	m313	OLIVER	"You make me sound like the father in ""East Lynne."""
L150550	u4718	m313	ALICE	I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today ? let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
L150549	u4726	m313	OLIVER	No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
L150548	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
L150547	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I know that.
L150546	u4718	m313	ALICE	I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
L150545	u4726	m313	OLIVER	All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
L150544	u4718	m313	ALICE	She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
L150543	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'd hate her to grow up like that.
L150541	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
L150540	u4718	m313	ALICE	I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
L150539	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
L150781	u4718	m313	ALICE	You do that, Edward.
L150780	u4721	m313	EDWARD	She said something about that, Mrs. Reed ? but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
L150779	u4718	m313	ALICE	But I told her to go with you.
L150778	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
L150777	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's the Farren house.
L150776	u4721	m313	EDWARD	No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
L150775	u4718	m313	ALICE	I thought you were with Amy.
L150967	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
L150966	u4719	m313	AMY	I got lots of presents.
L150752	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
L150751	u4719	m313	AMY	I live right here.
L150750	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
L150749	u4719	m313	AMY	Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
L150748	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Hello, Amy.
L150535	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
L150534	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
L150533	u4719	m313	AMY	It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
L151150	u4719	m313	AMY	Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
L151149	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Yes, darling.
L151148	u4719	m313	AMY	Daddy?
L151138	u4719	m313	AMY	She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
L151137	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But there's no one here, darling.
L151136	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
L151049	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
L151048	u4719	m313	AMY	But...
L151047	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
L151046	u4719	m313	AMY	But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
L151045	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
L151044	u4719	m313	AMY	Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
L151043	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
L151042	u4719	m313	AMY	She's there, just like I said she'd be.
L151038	u4719	m313	AMY	She's there whenever I call her!
L151037	u4726	m313	OLIVER	In the garden? Would she be there now?
L151036	u4719	m313	AMY	It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
L151033	u4719	m313	AMY	Because she is my friend.
L151032	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
L151030	u4719	m313	AMY	Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
L151029	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Yes, Amy?
L151028	u4719	m313	AMY	Daddy!
L150920	u4726	m313	OLIVER	This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
L150919	u4719	m313	AMY	She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
L150918	u4726	m313	OLIVER	And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
L150917	u4719	m313	AMY	Just you wait!
L150911	u4726	m313	OLIVER	"This one says, ""To Mother from Amy."""
L150910	u4719	m313	AMY	These are all from me.
L150693	u4719	m313	AMY	You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
L150692	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
L150685	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Voices from an old dark house!
L150684	u4719	m313	AMY	No, I didn't.
L150681	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Let me be the judge of that.
L150680	u4719	m313	AMY	Daddy, it's true.
L150679	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories ? I'm sick of this sort of thing.
L150678	u4719	m313	AMY	It was just a voice.
L150677	u4726	m313	OLIVER	And who did the voice belong to?
L150676	u4719	m313	AMY	It's true.
L150675	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Now Amy
L150674	u4719	m313	AMY	I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
L150673	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Why didn't you run after them?
L150672	u4719	m313	AMY	They ran away.
L150671	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
L150670	u4719	m313	AMY	It was on account of the birthday party.
L150669	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
L150668	u4719	m313	AMY	But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
L150667	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Can't you tell me later?
L150666	u4719	m313	AMY	I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
L150665	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What do you want. Amy?
L150611	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But this is different.  Go on blow,
L150610	u4719	m313	AMY	But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
L150609	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Certain wishes do.
L150608	u4719	m313	AMY	But wishes don't come true.
L150607	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
L150602	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
L150601	u4719	m313	AMY	I didn't forget.
L150600	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
L150599	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, daddy.
L150598	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, not that old tree!
L150597	u4719	m313	AMY	I'll show you.
L150596	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where did you mail them?
L150595	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, I did.
L150594	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Did you mail then?
L150593	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, daddy.
L150592	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
L150567	u4726	m313	OLIVER	You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
L150566	u4719	m313	AMY	Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
L150940	u4719	m313	AMY	Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
L150939	u4723	m313	LOIS	We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
L150938	u4719	m313	AMY	No.
L150937	u4723	m313	LOIS	My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
L150936	u4719	m313	AMY	I don't know yet.
L150935	u4723	m313	LOIS	What'd you get for Christmas?
L151131	u4722	m313	IRENA	Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
L151130	u4719	m313	AMY	But why?
L151129	u4722	m313	IRENA	Yes, Amy.
L151128	u4719	m313	AMY	You?
L151127	u4722	m313	IRENA	But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
L151126	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
L151125	u4722	m313	IRENA	Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
L151124	u4719	m313	AMY	But she's dead!
L151123	u4722	m313	IRENA	You mustn't be afraid.
L151122	u4719	m313	AMY	She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
L151121	u4722	m313	IRENA	Don't cry, Amy.
L151120	u4719	m313	AMY	It's you...Irena...my friend!
L150984	u4719	m313	AMY	I want to touch it.
L150983	u4722	m313	IRENA	It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
L150982	u4719	m313	AMY	May I pet the deer?
L150981	u4722	m313	IRENA	It's a warm breath -- warm and strong ? warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
L150980	u4719	m313	AMY	I can sea its breath in the cold.
L150979	u4722	m313	IRENA	Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
L150978	u4719	m313	AMY	It stands so still.
L150977	u4722	m313	IRENA	You wanted to share this moment with me.
L150976	u4719	m313	AMY	So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
L150964	u4722	m313	IRENA	A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
L150963	u4719	m313	AMY	Merry Christmas.
L150959	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, please!
L150958	u4722	m313	IRENA	You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
L150957	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
L150956	u4722	m313	IRENA	I shall wear it in my hair!
L150955	u4719	m313	AMY	It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
L150954	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh, how beautiful!
L150953	u4719	m313	AMY	You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
L150952	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh, thank you, Amy.
L150951	u4719	m313	AMY	Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
L150908	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
L150907	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
L150906	u4722	m313	IRENA	All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
L150905	u4719	m313	AMY	My dolls. We can pretend.
L150904	u4722	m313	IRENA	Your children?
L150903	u4719	m313	AMY	No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
L150901	u4722	m313	IRENA	Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt

L150898	u4719	m313	AMY	That one's an elm.
L150897	u4722	m313	IRENA	There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
L150894	u4722	m313	IRENA	Of course,
L150893	u4719	m313	AMY	This is more fun than just pretend.
L150892	u4722	m313	IRENA	That's right!
L150891	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, yes! I see Prince,
L150890	u4722	m313	IRENA	Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
L150889	u4719	m313	AMY	A princess?
L150888	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
L150887	u4719	m313	AMY	The numbers simply don't mean anything
L150886	u4722	m313	IRENA	But you must!
L150885	u4719	m313	AMY	I'll just never learn arithmetic.
L150884	u4722	m313	IRENA	Can't you get it, darling?
L150883	u4722	m313	IRENA	Whenever you want.
L150882	u4719	m313	AMY	You'll always play with me?
L150881	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
L150880	u4722	m313	IRENA	No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
L150879	u4719	m313	AMY	Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
L150878	u4722	m313	IRENA	For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
L150877	u4719	m313	AMY	I shall want you for always.
L150876	u4722	m313	IRENA	For as long as you'll let me.
L150875	u4719	m313	AMY	Will you be friend for always?
L150874	u4722	m313	IRENA	I can not tell you.
L150873	u4719	m313	AMY	But where is that?
L150872	u4722	m313	IRENA	You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
L150871	u4719	m313	AMY	But where do you come from?
L150870	u4722	m313	IRENA	I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
L150869	u4719	m313	AMY	I've wanted a friend.
L150868	u4722	m313	IRENA	I'm your friend.
L150867	u4719	m313	AMY	Irena. But who are you?
L150866	u4722	m313	IRENA	You called me by my name.
L150865	u4719	m313	AMY	Who are you?
L151020	u4719	m313	AMY	But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
L151019	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It got hit.
L151018	u4719	m313	AMY	But it was alive ? it was fast and strong!
L151017	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Because it can't. It's dead.
L151016	u4719	m313	AMY	Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
L151015	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
L151014	u4719	m313	AMY	But what happened to the little deer?
L151013	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Bad luck to see death in the snow.
L151012	u4719	m313	AMY	But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
L151011	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
L150986	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
L150985	u4719	m313	AMY	There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
L150830	u4721	m313	EDWARD	But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
L150829	u4719	m313	AMY	But she's such a nice lady.
L150828	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
L150813	u4719	m313	AMY	But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
L150812	u4721	m313	EDWARD	About time for you to come home, Amy.
L150747	u4719	m313	AMY	That means I can go alone?
L150746	u4721	m313	EDWARD	I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
L150745	u4719	m313	AMY	You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
L150744	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Soon as I finish.
L150743	u4719	m313	AMY	Will you come soon?
L150742	u4721	m313	EDWARD	You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
L150741	u4719	m313	AMY	But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
L150740	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
L150708	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
L150707	u4719	m313	AMY	I wasn't singing to myself.
L150697	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Let me take another look at that ring.
L150696	u4719	m313	AMY	I'm trying to.
L150695	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
L150658	u4721	m313	EDWARD	That's the clever way to do it.
L150657	u4719	m313	AMY	Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
L150656	u4721	m313	EDWARD	They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
L150655	u4719	m313	AMY	the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
L150654	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
L150653	u4719	m313	AMY	A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
L150652	u4721	m313	EDWARD	I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
L150651	u4719	m313	AMY	It's a pretty ring.
L150650	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
L150649	u4719	m313	AMY	A lady threw it to me.
L150648	u4721	m313	EDWARD	That's a fine-looking ring.
L150647	u4719	m313	AMY	Look at my ring.
L150559	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
L150558	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.

L151109	u4719	m313	AMY	Hide me? Why?
L151005	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
L151004	u4719	m313	AMY	And does he kill people?
L151002	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Don't you read Shakespeare?

L150794	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me ? always!
L150792	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
L150791	u4719	m313	AMY	But I only came to give back the ring.
L150790	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days ? those beautiful, shilling, golden days.

L150786	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.

L151089	u4720	m313	BARBARA	And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
L151088	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
L151087	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
L151086	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Anybody could know that song.
L151085	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
L151076	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
L151075	u4720	m313	BARBARA	But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
L151074	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
L151073	u4720	m313	BARBARA	I hate the storm. I hate it!
L151010	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	My daughter died long ago.
L151009	u4720	m313	BARBARA	You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
L150834	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Look at me.
L150833	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
L151007	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
L151006	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
L150999	u4721	m313	EDWARD	What is it, ma'am?
L150996	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Wait a minute. Listen.
L150995	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
L150991	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	That's from her -- that woman.
L150990	u4721	m313	EDWARD	There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
L150822	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Come away, Amy.
L150821	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
L150820	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
L150819	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	On the dark nights ? on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
L150815	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Now, I don't know Amy --
L150814	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Let the child stay.
L150916	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
L150915	u4726	m313	OLIVER	"To Daddy from Amy. Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, ""To Edward from Amy.""."
L150706	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
L150705	u4726	m313	OLIVER	That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
L150704	u4721	m313	EDWARD	I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
L150702	u4721	m313	EDWARD	So do I, Mr. Reed.
L150701	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I like to see her happy.
L150700	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Amy looks happy ? seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
L150591	u4721	m313	EDWARD	She pleaded so to do it
L150590	u4726	m313	OLIVER	And Amy mailed them?
L150589	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
L150569	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Go on -- out with you.
L150568	u4721	m313	EDWARD	You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
L150565	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
L150564	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
L150563	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
L150562	u4721	m313	EDWARD	When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
L150561	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
L150560	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
L151066	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
L151065	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
L151060	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
L151059	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
L151058	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
L151057	u4726	m313	OLIVER	She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
L150554	u4726	m313	OLIVER	We'll see that she gets there in good time
L150553	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
L150529	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
L150528	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
L150527	u4726	m313	OLIVER	No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
L150526	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
L150525	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
L151598	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
L151597	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Jennifer gave her a make-over.
L151596	u4727	m314	CARLTON	No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
L151585	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Can we get some service here?
L151584	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Waiter! She needs more water.
L151192	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
L151191	u4730	m314	GEORGE	My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
L151190	u4727	m314	CARLTON	I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
L151189	u4730	m314	GEORGE	I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
L151188	u4727	m314	CARLTON	What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
L151187	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
L151186	u4727	m314	CARLTON	That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
L151185	u4730	m314	GEORGE	It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
L151613	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Never felt better.
L151612	u4727	m314	CARLTON	I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
L151611	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've been working out.
L151610	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Wow your body's really hot.
L151609	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Your lips look delicious.
L151608	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What?
L151606	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah but they looked cool...
L151605	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
L151604	u4727	m314	CARLTON	James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
L151603	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151602	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
L151601	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
L151600	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've changed a lot lately.
L151599	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
L151577	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
L151576	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe ""coyote ugly"" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally ""ugly"" but is really beautiful."
L151575	u4727	m314	CARLTON	"No one I've run into knows what ""coyote ugly"" means."
L151573	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
L151572	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
L151571	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
L151471	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
L151470	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Does she have PMS?
L151469	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	"Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called ""The PMS Diet,"" which may be helpful."
L151468	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I get crazy dreams and I black out.
L151467	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
L151466	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
L151465	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	How have you been feeling?
L151464	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Nearly four.
L151463	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
L151264	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's not just in my head.
L151263	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
L151262	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What else is there?
L151261	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
L151260	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
L151259	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
L151258	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Good. Except for PMS.
L151257	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	How's the rest of your health?
L151255	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, it was another woman.
L151254	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	A dog at Victoria's Secret?
L151253	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh, on my wrist.
L151252	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	I mean where on your body?
L151251	u4729	m314	FRIDA	There was a sale.
L151250	u4729	m314	FRIDA	At Victoria's Secret.
L151249	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
L151643	u4735	m314	MOTHER	It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
L151642	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
L151641	u4735	m314	MOTHER	You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
L151640	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What does that have to do with me?
L151639	u4735	m314	MOTHER	"We're worried about you. ""60 Minutes"" was on same-sex couples."
L151638	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mom!
L151637	u4735	m314	MOTHER	No it's mom.
L151636	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Jennifer?
L152038	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Sure. See ya.
L152037	u4729	m314	FRIDA	God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
L152036	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
L152035	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
L152034	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida? You okay?
L152033	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Hello?
L151977	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
L151976	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
L151975	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wish I only had your problems.
L151974	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
L151973	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I thought you and George were getting married.
L151972	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
L151971	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Did I kill a guy named Benito?
L151970	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	About Benito.
L151969	u4729	m314	FRIDA	About Mark? Carlton?
L151968	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I think George knows.
L151967	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see ""American Werewolf in London?"""
L151966	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No. I won't let you do that.
L151965	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
L151964	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I guess you'll find out.
L151963	u4729	m314	FRIDA	But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
L151962	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
L151961	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
L151960	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
L151959	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
L151958	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
L151957	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm cleaning my stove.
L151939	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I already have.
L151938	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Fall in love.
L151937	u4729	m314	FRIDA	So what do I do?
L151936	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What choice do we have?
L151935	u4729	m314	FRIDA	So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
L151934	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
L151933	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Guess she never found true love.
L151932	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
L151931	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
L151930	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves. See I knew you never loved Mark.
L151929	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
L151928	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. ""The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."""
L151926	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Check out what I found.
L151925	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem... Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
L151895	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
L151894	u4729	m314	FRIDA	The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
L151893	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
L151892	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Peter keeps asking me out.
L151891	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
L151868	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
L151867	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're such a good friend.
L151866	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
L151865	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
L151864	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Does that mean this whole thing is over?
L151863	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I just got my period.
L151856	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
L151855	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Peter knows something.
L151809	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hide him.
L151808	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What the fuck are we going to do?
L151804	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Tell them you'll meet them outside.
L151803	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
L151802	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Ignore it.
L151801	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151800	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You expecting someone?
L151799	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You should have seen it erect.
L151798	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
L151791	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
L151790	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
L151789	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
L151788	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I could smell another woman on him.
L151787	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Why the fuck would you do that?
L151786	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
L151785	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
L151784	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
L151783	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
L151782	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
L151781	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
L151780	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What? Why'd you do that?
L151779	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
L151778	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Why not? There's been a murder.
L151777	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	DON'T call the police.
L151776	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
L151775	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What happened to his tooth?
L151768	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah, I guess. Mark?
L151767	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	He's been here all night?
L151766	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
L151765	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Did you get rid of Mark?
L151764	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Holy shit, I don't know.
L151744	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
L151743	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay, I gotta go.
L151742	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Get rid of him!
L151738	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
L151737	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
L151736	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And he was missing an arm.
L151735	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh no.
L151734	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, Carlton's dead.
L151733	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Shit, I guess I missed work.
L151732	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Tuesday. Are you okay?
L151731	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've been here. What day is it?
L151730	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
L151729	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Hello?
L151670	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
L151669	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
L151668	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I haven't gotten it yet.
L151667	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
L151666	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
L151665	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
L151664	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
L151663	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
L151662	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
L151661	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And what makes you think you killed a man?
L151660	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I put it down the garbage disposal.
L151659	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So where's this infamous arm now?
L151634	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
L151633	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
L151632	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
L151631	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
L151630	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
L151628	u4729	m314	FRIDA	There is a man's arm in my bed.
L151627	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
L151595	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
L151594	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
L151593	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
L151592	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No they're not.
L151591	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
L151590	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No you don't, believe me.
L151589	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
L151588	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
L151587	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
L151581	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I still thought it was a purse.
L151580	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word ""bag."" It used to be ""No, that's not my bag"" -- meaning not my thing. But now ""my bag"" means ""my fault."""
L151579	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It is so hot in here.
L151578	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Charming Carlton.
L151570	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said ""Hey there beautiful."""
L151569	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I think he called you beautiful.
L151568	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What did he say?
L151566	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're just saying that.
L151565	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
L151564	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
L151559	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
L151558	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay. I guess so.
L151557	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
L151555	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
L151554	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
L151553	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
L151552	u4729	m314	FRIDA	We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
L151551	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How'd it go with the cop?
L151550	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I looked like an Italian man!
L151549	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
L151548	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
L151527	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, ""I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?"" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out..."
L151526	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What the hell is the tampon test?
L151525	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Give him the tampon test.
L151524	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
L151523	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
L151522	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
L151436	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
L151435	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
L151434	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
L151433	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
L151432	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
L151420	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
L151419	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wonder if he's married.
L151418	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Rule one: always wear make-up.
L151417	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
L151416	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
L151415	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
L151414	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Are those Mark's?
L151413	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My vision got worse again.
L151412	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
L151411	u4729	m314	FRIDA	And my bra finally fits again.
L151410	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	At least your PMS is over.
L151409	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
L151408	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And then?
L151407	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
L151406	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What? Why the hell did he do that?
L151405	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
L151404	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
L151403	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
L151402	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
L151401	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
L151400	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
L151399	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. I don't think so.
L151398	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No, did you fuck him?
L151397	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Did I kill him? Of course not!
L151396	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So did you do it?
L151395	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
L151394	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Why would they exaggerate?
L151393	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I'm sure they were exaggerating.
L151392	u4729	m314	FRIDA	And he was ripped limb from limb?
L151391	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
L151390	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
L151322	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
L151321	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hey, did you get contacts?
L151320	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
L151319	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Holy shit, I'm a freak.
L151318	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
L151317	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
L151316	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Where?
L151314	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
L151313	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
L151312	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"Are you kidding? He might as well say, ""Can I date rape you?"""
L151311	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Maybe they have to pee.
L151310	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. ""Can I use your phone?"" ""How about a nightcap?"" ""I want to meet your cat."" And my all-time favorite, the old standby, ""I have to use your bathroom."""
L151309	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
L151308	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
L151307	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
L151248	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
L151247	u4729	m314	FRIDA	George bit you?
L151246	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
L151245	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think she broke the skin.
L151244	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
L151243	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And she got the medium.
L151242	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
L151236	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, grab that red one.
L151235	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Where are all the mediums?
L151230	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
L151229	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know.
L151228	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
L151227	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
L151226	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
L151207	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
L151206	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Or if there's a full moon.
L151201	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
L151200	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
L151199	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Can't you get contacts?
L151198	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Only to see.
L151197	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Do you really need these?
L151196	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're just saying that.
L151195	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
L151184	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'd kill for just a little bloated.
L151183	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I get a little bloated sometimes.
L151182	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
L151181	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
L151180	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
L151179	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe he's just shy.
L151178	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He hasn't said one word to me.
L151168	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	People notice you Frida.
L151167	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
L151164	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So don't look in his eyes.
L151163	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
L151162	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
L151161	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He's a very talented musician.
L151160	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
L151159	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My shrink says he's not so bad.
L151158	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Anything's better than Mark.
L151157	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Translation: a total geek.
L151156	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
L151155	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
L151154	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
L151153	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
L151358	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
L151357	u4731	m314	GREGORY	So pee? Here?
L151356	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Uh huh. So pee.
L151355	u4731	m314	GREGORY	I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
L151354	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
L151353	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Yes I do have to pee!
L151352	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You don't have to pee.
L151351	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Knock what off?
L151350	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh come on. Knock it off.
L151349	u4731	m314	GREGORY	That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
L151348	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My apartment's just such a mess.
L151347	u4731	m314	GREGORY	I didn't have to pee then.
L151346	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You should have gone at the restaurant.
L151345	u4731	m314	GREGORY	I really gotta pee.
L151344	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What?
L151342	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
L151341	u4731	m314	GREGORY	They say sex is great for cramps.
L151340	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
L151339	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
L151338	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm really tired.
L151337	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Hey, how about a little nightcap?
L151336	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
L151334	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That's great. Highly original.
L151333	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Well, whattdaya think?
L151332	u4731	m314	GREGORY	"So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, ""Son, you got into Harvard!"" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating."
L151328	u4731	m314	GREGORY	You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
L151327	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm not really hungry after all.
L151326	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
L151324	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Starving.
L151323	u4731	m314	GREGORY	You hungry?
L151276	u4731	m314	GREGORY	No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
L151275	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're kidding, really?
L151274	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
L151273	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I do development for TV movies.
L151272	u4731	m314	GREGORY	So you're Grant's secretary?
L151271	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I know.
L151762	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Take your shower.
L151761	u4734	m314	MARK	Wow.
L151760	u4734	m314	MARK	Yeah?
L151759	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mark.
L151756	u4734	m314	MARK	I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
L151755	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My bra is my biggest supporter.
L151754	u4734	m314	MARK	Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
L151753	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
L151752	u4734	m314	MARK	It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
L151751	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
L151750	u4734	m314	MARK	These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
L151749	u4729	m314	FRIDA	So pay them back and apologize.
L151748	u4734	m314	MARK	I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
L151747	u4734	m314	MARK	Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
L151746	u4729	m314	FRIDA	This really isn't a good time.
L151745	u4734	m314	MARK	It's a matter of life and death.
L151741	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's Mark.
L151740	u4734	m314	MARK	Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
L151480	u4734	m314	MARK	I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
L151479	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Where'd you get the bike?
L151306	u4734	m314	MARK	I'm working on it...
L151305	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
L151304	u4734	m314	MARK	Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
L151303	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah right... You better go.
L151302	u4734	m314	MARK	Frida, you know you're it for me.
L151301	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
L151300	u4734	m314	MARK	OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
L151298	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't help it, it smells so good.
L151297	u4734	m314	MARK	Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
L151296	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, I'm sorry!
L151295	u4734	m314	MARK	Look what you did!
L151293	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151292	u4734	m314	MARK	You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
L151291	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You never say that.
L151290	u4734	m314	MARK	You look different. I mean you look good.
L151288	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Since when do you care?
L151287	u4734	m314	MARK	What, you got a date or somethin'?
L151874	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Very well then. Is that all?
L151873	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
L151872	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	No?
L151871	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151870	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
L151869	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
L151462	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
L151461	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think we should do something with strong female characters...
L151460	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Yes, that's what we're looking for.
L151459	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
L151440	u4729	m314	FRIDA	A little.
L151439	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Did you change your hair?
L151438	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?"
L151219	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Your desk.
L151218	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Coffee and...
L151217	u4729	m314	FRIDA	On your desk.
L151216	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Script coverage?
L151215	u4729	m314	FRIDA	On your desk.
L151214	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	The Nielson's?
L152042	u4737	m314	PETER	Thanks.
L152041	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Here's a towel.
L152030	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay.
L152029	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm going to take a shower.
L152026	u4737	m314	PETER	I know. The important thing is that it stop.
L152025	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
L152024	u4737	m314	PETER	No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
L152023	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What about... those guys... I might have...
L152022	u4737	m314	PETER	Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
L152021	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Worse than this?
L152020	u4737	m314	PETER	We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
L152019	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
L152018	u4737	m314	PETER	I knew you wouldn't kill me.
L152015	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
L152014	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
L152013	u4737	m314	PETER	Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
L152012	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Be careful!
L152010	u4737	m314	PETER	I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
L152009	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
L152008	u4737	m314	PETER	I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
L152007	u4729	m314	FRIDA	How do you know?
L152006	u4737	m314	PETER	I don't think you'll hurt me.
L152005	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Peter I love you too but...
L152004	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
L152003	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Go away. I might hurt you.
L151992	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
L151991	u4737	m314	PETER	If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
L151990	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
L151989	u4737	m314	PETER	Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
L151988	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
L151987	u4737	m314	PETER	You at least owe me the truth.
L151986	u4737	m314	PETER	Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
L151985	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
L151984	u4737	m314	PETER	What? Is there someone else?
L151983	u4729	m314	FRIDA	NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
L151982	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
L151981	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Hello?
L151944	u4737	m314	PETER	No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
L151943	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
L151942	u4737	m314	PETER	No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
L151941	u4729	m314	FRIDA	They do? Oh no...
L151940	u4737	m314	PETER	Your breasts feel larger.
L151913	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
L151912	u4737	m314	PETER	You know, I've never seen your cat.
L151911	u4729	m314	FRIDA	They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
L151910	u4737	m314	PETER	What's with the squirt guns?
L151909	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I love you too.
L151908	u4737	m314	PETER	You didn't say it.
L151907	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
L151906	u4737	m314	PETER	Is that how you feel?
L151905	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say ""I love you too"" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it."
L151904	u4737	m314	PETER	Is it that funny?
L151902	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, my bite's a lot worse.
L151901	u4737	m314	PETER	You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
L151900	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"This is a lot worse than ""Betty."""
L151899	u4737	m314	PETER	"That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, ""You're talking to Betty now"" and we'd leave the house for a few days."
L151889	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Interesting possibility.
L151888	u4737	m314	PETER	Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
L151887	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, but thanks for the warning.
L151886	u4737	m314	PETER	Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
L151885	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What's that supposed to mean?
L151884	u4737	m314	PETER	Except Mark of course.
L151883	u4737	m314	PETER	Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
L151882	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
L151881	u4737	m314	PETER	I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
L151880	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What happened?
L151879	u4737	m314	PETER	What happened?
L151878	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I got it. It's okay.
L151877	u4737	m314	PETER	I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
L151876	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
L151875	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
L151851	u4737	m314	PETER	He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
L151850	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, why?
L151848	u4737	m314	PETER	Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
L151847	u4729	m314	FRIDA	But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
L151845	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
L151844	u4737	m314	PETER	No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
L151824	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
L151823	u4737	m314	PETER	You had a date with Carlton?
L151807	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
L151806	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
L151805	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Uh.... hi!
L151658	u4737	m314	PETER	A man killed in Central Park.
L151657	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Everything okay?
L151653	u4729	m314	FRIDA	NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
L151652	u4737	m314	PETER	You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
L151651	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. Nope, nothing in it.
L151650	u4737	m314	PETER	Was there anything in that washer?
L151648	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
L151647	u4737	m314	PETER	No. I was doing my laundry.
L151646	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
L151546	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
L151545	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
L151544	u4737	m314	PETER	I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
L151541	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My period? No.
L151540	u4737	m314	PETER	Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
L151539	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What's wrong?
L151538	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay, you busted me.
L151537	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
L151534	u4737	m314	PETER	Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
L151533	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What are they for?
L151532	u4737	m314	PETER	Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
L151531	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What are those?
L151521	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Goodnight.
L151520	u4737	m314	PETER	Goodnight.
L151519	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah. Maybe.
L151518	u4737	m314	PETER	Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
L151517	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I really gotta get going.
L151516	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
L151515	u4737	m314	PETER	Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
L151514	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
L151513	u4737	m314	PETER	Briefs.
L151512	u4729	m314	FRIDA	How about you? Briefs or boxers?
L151510	u4737	m314	PETER	Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
L151509	u4729	m314	FRIDA	A lot of people don't wear underwear.
L151508	u4737	m314	PETER	You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
L151507	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Like what?
L151506	u4737	m314	PETER	Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
L151505	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
L151504	u4737	m314	PETER	The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
L151503	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
L151502	u4737	m314	PETER	We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
L151501	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, by wolves?
L151500	u4737	m314	PETER	I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
L151499	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm sorry.
L151498	u4737	m314	PETER	No, she died when I was twelve.
L151497	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Used to? Did it stop finally?
L151496	u4737	m314	PETER	My mom used to get PMS too.
L151495	u4737	m314	PETER	I can forgive you a bestseller.
L151494	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's stupid.
L151493	u4737	m314	PETER	No really, I love knowing what people read.
L151492	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh, it's nothing.
L151491	u4737	m314	PETER	So what book did you buy?
L151490	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
L151489	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
L151488	u4737	m314	PETER	Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
L151487	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
L151486	u4737	m314	PETER	You wanna get some coffee?
L151485	u4737	m314	PETER	There's a lot of that going around.
L151484	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
L151483	u4737	m314	PETER	Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
L151477	u4737	m314	PETER	At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
L151476	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
L151475	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Intriguing?
L151474	u4737	m314	PETER	No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
L151473	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Are you following me?
L151472	u4737	m314	PETER	You busted me.
L151383	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
L151382	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
L151377	u4729	m314	FRIDA	We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
L151376	u4737	m314	PETER	When's the last time you saw him?
L151680	u4738	m314	SHRINK	"You use the word ""fucking."" You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex."
L151679	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
L151678	u4738	m314	SHRINK	"You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose ""eating him"" as the method of killing?"
L151677	u4729	m314	FRIDA	We didn't have sex.
L151676	u4738	m314	SHRINK	Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
L151675	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
L151674	u4738	m314	SHRINK	And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
L151673	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I ate a guy last night.
L151672	u4738	m314	SHRINK	Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
L151671	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I'm a werewolf.
L151225	u4738	m314	SHRINK	Oh, I see... interesting theory.
L151224	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
L151840	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Packages of money.
L151839	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
L151832	u4733	m314	LLOYD	How big?
L151831	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I have a cat.
L151830	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You got a dog?
L151829	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
L151826	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What makes you think I was the last one?
L151825	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
L151822	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
L151821	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You heard about Carlton Fraser?
L151388	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, take it.
L151387	u4733	m314	LLOYD	We can get a warrant if you like.
L151379	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I said it was our first date.
L151378	u4733	m314	LLOYD	A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
L151375	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
L151374	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, it was our first date.
L151373	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
L151372	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes... I... we had dinner.
L151366	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, what happened?
L151365	u4733	m314	LLOYD	It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
L151688	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
L151687	u4730	m314	GEORGE	You can't believe this bullshit.
L151686	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Take some allergy medicine.
L151685	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
L151684	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
L151683	u4730	m314	GEORGE	You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
L151682	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
L151681	u4730	m314	GEORGE	I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
L151626	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Tell her I'm eating.
L151625	u4730	m314	GEORGE	It's for you. Frida.
L151617	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
L151616	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
L151615	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
L151563	u4730	m314	GEORGE	She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
L151562	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
L151561	u4730	m314	GEORGE	She's just so... pathetic.
L151560	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
L151205	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
L151204	u4730	m314	GEORGE	He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
L151171	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
L151170	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"So I asked the bartender what ""coyote ugly"" meant. It's like the ""bagger"" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger..."
L151838	u4737	m314	PETER	He's been running money for the Mafia.
L151837	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	See he was cheating from the get go.
L151817	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
L151816	u4737	m314	PETER	Why would you want to be a cop?
L151815	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
L151386	u4737	m314	PETER	We can just take this pillowcase.
L151385	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You want her sheets?
L151381	u4737	m314	PETER	We're just trying to figure out what happened.
L151380	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How the hell is that your business?
L151371	u4737	m314	PETER	Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
L151370	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
L152002	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
L152001	u4737	m314	PETER	What kind of animal?
L152000	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
L151999	u4737	m314	PETER	Did we get those DNA tests back?
L151998	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And that was 28 days ago today.
L151997	u4737	m314	PETER	So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
L151996	u4733	m314	LLOYD	She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
L151995	u4737	m314	PETER	What makes her think that?
L151994	u4733	m314	LLOYD	My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
L151924	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
L151923	u4737	m314	PETER	What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
L151922	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
L151921	u4737	m314	PETER	What are you talking about?
L151920	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And fifth, you're dating her.
L151919	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
L151918	u4733	m314	LLOYD	It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
L151917	u4737	m314	PETER	Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
L151916	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You think mafia hit?
L151860	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Like a vampire or some shit?
L151859	u4737	m314	PETER	It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
L151858	u4733	m314	LLOYD	It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
L151857	u4737	m314	PETER	Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
L151842	u4733	m314	LLOYD	One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
L151841	u4737	m314	PETER	Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
L151828	u4733	m314	LLOYD	This one walk you home too?
L151827	u4737	m314	PETER	He means the last that we know of.
L151797	u4737	m314	PETER	She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
L151796	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
L151795	u4737	m314	PETER	Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
L151794	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
L151793	u4737	m314	PETER	The park dude was missing an arm.
L151792	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
L151726	u4737	m314	PETER	You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
L151725	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
L151724	u4737	m314	PETER	She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
L151723	u4733	m314	LLOYD	She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
L151722	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
L151721	u4733	m314	LLOYD	This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
L151720	u4737	m314	PETER	We only live a few blocks apart.
L151719	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
L151697	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And he was missing an arm.
L151696	u4737	m314	PETER	He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
L151455	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And you think I'm sick?
L151454	u4737	m314	PETER	What?
L151453	u4737	m314	PETER	Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
L151452	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
L151451	u4737	m314	PETER	Madonna's in Penthouse?
L151450	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
L151449	u4737	m314	PETER	Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
L151448	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
L151447	u4737	m314	PETER	She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
L151446	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Hey, there was a lot of blood.
L151445	u4737	m314	PETER	I told you she was innocent.
L151444	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
L151427	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
L151426	u4737	m314	PETER	I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
L151425	u4733	m314	LLOYD	No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
L151424	u4737	m314	PETER	Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
L151423	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
L151422	u4737	m314	PETER	That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
L151421	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
L151368	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
L151367	u4737	m314	PETER	He was found a few blocks away.
L151281	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
L151280	u4737	m314	PETER	You're some catch Lloyd.
L151279	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
L151278	u4737	m314	PETER	Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
L151277	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
L156800	u4760	m317	CHICO	Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
L156799	u4769	m317	RHODES	How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
L156798	u4760	m317	CHICO	To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
L156797	u4769	m317	RHODES	Then why did you come here?
L156796	u4760	m317	CHICO	There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
L156795	u4769	m317	RHODES	Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
L156794	u4760	m317	CHICO	The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
L156793	u4769	m317	RHODES	I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
L156792	u4760	m317	CHICO	Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
L156791	u4769	m317	RHODES	I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
L156790	u4760	m317	CHICO	NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
L156789	u4769	m317	RHODES	After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
L156788	u4769	m317	RHODES	And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
L156787	u4760	m317	CHICO	Please....shoot me.
L156783	u4769	m317	RHODES	Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
L156782	u4760	m317	CHICO	Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
L156765	u4770	m317	SARAH	Come on.
L156764	u4760	m317	CHICO	It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
L156762	u4770	m317	SARAH	Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
L156761	u4760	m317	CHICO	What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
L156760	u4770	m317	SARAH	Look.
L156759	u4760	m317	CHICO	It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
L156758	u4760	m317	CHICO	I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
L156757	u4770	m317	SARAH	What is it?
L156751	u4770	m317	SARAH	No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
L156750	u4760	m317	CHICO	His madness....could be from shock.
L156723	u4760	m317	CHICO	Leave him.
L156722	u4770	m317	SARAH	Help me get him to the boat.
L157112	u4765	m317	LOGAN	Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
L157111	u4761	m317	DIESEL	You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
L157079	u4765	m317	LOGAN	Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
L157078	u4761	m317	DIESEL	Quiet!
L157077	u4765	m317	LOGAN	I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
L156935	u4765	m317	LOGAN	I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
L156934	u4761	m317	DIESEL	Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
L156923	u4761	m317	DIESEL	The tunnel.
L156922	u4765	m317	LOGAN	What is it?
L157001	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
L157000	u4767	m317	MARY	It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
L156999	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
L156998	u4767	m317	MARY	We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
L156997	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
L156990	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
L156989	u4767	m317	MARY	Tonight?
L156988	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
L156987	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
L156986	u4767	m317	MARY	I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
L156985	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
L156984	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
L156983	u4767	m317	MARY	THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
L156982	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
L156981	u4767	m317	MARY	Sir. It's quite clear that...
L156977	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
L156976	u4767	m317	MARY	...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
L156975	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Miss Henried, I think you better...
L156972	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
L156971	u4767	m317	MARY	I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
L156970	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
L157179	u4763	m317	JOHN	Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
L157178	u4770	m317	SARAH	How long do we have to watch him?
L157159	u4770	m317	SARAH	It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
L157158	u4763	m317	JOHN	What is it?
L157063	u4763	m317	JOHN	We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
L157062	u4770	m317	SARAH	Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
L157057	u4770	m317	SARAH	There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
L157056	u4763	m317	JOHN	We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
L157055	u4770	m317	SARAH	Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
L157054	u4763	m317	JOHN	Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
L157053	u4770	m317	SARAH	What?
L157052	u4763	m317	JOHN	Datura.
L157051	u4770	m317	SARAH	Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
L157006	u4763	m317	JOHN	He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
L157005	u4770	m317	SARAH	Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
L156941	u4763	m317	JOHN	You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
L156940	u4770	m317	SARAH	They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
L156845	u4770	m317	SARAH	No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
L156844	u4763	m317	JOHN	Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
L156843	u4770	m317	SARAH	I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
L156841	u4763	m317	JOHN	You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
L156840	u4770	m317	SARAH	Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
L156839	u4763	m317	JOHN	That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
L156838	u4770	m317	SARAH	Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
L156837	u4763	m317	JOHN	I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
L156836	u4770	m317	SARAH	We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
L156835	u4763	m317	JOHN	That sounds like a curse to me.
L156834	u4770	m317	SARAH	It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
L156833	u4763	m317	JOHN	What is it if it ain't a curse?
L156832	u4770	m317	SARAH	Curse?
L156831	u4763	m317	JOHN	How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
L156830	u4770	m317	SARAH	The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
L156828	u4763	m317	JOHN	I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
L156827	u4770	m317	SARAH	Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
L156825	u4763	m317	JOHN	Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
L156824	u4770	m317	SARAH	We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
L156823	u4763	m317	JOHN	That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
L156822	u4770	m317	SARAH	Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
L156821	u4763	m317	JOHN	He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
L156820	u4770	m317	SARAH	Gasparilla?
L156819	u4763	m317	JOHN	Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
L157106	u4771	m317	TOBY	Come on!
L157105	u4763	m317	JOHN	What you wanna do?
L157104	u4771	m317	TOBY	That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
L157065	u4763	m317	JOHN	Come on. Let's go.
L157064	u4771	m317	TOBY	That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
L157061	u4763	m317	JOHN	I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
L157060	u4771	m317	TOBY	If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
L157059	u4763	m317	JOHN	Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
L157058	u4771	m317	TOBY	This stuff really works? No shit?
L157044	u4771	m317	TOBY	A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
L157043	u4763	m317	JOHN	We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
L157042	u4771	m317	TOBY	What?
L157041	u4763	m317	JOHN	We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
L157040	u4771	m317	TOBY	Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
L157039	u4763	m317	JOHN	We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
L157038	u4771	m317	TOBY	It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
L157029	u4771	m317	TOBY	I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
L157028	u4763	m317	JOHN	I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
L157027	u4771	m317	TOBY	What?
L157026	u4763	m317	JOHN	We got a boat.
L157025	u4771	m317	TOBY	There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
L157024	u4771	m317	TOBY	He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
L157023	u4763	m317	JOHN	What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
L157013	u4763	m317	JOHN	Maybe.
L157012	u4771	m317	TOBY	Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
L157011	u4763	m317	JOHN	The hospital? 
L157010	u4771	m317	TOBY	I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
L157009	u4771	m317	TOBY	Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
L157008	u4763	m317	JOHN	Ain't no place safe.
L157007	u4771	m317	TOBY	It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
L156866	u4769	m317	RHODES	The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
L156865	u4764	m317	JULIE	I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
L156864	u4769	m317	RHODES	They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
L156863	u4764	m317	JULIE	But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
L156862	u4769	m317	RHODES	Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
L156861	u4764	m317	JULIE	I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
L156743	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
L156742	u4766	m317	MARIA	You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
L156741	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
L156740	u4766	m317	MARIA	We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
L156739	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
L156733	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
L156732	u4766	m317	MARIA	You are dying, too.
L156731	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	He is dying. He knows it.
L156730	u4772	m317	TONY	...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
L156729	u4766	m317	MARIA	NOOOOOOOOO!
L156727	u4772	m317	TONY	I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
L156726	u4766	m317	MARIA	Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
L156725	u4772	m317	TONY	Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
L156721	u4772	m317	TONY	PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
L156720	u4766	m317	MARIA	TONY....TONY....
L156706	u4772	m317	TONY	I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
L156705	u4766	m317	MARIA	Dios mia.
L156974	u4767	m317	MARY	Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
L156973	u4769	m317	RHODES	Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
L156887	u4769	m317	RHODES	No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
L156886	u4767	m317	MARY	You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
L156885	u4769	m317	RHODES	I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
L156881	u4767	m317	MARY	Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
L156880	u4769	m317	RHODES	Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
L156879	u4767	m317	MARY	If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
L156878	u4769	m317	RHODES	Oh, I have no doubt.
L156877	u4767	m317	MARY	Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
L156876	u4769	m317	RHODES	And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
L156875	u4767	m317	MARY	You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
L156874	u4767	m317	MARY	Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
L156873	u4769	m317	RHODES	You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
L156868	u4769	m317	RHODES	They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
L156867	u4767	m317	MARY	You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
L156859	u4769	m317	RHODES	No wonder they're so....hungry.
L156858	u4767	m317	MARY	You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
L156857	u4769	m317	RHODES	God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
L156856	u4767	m317	MARY	God....damn you, Rhodes!
L156855	u4769	m317	RHODES	Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
L156911	u4771	m317	TOBY	MARY!
L156910	u4767	m317	MARY	I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
L156909	u4771	m317	TOBY	Mary.
L156900	u4771	m317	TOBY	For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
L156899	u4767	m317	MARY	I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
L156898	u4771	m317	TOBY	Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
L156897	u4767	m317	MARY	I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
L156896	u4771	m317	TOBY	We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
L156895	u4767	m317	MARY	I want you to leave. Then maybe...
L156894	u4771	m317	TOBY	Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
L156893	u4767	m317	MARY	It's because of me.
L156892	u4771	m317	TOBY	That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
L156891	u4767	m317	MARY	Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
L156890	u4771	m317	TOBY	Hey. Slow down. What is it?
L156889	u4767	m317	MARY	Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
L156814	u4771	m317	TOBY	In the battle, sir.
L156813	u4769	m317	RHODES	It's been fired.
L156812	u4769	m317	RHODES	Let me see your weapon.
L156811	u4771	m317	TOBY	No, sir.
L156810	u4769	m317	RHODES	You fired that shot, didn't you?
L156809	u4771	m317	TOBY	Sir!
L156808	u4769	m317	RHODES	Step up here, Tyler.
L156805	u4769	m317	RHODES	I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
L156804	u4771	m317	TOBY	Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
L156803	u4769	m317	RHODES	No time for that. I'll take care of them.
L156802	u4771	m317	TOBY	"My...""detail"", sir. We're going to bury the heads."
L156801	u4769	m317	RHODES	Where are you going, Tyler?
L157146	u4773	m317	TRICKS	I'm alright. Let's go.
L157145	u4771	m317	TOBY	Tricks...Jesus...
L157018	u4771	m317	TOBY	We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
L157017	u4773	m317	TRICKS	Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
L157016	u4771	m317	TOBY	What'dya get?
L157015	u4773	m317	TRICKS	Not as bad as yours, pal.
L157014	u4771	m317	TOBY	Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
L159997	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
L159996	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	They are...they are everywhere.
L159993	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	We're going to die here! We're going to die!
L159992	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It's not going to help us!
L159977	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Why don't you want a message sent?
L159976	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	He's the owner...
L159975	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Who are you?
L159960	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	We have to make it to the third deck...
L159959	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	How do we get out of here?
L159958	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	Yes.
L159957	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You the Captain?
L160110	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
L160109	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	And what? These things are octopusses?
L160108	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
L160107	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	What the hell are you talking about?
L160106	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
L160105	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
L160104	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
L160101	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Boat or no boat...I'm going...
L160100	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
L160097	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
L160096	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Who?
L160124	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
L160123	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Maybe we lost them.
L160059	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Just trying to get to my boat...
L160058	u4791	m319	HANOVER	You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
L160057	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	That's where my boat's moored.
L160056	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Who gives a shit about aft?
L159943	u4791	m319	HANOVER	With who?
L159942	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Did you clear this?
L159941	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
L159938	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I told you...
L159937	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
L159936	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Shut up!
L159935	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Hanover, listen...
L159928	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Dead.
L159927	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Where are my men?
L159793	u4791	m319	HANOVER	I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
L159792	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
L159791	u4791	m319	HANOVER	And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
L159790	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
L159775	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Then you better start swimming.
L159774	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Not an option.
L159773	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You're going to have to get a new one.
L159772	u4791	m319	HANOVER	We were talking about my schedule...
L159769	u4791	m319	HANOVER	I have a schedule...
L159768	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
L159767	u4791	m319	HANOVER	How soon can we get up and running?
L159766	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
L159723	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
L159722	u4791	m319	HANOVER	He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
L159721	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Who asked any?
L159720	u4791	m319	HANOVER	And no questions asked.
L159719	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
L159718	u4791	m319	HANOVER	This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
L159670	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
L159669	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
L159665	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
L159664	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
L159663	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Which question is that?
L159662	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
L159661	u4791	m319	HANOVER	And where is our point of arrival?
L159660	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Right here...middle of nowhere...
L159658	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
L159657	u4791	m319	HANOVER	No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
L159656	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
L159655	u4791	m319	HANOVER	You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
L160248	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	He's not coming...
L160247	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Where's you friend?
L160244	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	This time, make an exception.
L160243	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I don't take orders at all.
L160242	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You don't take orders very well, do you?
L160241	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	No...
L160240	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
L160239	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Soon as I get over the heart attack...
L160238	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
L160201	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	And what if I run into one of those things?
L160200	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
L160199	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You want ME to go up there?
L160196	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Right...
L160195	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
L160186	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Jet ski...there's one left up there.
L160185	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
L160184	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
L160181	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
L160180	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Yeah...
L160179	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Finnegan...
L160172	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Not like him.
L160171	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
L160160	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
L160159	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What?
L160158	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It's not them...it's it...
L160151	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Keep tasting...
L160150	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
L160143	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
L160142	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
L160138	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You should talk...
L160137	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Looking good...
L160127	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	We can't just leave them here.
L160126	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	A meat locker.
L160125	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What is it?
L160122	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	The quiet...
L160121	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What's the matter?
L160119	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I'm saying they're calling the shots...
L160118	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You're saying they can think?
L160117	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Like cattle...
L160041	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Takes one to know one.
L160040	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	How do you know that?
L160039	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	"The ""come back"" kind."
L160038	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Oh yeah? What kind is that?
L160037	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
L160036	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Right... You have a boat.
L160035	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Yeah you did...
L160034	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Hey! I didn't have to come back.
L160033	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Got it?
L160030	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	On the side!!
L160029	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I don't know where it is!
L160026	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Takes one to know one.
L160025	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
L160024	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Self sufficient...
L160023	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Anti social?
L160022	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
L160021	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Quite a few.
L160020	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Seen a lot of islands?
L160019	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	That's what I do.
L160018	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
L160013	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Thank you, I work at it...
L160012	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Well, you sure do a good imitation.
L160011	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I'm not rich people.
L160010	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You people...rich people...
L160009	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What's that supposed to mean? You people.
L160008	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
L160007	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You don't have to be so touchy.
L160006	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
L160005	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
L160004	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
L160003	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
L160002	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't know...
L160001	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What are those things?
L160000	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Jesus Christ lady...
L159999	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Noooo!
L159995	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You hear that?
L159994	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
L159988	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	He's with them.
L159987	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What are you people talking about?
L159986	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Unless you collected on the insurance...
L159922	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I'm their ride.
L159921	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Then who are you?
L159920	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I'm not a thief.
L159919	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	The thieves.
L159918	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	What other bunch?
L159915	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Who asked you to!
L159914	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I saved your life is what I did!
L159913	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Now look what you did!
L159910	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It ain't any better out there!
L159909	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I'm not staying here!
L159891	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
L159890	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
L159889	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Shut up! You hear me!!
L159888	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Forget them...
L159887	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Hanover!! Hanover!!
L159845	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
L159844	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
L159843	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	So?
L159842	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
L159808	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	You ain't giving the orders here!
L159807	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Let's just keep going.
L160260	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
L160259	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...
L160258	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
L160257	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...
L160256	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
L160221	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
L160220	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
L160219	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
L160218	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	She's gone...
L160217	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	One whistle... Start the engine...
L160216	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Man, don't go up there...
L160214	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	How does an island sound to you?
L160213	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	And what have you come up with?
L160212	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I have been.
L160211	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
L160210	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Line it up now, nice and easy...
L160209	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
L160208	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	A little to the left...
L160207	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
L160205	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
L160204	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
L160198	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
L160197	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
L160194	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
L160193	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
L160192	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
L160191	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
L160190	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
L160189	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
L160188	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
L160055	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	That way.
L160054	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey... Which way's aft?
L159903	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
L159902	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't know...you got what we need?
L159901	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Finnegan, what the hell was that?
L159835	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I'm stuck...
L159834	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It's okay...come on...
L159828	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...look at me...
L159827	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
L159826	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...it's okay...
L159825	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
L159824	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...
L159823	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
L159779	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
L159778	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I think he knows that Joey.
L159763	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
L159762	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Me??
L159761	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	What did you do the my kids!!
L159740	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
L159739	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
L159738	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
L159737	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	You don't give a shit about anything do you?
L159736	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	...Jagger was here...I was here...

L159652	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
L159646	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I'm flying blind here God damn it!
L159645	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Can we use our indoor voice please...
L160081	u4791	m319	HANOVER	You want some too?
L160080	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Why don't you back off?
L159934	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Nowhere...

L159851	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Someone's back there.
L159850	u4796	m319	VIVO	Nothing.
L159849	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	What was that?
L159804	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Plans don't change...
L159803	u4796	m319	VIVO	Maybe plans changed...
L159802	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
L159706	u4796	m319	VIVO	Like Mamooli's country...
L159705	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	What the hell does that mean?

L197639	u5136	m341	BURKE	Fuck it.
L197638	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What honey?
L197406	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Hiding?
L197405	u5136	m341	BURKE	Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
L197404	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well why are they tearing the building down?
L197403	u5136	m341	BURKE	Well what's wrong?
L197402	u5138	m341	CHRIS	C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
L197401	u5136	m341	BURKE	Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
L197400	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
L198082	u5149	m341	PRESIDENT	Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
L198081	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	I didn't know that.
L198080	u5149	m341	PRESIDENT	It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
L198079	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
L198078	u5149	m341	PRESIDENT	No, he's working on another book.
L198077	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	What's he doing there? Teaching?
L198076	u5149	m341	PRESIDENT	That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
L198075	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
L198074	u5149	m341	PRESIDENT	How about Lankaster Merrin.
L198073	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
L198072	u5149	m341	PRESIDENT	Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
L198071	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Thank you your excellency.
L198070	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
L198069	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I see, your excellency.
L198068	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
L198067	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Yes.
L198066	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
L198065	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
L198064	u5137	m341	CARDINAL	You're convinced that it's genuine.
L197857	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
L197856	u5139	m341	CLINIC DIRECTOR	It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
L197849	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
L197848	u5139	m341	CLINIC DIRECTOR	I'm sorry.
L197847	u5138	m341	CHRIS	And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
L197846	u5139	m341	CLINIC DIRECTOR	It's-
L197845	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
L197844	u5139	m341	CLINIC DIRECTOR	Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
L198198	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Sure you won't change your mind?
L198197	u5153	m341	SHARON	Me too.
L198196	u5138	m341	CHRIS	I'm gonna miss you.
L198195	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Storage.
L198194	u5153	m341	SHARON	Phonograph.
L198193	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What is it?
L198192	u5153	m341	SHARON	Where do you want this?
L197863	u5153	m341	SHARON	Of course I didn't.
L197862	u5138	m341	CHRIS	This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
L197765	u5153	m341	SHARON	I can't believe it.
L197764	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
L197755	u5138	m341	CHRIS	We have to start looking for a shrink.
L197754	u5153	m341	SHARON	What did the doctor say?
L197753	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yeah, well I guess you should've.
L197752	u5153	m341	SHARON	Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
L197751	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What's Burke got to do with it?
L197750	u5153	m341	SHARON	Burke.
L197749	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Didn't who tell me?
L197748	u5153	m341	SHARON	What didn't he tell you?
L197747	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
L197554	u5153	m341	SHARON	Why don't you let me?
L197553	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
L197552	u5153	m341	SHARON	Maybe the circuit is busy?
L197551	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
L197433	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No kidding.
L197432	u5153	m341	SHARON	Just five or six people.
L197431	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
L197430	u5153	m341	SHARON	Dinner at the White House.
L197429	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What's this?
L197428	u5153	m341	SHARON	And you got an invitation.
L197427	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh great, anything else?
L197426	u5153	m341	SHARON	Here.
L197424	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
L197423	u5153	m341	SHARON	Hi, how'd your day go?
L197422	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Hi
L197421	u5153	m341	SHARON	In here!
L197420	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Hello?
L197905	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You're a nice man.
L197904	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Thank you.
L197902	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Really? wow.
L197901	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
L197900	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What's her name?
L197899	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Oh, she'd love it.
L197898	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Of course. Have you got a pen?
L197897	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
L197896	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
L197895	u5138	m341	CHRIS	When she's well enough, I'll ask.
L197894	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	"I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked ""What's this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?"
L197893	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
L197892	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
L197889	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Please.
L197888	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Would you like some more coffee?
L197887	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Never mind.
L197886	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Want to ask him?
L197885	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Oh, I see.
L197884	u5138	m341	CHRIS	I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
L197883	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Groceries maybe? A package?
L197882	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Not that I know of.
L197881	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	You were expecting a deliver y that day?
L197880	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No. Not at all,
L197879	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
L197875	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
L197874	u5138	m341	CHRIS	We still don't know.
L197873	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	May I ask...?
L197872	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yes, I'm affraid it is.
L197871	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	It's serious?
L197870	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No, she was heavily sedated.
L197869	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
L197877	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No thanks Karl.
L197876	u5143	m341	KARL	Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
L197868	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What man?
L197867	u5143	m341	KARL	A man to see you.
L197866	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What!
L197865	u5143	m341	KARL	Excuse me Miss?
L197861	u5143	m341	KARL	No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
L197860	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
L197859	u5143	m341	KARL	She is going to be well?
L197858	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
L197633	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Karl!!
L197632	u5143	m341	KARL	Bastard! I will kill you.
L197563	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
L197562	u5143	m341	KARL	Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
L197561	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
L197560	u5143	m341	KARL	There is nothing.
L197394	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
L197393	u5143	m341	KARL	Yes, I go now.
L197392	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
L197390	u5138	m341	CHRIS	I just heard them Karl.
L197389	u5143	m341	KARL	No. No rats.
L197388	u5138	m341	CHRIS	All right then we've got clean rats.
L197387	u5143	m341	KARL	But it's clean?
L197386	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
L197385	u5143	m341	KARL	Rats?
L197384	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
L197383	u5143	m341	KARL	Good morning Madame.
L197655	u5155	m341	WILLIE	Yes, I think so.
L197654	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Is it coming out Willie?
L197381	u5138	m341	CHRIS	That's good.
L197380	u5155	m341	WILLIE	Fine thank you.
L197379	u5138	m341	CHRIS	How are you today?
L197378	u5155	m341	WILLIE	Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
L197377	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Morning.
L197741	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
L197740	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
L197739	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
L197738	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
L197737	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Are you sure?
L197736	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No. Of course not, nothing like that.
L197735	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Do you keep any drugs in your house?
L197728	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
L197727	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	We still think the temporal lobe...
L197724	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
L197723	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
L197687	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
L197686	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
L197685	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
L197684	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
L197683	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
L197682	u5138	m341	CHRIS	So, what causes this?
L197681	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
L197680	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
L197679	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
L197678	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Convulsion?
L197677	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
L197613	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
L197612	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
L197611	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
L197610	u5138	m341	CHRIS	She used those words?
L197609	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
L197608	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
L197607	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
L197606	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
L197605	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You're kidding! Like what?
L197604	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
L197603	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
L197602	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
L197601	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Never.
L197600	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
L197599	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
L197598	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Lies?
L197597	u5138	m341	CHRIS	And those lies she's been telling?
L197596	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
L197595	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
L197594	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
L197593	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Depression?
L197592	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
L197591	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
L197590	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	A stimulant.
L197589	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What is it? A tranquilizer?
L197588	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
L197587	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	It affects concentration.
L197586	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Why the math?
L197585	u5140	m341	DR. KLEIN	A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
L198184	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No.
L198183	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Is she gonna die?
L198089	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Father?
L198088	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yes. He's already here.
L198051	u5138	m341	CHRIS	She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
L198050	u5144	m341	KARRAS	What?
L198049	u5138	m341	CHRIS	She...killed Burke Dennings.
L198048	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
L198047	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What's the difference?
L198046	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
L198045	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Well I think you should.
L198044	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No
L198043	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Have you told him what's happening?
L198042	u5138	m341	CHRIS	In Europe.
L198041	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Where's Regan's father?
L198040	u5144	m341	KARRAS	It's fine really, sit.
L198039	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Are you sure?
L198038	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No it's alright I'll take it straight.
L198035	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What do you drink?
L198034	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Please.
L198033	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Wanna drink.
L198001	u5144	m341	KARRAS	It's not important good night.
L198000	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Not at all. Why d'you ask?
L197999	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No, is Regan aware of it?
L197998	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yes I did, I'm sorry.
L197997	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Did you know my mother died recently?
L197996	u5138	m341	CHRIS	No.
L197995	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
L197994	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
L197993	u5144	m341	KARRAS	There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
L197992	u5138	m341	CHRIS	I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
L197991	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
L197990	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What else?
L197989	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
L197988	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Like what?
L197987	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
L197986	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
L197985	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
L197968	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
L197967	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
L197966	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
L197965	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
L197964	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Could you see her?
L197963	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
L197962	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You could do it yourself...
L197961	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
L197960	u5138	m341	CHRIS	But how?
L197959	u5144	m341	KARRAS	To begin with it could make things worse.
L197958	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Why, I don't understand?
L197957	u5144	m341	KARRAS	That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
L197955	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
L197954	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
L197953	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh yeah, since when?
L197952	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
L197951	u5138	m341	CHRIS	I didn't get you?
L197950	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
L197949	u5138	m341	CHRIS	If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
L197948	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I beg your pardon?
L197947	u5138	m341	CHRIS	And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
L197946	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
L197945	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You wouldn't.
L197944	u5144	m341	KARRAS	If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
L197943	u5138	m341	CHRIS	I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
L197942	u5144	m341	KARRAS	The priest.
L197941	u5138	m341	CHRIS	On what?
L197940	u5144	m341	KARRAS	That depends.
L197939	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
L197938	u5144	m341	KARRAS	He didn't mention her.
L197937	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Didn't tell you of what she did?
L197936	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No.
L197935	u5138	m341	CHRIS	He didn't mention?
L197934	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No I didn't know you had one.
L197933	u5138	m341	CHRIS	About my daughter?
L197932	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Sure did.
L197931	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Did he tell you about my party?
L197930	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Pretty close.
L197929	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Pretty close?
L197928	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Yes am.
L197927	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
L197926	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
L197925	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Where?
L197924	u5144	m341	KARRAS	It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
L197923	u5138	m341	CHRIS	So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
L197922	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
L197921	u5144	m341	KARRAS	That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
L197920	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
L197919	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I'm Father Karras.
L197918	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Please go away.
L197917	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Chris MacNeil?
L198206	u5151	m341	REGAN	Hi Father.
L198205	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Honey this is Father Dyer.
L198204	u5151	m341	REGAN	All done.

L197714	u5138	m341	CHRIS	So something please Doctor, Help her!

L197673	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Honey it's to help you.
L197672	u5151	m341	REGAN	I don't want it.
L197658	u5151	m341	REGAN	Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
L197657	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh my God!
L197559	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh, honey.
L197558	u5151	m341	REGAN	My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
L197557	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What are you doing here?
L197550	u5138	m341	CHRIS	God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
L197549	u5151	m341	REGAN	Why does God let us get tired?
L197548	u5138	m341	CHRIS	People get tired.
L197540	u5151	m341	REGAN	Okay.
L197539	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
L197538	u5151	m341	REGAN	How do you know?
L197537	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well your thinking's not so good.
L197536	u5151	m341	REGAN	I don't know, I just thought.
L197535	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh you did. What did you hear?
L197534	u5151	m341	REGAN	Well I heard differently.
L197533	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
L197532	u5151	m341	REGAN	Do you not like him like daddy?
L197531	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
L197530	u5151	m341	REGAN	But you like him.
L197529	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
L197528	u5151	m341	REGAN	What?
L197527	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
L197526	u5151	m341	REGAN	Your not gonna marry him are you?
L197525	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
L197524	u5151	m341	REGAN	You like him.
L197523	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
L197522	u5151	m341	REGAN	Well you know it's okay.
L197521	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Mr. Dennings?
L197520	u5151	m341	REGAN	You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
L197519	u5138	m341	CHRIS	I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?

L197509	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
L197508	u5151	m341	REGAN	I wouldn't talk.
L197507	u5138	m341	CHRIS	It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
L197506	u5151	m341	REGAN	Cause I like it.
L197505	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Regan, why are you reading that?
L197504	u5151	m341	REGAN	You think?
L197503	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well, maybe he's sleeping.
L197502	u5151	m341	REGAN	Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
L197501	u5151	m341	REGAN	Here I'll show you.
L197500	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh I bet he is.

L197487	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You know how?
L197486	u5151	m341	REGAN	Yeah.
L197485	u5138	m341	CHRIS	You've been playing with it?
L197484	u5151	m341	REGAN	The closet
L197483	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Where?
L197482	u5151	m341	REGAN	I found it.
L197481	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Hey, where'd this come from?
L197479	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh it's so funny.
L197478	u5151	m341	REGAN	You like it?
L197477	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh look at that.
L197449	u5138	m341	CHRIS	We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
L197448	u5151	m341	REGAN	When can I have one?
L197447	u5138	m341	CHRIS	We'll see when we get home okay.
L197446	u5151	m341	REGAN	Oh............
L197445	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Well, not while we're in Washington.
L197442	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Your kidding?
L197441	u5151	m341	REGAN	Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
L197440	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
L197439	u5151	m341	REGAN	Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
L197438	u5151	m341	REGAN	Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
L197437	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What kind of stuff?
L197436	u5151	m341	REGAN	Um........Stuff.
L197435	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What did you do today?
L198210	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Okay.
L198209	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Goodbye Father. I call you.
L198203	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	That's good.
L198202	u5138	m341	CHRIS	She doesn't remeber a thing.
L197642	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
L197641	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
L197640	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Hi Chris. Great party.
L197630	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
L197629	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Karras.
L197628	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Damien Karras.
L197627	u5138	m341	CHRIS	What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
L197626	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	St. Mike's.
L197625	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
L197733	u5141	m341	DR. TANNEY	What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
L197732	u5138	m341	CHRIS	Oh, Christ.
L197731	u5141	m341	DR. TANNEY	A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
L197730	u5138	m341	CHRIS	So what's next?
L197729	u5141	m341	DR. TANNEY	There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
L197726	u5138	m341	CHRIS	So what's wrong with her?
L197725	u5141	m341	DR. TANNEY	Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
L197671	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Stealing is a sin.
L197670	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Goodnight Dims.
L197669	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
L197668	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
L197667	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Think you can sleep?
L197666	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
L197665	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
L197664	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
L197663	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I believe you.
L197662	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	I stole it.
L197661	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Where'd you get it then?
L197660	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
L197659	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
L198234	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	No.
L198233	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Another one. Had your lunch?
L198232	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	I've seen it.
L198231	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
L198230	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Who's in it?
L198229	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Withering Heights.
L198228	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	What's playing.
L198227	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
L198226	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Sure.
L198225	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Do you like films?
L198223	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Good bye.
L198222	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
L198221	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	She seemed fine.
L198220	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	How's the girl?
L198219	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	You just missed them.
L198218	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	I came to say goodbye.
L198217	u5142	m341	FATHER DYER	Lieutenant?
L198060	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Uoy era ohw.
L198059	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!

L198025	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Holy water.
L198024	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	What's that?
L198023	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
L198022	u5144	m341	KARRAS	How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
L198021	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	La plume de ma tante.
L198020	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Quod nomen mihi est?
L198019	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Bon Jour.
L198018	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Quod nomen mihi est?
L198017	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Ego te abslovo.
L198016	u5144	m341	KARRAS	You speak Latin?
L198015	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
L198014	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No now.
L198013	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	In time.
L198012	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Do it again.
L198011	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Uh Huh.
L198010	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Did you do that?
L198009	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	You and us.
L198008	u5144	m341	KARRAS	You and Regan?
L198007	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	It would bring us together.
L198006	u5144	m341	KARRAS	But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
L198005	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Intensely.
L198004	u5144	m341	KARRAS	You'd like that?
L198003	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	What an excellent day for an exorcism.
L198002	u5144	m341	KARRAS	"He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said ""Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body."" When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said ""Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith""."
L197983	u5144	m341	KARRAS	If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
L197982	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
L197980	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
L197979	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	In here. With us.
L197978	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Where's Regan?
L197977	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
L197976	u5144	m341	KARRAS	If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
L197975	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
L197974	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
L197973	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	I'm not Regan.
L197972	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
L197971	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	You might loosen the straps then.
L197970	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
L197475	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
L197474	u5147	m341	MRS.KARRAS	You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
L197473	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No momma.
L197472	u5147	m341	MRS.KARRAS	Dimmy, you worry for something?
L197470	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
L197469	u5147	m341	MRS.KARRAS	Okay
L197468	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
L197467	u5147	m341	MRS.KARRAS	No.
L197466	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Is that too tight?
L197465	u5147	m341	MRS.KARRAS	Last month.
L197464	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Oh really, when?
L197463	u5147	m341	MRS.KARRAS	Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
L197460	u5144	m341	KARRAS	How's your leg?
L197459	u5147	m341	MRS.KARRAS	I'm all right.
L198176	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Don't listen.
L198175	u5144	m341	KARRAS	You're not my mother!!!
L198174	u5144	m341	KARRAS	She'll go into coma.
L198173	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Can you give her something?
L198172	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Her heart.
L198171	u5146	m341	MERRIN	What is it?
L198165	u5146	m341	MERRIN	I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
L198164	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Why this girl it makes no sense?
L198149	u5146	m341	MERRIN	... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
L198148	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Shut up!!
L198145	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Defender of the human race...
L198144	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Amen.
L198134	u5144	m341	KARRAS	And also with you.
L198133	u5146	m341	MERRIN	The Lord be with you.
L198132	u5144	m341	KARRAS	And let my cry come unto thee.
L198131	u5146	m341	MERRIN	See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
L198130	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Amen
L198129	u5146	m341	MERRIN	...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
L198126	u5144	m341	KARRAS	And let my cry come unto thee.
L198125	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
L198124	u5146	m341	MERRIN	O'Lord hear my preyer.
L198123	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Amen
L198122	u5146	m341	MERRIN	...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
L198120	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
L198119	u5144	m341	KARRAS	And also with you.
L198118	u5146	m341	MERRIN	The Lord be with you.
L198117	u5144	m341	KARRAS	And let my cry come unto thee.
L198114	u5144	m341	KARRAS	And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
L198113	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Let the enemy have no power over her.
L198112	u5144	m341	KARRAS	In the face of the enemy.
L198111	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
L198110	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Who places her trust in thee, my God.
L198109	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Save your servant
L198108	u5144	m341	KARRAS	As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
L198107	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
L198106	u5144	m341	KARRAS	But deliver us from the evil one.
L198105	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
L198101	u5146	m341	MERRIN	There's only one.
L198100	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
L198099	u5146	m341	MERRIN	We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
L198097	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Why?
L198096	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
L198095	u5146	m341	MERRIN	I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
L198094	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No.
L197839	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	I could have you deported, you know that?
L197838	u5144	m341	KARRAS	The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
L197837	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Who?
L197836	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Alright. You know who I think really did it?
L197835	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
L197834	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Come on!
L197833	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
L197832	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I've seen it.
L197831	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
L197830	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Who's in it?
L197829	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
L197828	u5144	m341	KARRAS	That's to bad.
L197827	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
L197826	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Very much.
L197825	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Hey, Father? You like movies?
L197824	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
L197823	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	No, I mentioned it only in passing.
L197822	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Is that a threat?
L197821	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
L197820	u5144	m341	KARRAS	No I probably wouldn't.
L197819	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
L197818	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I don't know anyone who fits the description.
L197817	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
L197816	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Sick priest, is that it?
L197815	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
L197814	u5144	m341	KARRAS	You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
L197813	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
L197812	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Unlikely.
L197811	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	It's possible. Possible however?
L197810	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
L197809	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
L197808	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Yeah, a fall.
L197807	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	And Dennings, you read how he died?
L197806	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
L197805	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church?you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
L197804	u5144	m341	KARRAS	From the psychiatric end.
L197803	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Really?
L197802	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I once did a paper on it
L197801	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
L197800	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Only what I read in the papers.
L197799	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
L197798	u5144	m341	KARRAS	I've seen him.
L197797	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
L197796	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Always.
L197795	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
L197794	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
L197793	u5144	m341	KARRAS	What's this about?
L197792	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
L197791	u5145	m341	KINDERMAN	No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
L197790	u5144	m341	KARRAS	Have we met?
L198147	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
L198146	u5146	m341	MERRIN	...look down in pity...
L198141	u5146	m341	MERRIN	...from this creature of God!!!
L198140	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
L198139	u5146	m341	MERRIN	...Be gone!!
L198138	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Fuck him!!!
L198137	u5146	m341	MERRIN	...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
L198136	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Shove it up your ass you faggot!
L198135	u5146	m341	MERRIN	I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
L198128	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Bastards! Stop!
L198127	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
L198116	u5146	m341	MERRIN	O'Lord hear my prey.
L198115	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
L198103	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Be silent!
L198102	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
L198093	u5146	m341	MERRIN	Are you tired?
L198092	u5152	m341	REGAN/DEMON	MERRIN!!!!!!!
L197574	u5148	m341	NURSE	Just a minute.
L197573	u5154	m341	UNCLE	Yes I am her brother, he's the son
L197572	u5148	m341	NURSE	Are you a relative?
L197571	u5154	m341	UNCLE	Yes
L197570	u5148	m341	NURSE	Do you have an appointment?
L197569	u5154	m341	UNCLE	We want to see Mrs. Karras.
L197568	u5148	m341	NURSE	Yes?
L197567	u5154	m341	UNCLE	Miss?
L197784	u5151	m341	REGAN	Yes.
L197783	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
L197782	u5151	m341	REGAN	I'm afraid.
L197781	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	Why not?
L197780	u5151	m341	REGAN	No.
L197779	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
L197778	u5151	m341	REGAN	I don't know.
L197777	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	Is it Captain Howdy?
L197776	u5151	m341	REGAN	I don't know.
L197775	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	Who is it?
L197774	u5151	m341	REGAN	Sometimes.
L197773	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	Is there someone inside you?
L197772	u5151	m341	REGAN	Twelve.
L197771	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	How old are you?
L197770	u5151	m341	REGAN	Yes.
L197769	u5150	m341	PSYCHIATRIST	Are you comfortable Regan?
L215510	u5273	m349	CLEAR	I have to save Eugene!
L215509	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	No!  It can't be.
L215500	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
L215499	u5273	m349	CLEAR	What did you see?
L215464	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
L215463	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Speed up.
L215462	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	What do you want me to do?
L215452	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
L215451	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Another premonition?
L215450	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
L215449	u5273	m349	CLEAR	What did you see?  What am I looking for?
L215441	u5273	m349	CLEAR	I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
L215440	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
L215431	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
L215430	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Six duds in a row.
L215429	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
L215428	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
L215427	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
L215426	u5273	m349	CLEAR	What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
L215416	u5273	m349	CLEAR	How you doing in there, hero?
L215415	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	What about that?
L215205	u5273	m349	CLEAR	So let's do it.
L215204	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
L215203	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Please, what else could it mean?
L215198	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
L215197	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
L215196	u5273	m349	CLEAR	You were there?
L215195	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
L215193	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I...I...
L215192	u5273	m349	CLEAR	You have to tell us now.
L215159	u5273	m349	CLEAR	I hope you're ready for this.
L215158	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
L215118	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
L215117	u5273	m349	CLEAR	I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
L215115	u5273	m349	CLEAR	That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
L215114	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
L215113	u5273	m349	CLEAR	If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
L215112	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Signs?
L215111	u5273	m349	CLEAR	That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
L215107	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
L215106	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
L215105	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
L215103	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
L215102	u5273	m349	CLEAR	The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
L215101	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
L215100	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	What list?
L215099	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
L215098	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
L215097	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
L215096	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
L215095	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Yeah, how?
L215094	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
L215093	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
L215494	u5273	m349	CLEAR	She had the baby?
L215493	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Don't sweat it.  It's over.
L215492	u5273	m349	CLEAR	A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
L215443	u5273	m349	CLEAR	If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
L215442	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
L215221	u5273	m349	CLEAR	We need to hurry.
L215220	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
L215215	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Taken care of.
L215214	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
L215200	u5273	m349	CLEAR	"Holy shit.  He said ""only new life can defeat death.""  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design..."
L215199	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
L215164	u5273	m349	CLEAR	He probably already knows we're coming.
L215163	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Should we knock?
L215162	u5273	m349	CLEAR	A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
L215376	u5273	m349	CLEAR	That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
L215375	u5276	m349	EUGENE	So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
L215374	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
L215373	u5276	m349	EUGENE	I'm not sure I understand.
L215326	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
L215325	u5276	m349	EUGENE	Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
L215272	u5276	m349	EUGENE	What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
L215271	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Random, sure.
L215270	u5276	m349	EUGENE	Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
L215367	u5273	m349	CLEAR	What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
L215366	u5284	m349	RORY	Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
L215365	u5273	m349	CLEAR	Carter.
L215364	u5284	m349	RORY	I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
L215266	u5273	m349	CLEAR	What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
L215265	u5284	m349	RORY	That lucky bastard.
L215264	u5273	m349	CLEAR	The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
L214971	u5274	m349	DANO	Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
L214970	u5277	m349	FRANKIE	Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
L214964	u5274	m349	DANO	Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
L214963	u5277	m349	FRANKIE	Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
L214957	u5277	m349	FRANKIE	Who?
L214956	u5274	m349	DANO	Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
L214955	u5277	m349	FRANKIE	A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
L214923	u5277	m349	FRANKIE	Yeah, you should have specified.
L214922	u5274	m349	DANO	Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
L214917	u5274	m349	DANO	Blow me.
L214916	u5277	m349	FRANKIE	Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
L215061	u5275	m349	DETECTIVE SUBY	Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
L215060	u5287	m349	THOMAS	What?
L215059	u5275	m349	DETECTIVE SUBY	Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
L215058	u5287	m349	THOMAS	You've made your point.
L215031	u5275	m349	DETECTIVE SUBY	I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
L215030	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
L215029	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
L215028	u5275	m349	DETECTIVE SUBY	Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
L215381	u5278	m349	ISABELLA	Do you want to deliver this baby?
L215380	u5286	m349	STEVE	I've got to stop and help those people.
L215379	u5278	m349	ISABELLA	Please.  It's not going to wait.
L215346	u5278	m349	ISABELLA	Take my van!
L215345	u5286	m349	STEVE	Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
L215341	u5278	m349	ISABELLA	Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
L215340	u5286	m349	STEVE	Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
L215339	u5278	m349	ISABELLA	"What do you mean ""grand theft auto?"" This is insane."
L215245	u5279	m349	JORGE	She did.
L215244	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
L215243	u5279	m349	JORGE	Take a guess.
L215242	u5287	m349	THOMAS	What was the fight about?
L215241	u5279	m349	JORGE	We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
L215230	u5279	m349	JORGE	No.  What's this about?
L215229	u5287	m349	THOMAS	May we come in?
L215228	u5279	m349	JORGE	Maybe.  What's this about?
L215227	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Are you Jorge Cruz?
L215225	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
L215224	u5279	m349	JORGE	What?
L215353	u5280	m349	KAT	I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
L215352	u5284	m349	RORY	Yeah, so what happened?
L215351	u5280	m349	KAT	I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
L215349	u5284	m349	RORY	But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
L215348	u5280	m349	KAT	Yeah?
L215347	u5284	m349	RORY	Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
L215275	u5284	m349	RORY	Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
L215274	u5280	m349	KAT	"Eighteen.  And it's ""Hebrew""."
L215273	u5284	m349	RORY	"Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means ""good luck"" in Jewish."
L215258	u5284	m349	RORY	Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
L215257	u5280	m349	KAT	This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
L215046	u5284	m349	RORY	Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
L215045	u5280	m349	KAT	First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
L215536	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
L215535	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
L215530	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I know.  I can feel it too.
L215529	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
L215522	u5287	m349	THOMAS	That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
L215521	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
L215505	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
L215504	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
L215503	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
L215502	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I don't...what if I made a mistake?
L215501	u5287	m349	THOMAS	But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
L215498	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I know how it feels to be dead.
L215497	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Are you okay?  You just face planted!
L215460	u5287	m349	THOMAS	No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
L215459	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Shouldn't we pull over?
L215454	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
L215453	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Kalarjian?
L215446	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I wasn't worried about us.
L215445	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
L215444	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
L215388	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
L215387	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Stop it, don't move him!
L215338	u5287	m349	THOMAS	You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
L215337	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	How do you know?
L215336	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
L215279	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
L215278	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Whoa, nine months?
L215208	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
L215207	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
L215206	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
L215202	u5287	m349	THOMAS	It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
L215201	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
L215187	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
L215186	u5287	m349	THOMAS	New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
L215161	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Who is this guy, anyway?
L215160	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	This is cheery.
L215152	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
L215151	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	We have to tell her she's in danger!
L215150	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
L215139	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Hold on.
L215138	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
L215131	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
L215130	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I'm not following you --
L215129	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
L215127	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Clean up?  I don't...
L215126	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
L215125	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
L215124	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
L215123	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Evan Shaeffer's dead.
L215122	u5287	m349	THOMAS	I tried calling last night but your father --
L215020	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	...My Premonition was just like his.
L215019	u5287	m349	THOMAS	You mean Alex Browning.
L215017	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Like what?
L215016	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	"Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling ""pile up"" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... "
L215012	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
L215011	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Do you remember what triggered it all?
L215010	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
L215009	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Tell me again how it started.
L214997	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
L214996	u5287	m349	THOMAS	Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
L214995	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
L214987	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
L214986	u5287	m349	THOMAS	What's going on here?
L214978	u5285	m349	SHAINA	For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
L214977	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
L214976	u5285	m349	SHAINA	Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
L214974	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
L214973	u5285	m349	SHAINA	What is it?  What are you?
L214967	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
L214966	u5285	m349	SHAINA	What is it?  What are you?
L214960	u5285	m349	SHAINA	How does a nice mature fuck sound?
L214959	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
L214945	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I can live with thaaaa --
L214944	u5285	m349	SHAINA	Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
L214943	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
L214915	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	No, I'm good.
L214914	u5285	m349	SHAINA	Want me to drive?
L215333	u5284	m349	RORY	Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
L215332	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I guess so.
L215331	u5284	m349	RORY	And you're gonna die after me, right?
L215330	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I...I don't know.
L215329	u5284	m349	RORY	When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
L215328	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Sure.
L215327	u5284	m349	RORY	Can I ask you a question?
L215277	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
L215276	u5284	m349	RORY	The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
L215015	u5284	m349	RORY	Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
L215014	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
L215084	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
L215083	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
L215082	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
L215080	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
L215079	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
L215049	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	That it's not over yet.
L215048	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	What feeling?
L215047	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
L214929	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
L214928	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	I mean it.  Take care of it.
L214927	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
L214926	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
L214925	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Hey, Dad.  What's up?
L214924	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	Kimberly?  It's Dad.
L214909	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I know, Dad.
L214908	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
L214907	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	I know, honey.  I just --
L214906	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
L214902	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
L214901	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
L214900	u5282	m349	MR. BURROUGHS	You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
L214899	u5281	m349	KIMBERLY	Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
L215133	u5283	m349	NORA	Nice try, kiddo.
L215132	u5288	m349	TIM	You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
L215074	u5288	m349	TIM	You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
L215073	u5283	m349	NORA	Yeah?
L215072	u5288	m349	TIM	Mom?
L215038	u5288	m349	TIM	Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
L215037	u5283	m349	NORA	You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
L214992	u5288	m349	TIM	Who am I, David Blane?
L214991	u5283	m349	NORA	What on Earth are they doing?
L214952	u5283	m349	NORA	I know, we'll be there soon.
L214951	u5288	m349	TIM	Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
L214883	u5289	m350	ALEX	When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
L214882	u5292	m350	CLEAR	No! No! Don't!
L214881	u5289	m350	ALEX	You know what to do.
L214852	u5289	m350	ALEX	That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
L214851	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Police are coming.
L214833	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Get out! Get out of the car!
L214832	u5289	m350	ALEX	Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
L214829	u5289	m350	ALEX	Don't do it! Don't do it!
L214828	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Carter, get out!
L214827	u5289	m350	ALEX	Easy, Billy, just open it.
L214826	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Can't you open the door?!
L214820	u5289	m350	ALEX	Let us out!
L214819	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Stop the car!
L214787	u5289	m350	ALEX	They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
L214786	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
L214783	u5292	m350	CLEAR	We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
L214782	u5289	m350	ALEX	I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
L214781	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Nothing is... anymore.
L214780	u5289	m350	ALEX	No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
L214779	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
L214771	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Most kids never have it happen.
L214770	u5289	m350	ALEX	Most kids do, I guess.
L214679	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
L214678	u5289	m350	ALEX	No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
L214677	u5292	m350	CLEAR	I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
L214672	u5292	m350	CLEAR	That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
L214671	u5289	m350	ALEX	I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
L214668	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
L214667	u5289	m350	ALEX	Right. April 25th.
L214666	u5292	m350	CLEAR	4:25.
L214664	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Like... 4:25.
L214663	u5289	m350	ALEX	Remember the departure time?
L214662	u5289	m350	ALEX	Thirty-nine.
L214661	u5292	m350	CLEAR	No.
L214660	u5289	m350	ALEX	Remember the gate number?
L214659	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Thirty-nine.
L214658	u5289	m350	ALEX	How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
L214657	u5292	m350	CLEAR	As in flannels and plaids?
L214656	u5289	m350	ALEX	He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
L214626	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
L214625	u5289	m350	ALEX	Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
L214624	u5289	m350	ALEX	That's him, but... he's not here.
L214623	u5292	m350	CLEAR	I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
L214622	u5289	m350	ALEX	That... him?
L214620	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
L214619	u5289	m350	ALEX	This place?!
L214616	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Then, let's go see him!
L214615	u5289	m350	ALEX	I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
L214614	u5292	m350	CLEAR	"Is that something you're ""feeling?"""
L214613	u5289	m350	ALEX	What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
L214612	u5292	m350	CLEAR	It?
L214611	u5289	m350	ALEX	I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
L214610	u5292	m350	CLEAR	That's why I was there last night.
L214606	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
L214605	u5289	m350	ALEX	I'm... really sorry.
L214604	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
L214598	u5292	m350	CLEAR	It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
L214597	u5289	m350	ALEX	You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
L214593	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
L214592	u5289	m350	ALEX	It's only the end of June.
L214521	u5292	m350	CLEAR	He's not a witch.
L214520	u5289	m350	ALEX	How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
L214855	u5289	m350	ALEX	Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
L214854	u5291	m350	CARTER	Intervention? What are you, God now?!
L214853	u5289	m350	ALEX	My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
L214850	u5289	m350	ALEX	But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
L214849	u5291	m350	CARTER	You're the fuckin' devil.
L214848	u5289	m350	ALEX	You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
L214810	u5289	m350	ALEX	No!
L214809	u5291	m350	CARTER	What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
L214801	u5289	m350	ALEX	It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
L214800	u5291	m350	CARTER	You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
L214799	u5289	m350	ALEX	Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
L214785	u5289	m350	ALEX	Why do you think I was hiding?
L214784	u5291	m350	CARTER	Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
L214692	u5289	m350	ALEX	Look, there's something you should all know.
L214691	u5291	m350	CARTER	We're losing our favorite teacher.
L214557	u5291	m350	CARTER	All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
L214556	u5289	m350	ALEX	I don't.
L214555	u5291	m350	CARTER	Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
L214517	u5289	m350	ALEX	I wish you were on the plane!
L214516	u5291	m350	CARTER	You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
L214490	u5289	m350	ALEX	Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
L214489	u5291	m350	CARTER	I'll remove him.
L214570	u5289	m350	ALEX	That's a plan.
L214569	u5294	m350	TOD	Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
L214509	u5294	m350	TOD	Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
L214508	u5289	m350	ALEX	And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
L214465	u5294	m350	TOD	"Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' ""Stepmom."""
L214464	u5289	m350	ALEX	C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
L214463	u5294	m350	TOD	Fag.
L214448	u5294	m350	TOD	Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
L214447	u5289	m350	ALEX	Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
L214731	u5289	m350	ALEX	No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
L214730	u5295	m350	WEINE	Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
L214719	u5295	m350	WEINE	Oh, you've noticed it, too?
L214718	u5289	m350	ALEX	Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
L214717	u5295	m350	WEINE	Next?
L214716	u5289	m350	ALEX	I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
L214531	u5289	m350	ALEX	No. I saw it. I saw it!
L214530	u5295	m350	WEINE	Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
L214529	u5289	m350	ALEX	I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
L214650	u5293	m350	MR. BLUDWORTH	No harm. No foul.
L214649	u5289	m350	ALEX	I'm sorry we broke in.
L214645	u5289	m350	ALEX	Design?
L214644	u5293	m350	MR. BLUDWORTH	You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
L214642	u5289	m350	ALEX	You saying Tod did kill himself?
L214641	u5293	m350	MR. BLUDWORTH	... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
L214640	u5293	m350	MR. BLUDWORTH	In Death...
L214639	u5289	m350	ALEX	His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
L214637	u5289	m350	ALEX	Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
L214636	u5293	m350	MR. BLUDWORTH	Cuticle lacerations.
L214632	u5293	m350	MR. BLUDWORTH	I know who you are.
L214631	u5289	m350	ALEX	I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
L214838	u5290	m350	BILLY	No one's that strong.
L214837	u5291	m350	CARTER	It broke!
L214796	u5291	m350	CARTER	Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
L214795	u5290	m350	BILLY	Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
L214794	u5291	m350	CARTER	Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
L214793	u5290	m350	BILLY	Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
L214763	u5291	m350	CARTER	'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
L214762	u5290	m350	BILLY	Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
L214761	u5291	m350	CARTER	Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
L214760	u5290	m350	BILLY	And don't pass on the right.
L214842	u5292	m350	CLEAR	WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
L214841	u5291	m350	CARTER	SHUT UP, BILLY!
L214817	u5291	m350	CARTER	I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
L214816	u5292	m350	CLEAR	I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
L214815	u5291	m350	CARTER	That's what I'm doin'!
L214814	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Get control of yourself!
L214806	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Not with us in the fuckin' car!
L214805	u5291	m350	CARTER	May as well go out under my own free will, right?
L214804	u5292	m350	CLEAR	Knock it off!
L214798	u5291	m350	CARTER	You have a responsibility to tell me.
L214797	u5292	m350	CLEAR	He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
L214754	u5292	m350	CLEAR	They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
L214753	u5291	m350	CARTER	So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
L214752	u5291	m350	CARTER	Terry's name should be on this wall.
L214751	u5292	m350	CLEAR	What are you doing?
L225816	u5403	m359	ABEL	He wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
L225815	u5410	m359	SHELLY	That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
L225814	u5403	m359	ABEL	"I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe ""he"" wanted me to have this..."
L225813	u5410	m359	SHELLY	What is that?
L225811	u5403	m359	ABEL	Drop me off?  How do you mean?
L225810	u5410	m359	SHELLY	I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
L225809	u5403	m359	ABEL	Going?  How do you mean?
L225808	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Where are you going?
L225807	u5403	m359	ABEL	My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
L226011	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
L226010	u5404	m359	ANDY	You're all just jealous.
L226007	u5404	m359	ANDY	I did?!  I broke the world's record.
L226006	u5410	m359	SHELLY	According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
L226005	u5404	m359	ANDY	... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
L225988	u5410	m359	SHELLY	We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
L225987	u5404	m359	ANDY	Who brought up this bright idea?
L225877	u5404	m359	ANDY	Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
L225876	u5410	m359	SHELLY	No more... I can't!
L225744	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
L225743	u5404	m359	ANDY	Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
L225742	u5404	m359	ANDY	Same thing.
L225741	u5410	m359	SHELLY	I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
L225740	u5404	m359	ANDY	Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
L226063	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Sure.
L226062	u5404	m359	ANDY	Do you want a beer or not?
L226060	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	What?
L226059	u5404	m359	ANDY	I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
L226058	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Barely.
L226057	u5404	m359	ANDY	Hey Deb... can you hear me?
L226056	u5404	m359	ANDY	You're too clean for me.
L226055	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	"I think it's called ""a shower"". You might try it sometime."
L226054	u5404	m359	ANDY	What're you doin'?
L226052	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	I vote for the hammock.
L226051	u5404	m359	ANDY	I vote for me.
L226050	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
L226024	u5404	m359	ANDY	I'll think of something.
L226023	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Think you can figure it out?
L226022	u5404	m359	ANDY	I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
L226021	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
L226020	u5404	m359	ANDY	How do we do it?
L225990	u5404	m359	ANDY	If you insist.
L225989	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
L225982	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
L225981	u5404	m359	ANDY	How about a roll in the hay?
L225980	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Not now.  I'm cold.
L225979	u5404	m359	ANDY	We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
L225978	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	What're you doing?
L225959	u5404	m359	ANDY	Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
L225958	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
L225957	u5404	m359	ANDY	I don't know...
L225956	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Why don't we go take a swim?
L225881	u5404	m359	ANDY	Where's Shelly?
L225880	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	What was that?
L225785	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
L225784	u5404	m359	ANDY	Breakfast?
L225734	u5404	m359	ANDY	I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
L225733	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Cool it, Andy.
L225732	u5404	m359	ANDY	So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
L225728	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
L225727	u5404	m359	ANDY	What're you gonna do?
L226090	u5405	m359	CHILI	Be a man, man.
L226089	u5407	m359	CHUCK	Will you come with me?
L226088	u5405	m359	CHILI	Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
L226087	u5407	m359	CHUCK	Don't do that to me!
L226086	u5405	m359	CHILI	Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
L226085	u5407	m359	CHUCK	What's the matter?!
L226084	u5405	m359	CHILI	It's Friday the 13th.
L226083	u5407	m359	CHUCK	I can't even remember what day it is, man.
L226082	u5405	m359	CHILI	I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
L225944	u5405	m359	CHILI	This is all the exercise I need...
L225943	u5407	m359	CHUCK	Maybe we should do some exercise.
L225851	u5407	m359	CHUCK	And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
L225850	u5405	m359	CHILI	That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
L225849	u5407	m359	CHUCK	It's dark down there.
L225798	u5407	m359	CHUCK	I love you, man!
L225797	u5405	m359	CHILI	I'm a slow eater.
L225795	u5405	m359	CHILI	Chuck... look.
L225794	u5407	m359	CHUCK	I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
L225779	u5405	m359	CHILI	Yes, man!
L225778	u5407	m359	CHUCK	Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
L225863	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Have you ever made love in a hammock?
L225862	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	A hammock?
L225861	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Your bed.
L225860	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	What's this?
L225825	u5406	m359	CHRIS	You go ahead...
L225824	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Come on down!
L225749	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
L225748	u5406	m359	CHRIS	What are they saying?
L225738	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
L225737	u5406	m359	CHRIS	I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
L225724	u5406	m359	CHRIS	It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
L225723	u5408	m359	DEBBIE	Which one is it?
L226074	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Sort of.
L226073	u5409	m359	DEREK	You know him?
L226071	u5409	m359	DEREK	Sure, just watch where you're going.
L226070	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Could we move a little faster?
L226027	u5409	m359	DEREK	It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
L226026	u5406	m359	CHRIS	When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
L226004	u5409	m359	DEREK	After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
L226003	u5406	m359	CHRIS	You promised you'd never ask me.
L226002	u5409	m359	DEREK	What happened that night?
L226001	u5406	m359	CHRIS	I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
L226000	u5409	m359	DEREK	I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
L225999	u5406	m359	CHRIS	I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
L225998	u5409	m359	DEREK	And, what about us?
L225997	u5406	m359	CHRIS	... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
L225996	u5409	m359	DEREK	Why did you come back here?
L225995	u5406	m359	CHRIS	The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
L225994	u5409	m359	DEREK	What do you mean?
L225993	u5406	m359	CHRIS	It's deceiving.
L225992	u5409	m359	DEREK	You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
L225954	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
L225953	u5409	m359	DEREK	This is too painful to look at.
L225887	u5406	m359	CHRIS	No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
L225886	u5409	m359	DEREK	Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
L225885	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Are you all right, Shelly?
L225884	u5409	m359	DEREK	Shelly!  Where are you?!
L225872	u5406	m359	CHRIS	I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
L225871	u5409	m359	DEREK	Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
L225870	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Somebody was in here.
L225869	u5409	m359	DEREK	No.  I got here just before you did.
L225868	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Did you stay here last night?
L225867	u5409	m359	DEREK	Look what I found.  Remember these?
L225845	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Nothing.
L225844	u5409	m359	DEREK	What?
L225843	u5406	m359	CHRIS	This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
L225840	u5409	m359	DEREK	Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
L225839	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
L225838	u5409	m359	DEREK	You're irresistible.  I lose control.
L225837	u5406	m359	CHRIS	I don't know.
L225836	u5409	m359	DEREK	Is that so bad?
L225835	u5406	m359	CHRIS	You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
L225834	u5409	m359	DEREK	Hello.  How are you?
L225833	u5406	m359	CHRIS	"You can say... ""Hello, how are you?""... for starters."
L225832	u5409	m359	DEREK	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
L225831	u5406	m359	CHRIS	You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
L225830	u5409	m359	DEREK	Why?
L225829	u5406	m359	CHRIS	Derek... stop.
L226042	u5411	m359	VERA	You're wrong.
L226041	u5410	m359	SHELLY	You don't to say it.  I can tell.
L226040	u5411	m359	VERA	"I never said you were ""nothing""."
L226039	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
L226038	u5411	m359	VERA	I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
L226037	u5410	m359	SHELLY	I just want you to like me.
L226036	u5411	m359	VERA	"You don't ""have to."""
L226035	u5410	m359	SHELLY	I have to.
L226034	u5411	m359	VERA	Why do you do these stupid things?!
L226033	u5411	m359	VERA	Damn you, Shelly!
L226032	u5410	m359	SHELLY	You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
L226018	u5411	m359	VERA	Don't say any more.
L226017	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
L225952	u5410	m359	SHELLY	A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
L225951	u5411	m359	VERA	We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
L225949	u5410	m359	SHELLY	It was nothing.
L225948	u5411	m359	VERA	We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
L225942	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
L225941	u5411	m359	VERA	This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
L225940	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Stop the car!  Now!!
L225939	u5411	m359	VERA	Bullseye!
L225938	u5411	m359	VERA	You're the boss.
L225937	u5410	m359	SHELLY	"No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell ""stop,"" you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?"
L225936	u5411	m359	VERA	What're you doing?
L225935	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Just keep your eyes on the road.
L225934	u5411	m359	VERA	This is no time to celebrate!
L225933	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Maybe.
L225932	u5411	m359	VERA	Got any good ideas?
L225928	u5411	m359	VERA	Keep looking.
L225927	u5410	m359	SHELLY	I don't see anything.
L225925	u5411	m359	VERA	Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
L225924	u5410	m359	SHELLY	"Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that ""next time"" isn't too soon."
L225923	u5411	m359	VERA	See anything?
L225920	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Gulp!
L225919	u5411	m359	VERA	Yes.
L225918	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Are they following us?
L225914	u5411	m359	VERA	May be please have the wallet.
L225913	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Please... be cool.
L225906	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
L225905	u5411	m359	VERA	Everything's gonna be fine.
L225904	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Is... is everything all right?
L225804	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Not us!  He's really creepy.
L225803	u5411	m359	VERA	Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
L225802	u5410	m359	SHELLY	That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
L225789	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
L225788	u5411	m359	VERA	Why don't you help us?
L225787	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Faster!  Eat faster!
L225777	u5411	m359	VERA	Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
L225776	u5410	m359	SHELLY	What are we gonna do?
L225773	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Stick around and you'll see.
L225772	u5411	m359	VERA	In that little thing?
L225771	u5410	m359	SHELLY	My whole world.
L225770	u5411	m359	VERA	What d'ya got in there?
L225755	u5410	m359	SHELLY	I'm sorry.
L225754	u5411	m359	VERA	You're Shelly?
L225753	u5410	m359	SHELLY	Hi.
L226327	u5412	m360	CORT	No way...  ...I wanna rock!
L226326	u5415	m360	JILL	That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
L226318	u5412	m360	CORT	Alright, alright.
L226317	u5415	m360	JILL	Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
L226315	u5412	m360	CORT	What?  Who pulled it out?!
L226314	u5415	m360	JILL	Go out and plug the cord back in.
L226313	u5412	m360	CORT	What?
L226311	u5415	m360	JILL	My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
L226310	u5412	m360	CORT	Who's Horace?
L226309	u5415	m360	JILL	If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
L226308	u5415	m360	JILL	Great.  Just great.
L226307	u5412	m360	CORT	I thought that was the end of the song.
L226165	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
L226164	u5413	m360	DARREN	Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
L226161	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
L226160	u5413	m360	DARREN	Oh, jeez.
L226158	u5413	m360	DARREN	Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
L226157	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
L226156	u5413	m360	DARREN	That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
L226155	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	We're gonna scare him?!
L226154	u5413	m360	DARREN	Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
L226150	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
L226149	u5413	m360	DARREN	Why?
L226148	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	Darren, we better turn around.
L226145	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
L226144	u5413	m360	DARREN	"You admit the sign did say ""Camp Forest Green,"" with an arrow pointing this way."
L226143	u5418	m360	LIZBETH	Well, who told me to take this cow path?
L226142	u5413	m360	DARREN	Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
L226431	u5414	m360	DEPUTY	Sheriff, you better take this.
L226430	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
L226370	u5414	m360	DEPUTY	Happy Friday the 13th.
L226369	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Whaddya mean?
L226368	u5414	m360	DEPUTY	He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
L226367	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
L226366	u5414	m360	DEPUTY	I wish it was.
L226365	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Is that all you found?
L226244	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Better call an ambulance first.
L226243	u5414	m360	DEPUTY	Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
L226242	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
L226231	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
L226230	u5414	m360	DEPUTY	He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
L226229	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
L226239	u5416	m360	KATIE	I could swear I heard...
L226238	u5424	m360	STAN	Ahh, nothing.
L226235	u5424	m360	STAN	Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
L226234	u5416	m360	KATIE	Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
L226233	u5424	m360	STAN	You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
L226232	u5416	m360	KATIE	Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
L226204	u5416	m360	KATIE	See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
L226203	u5424	m360	STAN	Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
L226202	u5416	m360	KATIE	....with a woman's touch.
L226206	u5424	m360	STAN	It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
L226205	u5417	m360	LARRY	Never should've let her play.
L226201	u5424	m360	STAN	This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
L226200	u5417	m360	LARRY	You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
L226199	u5424	m360	STAN	Yeah, that's fat too.
L226198	u5417	m360	LARRY	My ass.
L226197	u5424	m360	STAN	That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
L226196	u5417	m360	LARRY	This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
L226195	u5424	m360	STAN	Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
L226440	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
L226439	u5419	m360	MEGAN	No.  No, it's not...
L226436	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
L226435	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Daddy, what is going on?
L226434	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
L226427	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
L226426	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
L226423	u5419	m360	MEGAN	All he's asking is for you to check it out.
L226422	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	...And I said, shut up!
L226349	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
L226348	u5419	m360	MEGAN	I thought Jason was only a legend?
L226347	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
L226346	u5419	m360	MEGAN	What it is?
L226337	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
L226336	u5419	m360	MEGAN	How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
L226335	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
L226334	u5419	m360	MEGAN	When are you going to stop treating me like one!
L226189	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
L226188	u5419	m360	MEGAN	But, Dad, we...
L226182	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
L226181	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Jason who?
L226173	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
L226172	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
L226524	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
L226523	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Did you hear me?!
L226522	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
L226504	u5425	m360	TOMMY	I hope so.
L226503	u5419	m360	MEGAN	They did show up.  Isn't that great?
L226492	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
L226491	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Lake Forest Green?
L226490	u5425	m360	TOMMY	It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
L226489	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
L226478	u5425	m360	TOMMY	I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
L226477	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Wait a minute. I just...
L226476	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
L226464	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Come and get it.
L226463	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Okay, give it back.
L226462	u5425	m360	TOMMY	'Cause it stinks.
L226461	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Why?
L226460	u5425	m360	TOMMY	No.
L226459	u5419	m360	MEGAN	There...Ya happy?
L226456	u5419	m360	MEGAN	What's it to ya?
L226455	u5425	m360	TOMMY	So what are ya drawin'?
L226405	u5425	m360	TOMMY	It's just beginning.
L226404	u5419	m360	MEGAN	It's all over.
L226387	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Okay.  There's one.
L226386	u5419	m360	MEGAN	You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
L226383	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
L226382	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Uh...yes.  But...
L226381	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
L226379	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
L226378	u5425	m360	TOMMY	What?
L226354	u5425	m360	TOMMY	I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
L226353	u5419	m360	MEGAN	Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
L226352	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
L226450	u5421	m360	PAULA	Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
L226449	u5420	m360	NANCY	But what I get scared again?
L226448	u5421	m360	PAULA	I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
L226420	u5421	m360	PAULA	We'll scare 'em right back.
L226419	u5420	m360	NANCY	But what if they try and scare us?
L226417	u5420	m360	NANCY	Who ya calling?
L226416	u5421	m360	PAULA	I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
L226414	u5420	m360	NANCY	Huh?
L226413	u5421	m360	PAULA	That's debatable.
L226412	u5420	m360	NANCY	Are they grown-ups?
L226411	u5421	m360	PAULA	Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
L226410	u5420	m360	NANCY	Why?
L226409	u5421	m360	PAULA	You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
L226408	u5420	m360	NANCY	I found it outside.
L226407	u5421	m360	PAULA	Where'd you get this?
L226294	u5420	m360	NANCY	No more.
L226293	u5421	m360	PAULA	...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
L226292	u5421	m360	PAULA	Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
L226291	u5420	m360	NANCY	Nancy.
L226290	u5421	m360	PAULA	Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
L226289	u5420	m360	NANCY	No, he was real.  Like on TV.
L226288	u5421	m360	PAULA	You mean you had a bad dream.
L226285	u5420	m360	NANCY	There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
L226284	u5421	m360	PAULA	So what happened?
L226373	u5423	m360	SISSY	I think somebody's messin' around out there.
L226372	u5421	m360	PAULA	What's goin' on?
L226300	u5423	m360	SISSY	"Yeah, he was gonna check out ""things that go bump in the night."""
L226299	u5421	m360	PAULA	He didn't say anything?
L226298	u5423	m360	SISSY	I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
L226297	u5421	m360	PAULA	I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
L226283	u5423	m360	SISSY	Yeah, we're here.
L226282	u5421	m360	PAULA	Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
L226276	u5423	m360	SISSY	Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
L226275	u5421	m360	PAULA	No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
L226274	u5423	m360	SISSY	Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
L226273	u5421	m360	PAULA	Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
L226272	u5423	m360	SISSY	Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
L226264	u5421	m360	PAULA	You gotta be kidding!
L226263	u5423	m360	SISSY	Boy scouting.
L226262	u5421	m360	PAULA	Which is?
L226261	u5423	m360	SISSY	Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
L226260	u5421	m360	PAULA	So where's Cort gone off to?
L226176	u5423	m360	SISSY	All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
L226175	u5421	m360	PAULA	It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
L226429	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
L226428	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Doesn't that tell you something?!
L226425	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
L226424	u5425	m360	TOMMY	You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
L226397	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Please don't do anything crazy.
L226396	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
L226257	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
L226256	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
L226247	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
L226246	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	I've seen it.
L226245	u5425	m360	TOMMY	I gotta show you Jason's grave.
L226193	u5425	m360	TOMMY	But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
L226192	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
L226187	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
L226186	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Yes!
L226178	u5425	m360	TOMMY	I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
L226177	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
L226141	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
L226140	u5425	m360	TOMMY	You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
L226139	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
L226138	u5425	m360	TOMMY	If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
L226137	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
L226136	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Why didn't you cremate him?!
L226131	u5425	m360	TOMMY	There's no time for this bullshit...
L226130	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
L226127	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Yes, but they released me because...
L226126	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
L226125	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
L226124	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
L226123	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
L226122	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
L226121	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
L226120	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
L226119	u5425	m360	TOMMY	Will you listen, dammit!
L226118	u5422	m360	SHERIFF	Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
L226583	u5428	m361	DUKE	-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
L226582	u5426	m361	CAMPBELL	Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
L226580	u5428	m361	DUKE	Skin stretcher was human.
L226579	u5426	m361	CAMPBELL	I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
L226578	u5428	m361	DUKE	-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
L226577	u5426	m361	CAMPBELL	"In the media, you've frequently been described as ""salty"" --"
L226576	u5428	m361	DUKE	Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
L226575	u5426	m361	CAMPBELL	Well, let's hope not!
L226574	u5428	m361	DUKE	They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
L226573	u5426	m361	CAMPBELL	-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
L226572	u5428	m361	DUKE	Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
L226571	u5426	m361	CAMPBELL	Eight times.
L226570	u5428	m361	DUKE	How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
L226569	u5426	m361	CAMPBELL	Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
L226753	u5427	m361	DIANA	I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
L226752	u5433	m361	STEVEN	I'm here.
L226751	u5427	m361	DIANA	Steven...
L226750	u5427	m361	DIANA	Save your...
L226749	u5433	m361	STEVEN	The what?
L226748	u5427	m361	DIANA	You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
L226676	u5427	m361	DIANA	No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
L226675	u5433	m361	STEVEN	So let's talk.
L226674	u5427	m361	DIANA	...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
L226600	u5427	m361	DIANA	Yes.
L226599	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
L226650	u5427	m361	DIANA	That's it, we're done.
L226649	u5428	m361	DUKE	I know everything about you, Diana.
L226648	u5427	m361	DIANA	You need to leave.
L226647	u5428	m361	DUKE	You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
L226646	u5427	m361	DIANA	What do you want?
L226645	u5428	m361	DUKE	Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
L226644	u5427	m361	DIANA	Look, I don't want your money!
L226643	u5428	m361	DUKE	Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
L226642	u5427	m361	DIANA	Look --
L226641	u5428	m361	DUKE	Twenty.
L226640	u5427	m361	DIANA	No, I --
L226638	u5427	m361	DIANA	You food'll be right out.
L226637	u5428	m361	DUKE	You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
L226636	u5427	m361	DIANA	Jason Voorhees is dead.
L226635	u5428	m361	DUKE	I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
L226634	u5427	m361	DIANA	I'm kind of busy right now...
L226633	u5428	m361	DUKE	I need to talk to you.
L226632	u5427	m361	DIANA	I know who you are.
L226630	u5428	m361	DUKE	Yes.
L226629	u5427	m361	DIANA	Anything else?
L226740	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	June the 19th.
L226739	u5427	m361	DIANA	Hello...
L226653	u5427	m361	DIANA	N...nothing.
L226652	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	What's the problem here?
L226623	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Okay, I'll call you later.
L226622	u5427	m361	DIANA	I gotta get back to work.
L226620	u5427	m361	DIANA	Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
L226619	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
L226618	u5427	m361	DIANA	Ed...
L226615	u5427	m361	DIANA	Do you have to ask?
L226614	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Steven buggin' you?
L226613	u5427	m361	DIANA	Not so bad, today.
L226612	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Legs giving you trouble?
L226611	u5427	m361	DIANA	It's going.
L226610	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Everything going okay?
L226686	u5427	m361	DIANA	'Night, Josh.
L226685	u5430	m361	JOSH	Good night, beautiful.
L226684	u5427	m361	DIANA	Okay.
L226683	u5430	m361	JOSH	Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
L226682	u5430	m361	JOSH	So's he and he knows it.
L226681	u5427	m361	DIANA	I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
L226680	u5430	m361	JOSH	Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
L226679	u5427	m361	DIANA	It's...It's all right.
L226678	u5430	m361	JOSH	Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
L226677	u5427	m361	DIANA	Jesus!
L226840	u5428	m361	DUKE	You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
L226839	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Lock this asshole up.
L226838	u5428	m361	DUKE	Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
L226837	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Tell me!
L226836	u5428	m361	DUKE	Sorry.
L226835	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Tell me.
L226834	u5428	m361	DUKE	For a good reason.
L226833	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Why did you want her body?
L226829	u5428	m361	DUKE	That's what I'd like to know.
L226828	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
L226665	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
L226664	u5428	m361	DUKE	That's very colorful, chief.
L226663	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	"I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show ""bounty hunter"" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!"
L226662	u5428	m361	DUKE	Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
L226661	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Goddamnit!
L226660	u5428	m361	DUKE	She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
L226659	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	You're talking about my lady.
L226658	u5428	m361	DUKE	Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
L226657	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Get up!
L226656	u5428	m361	DUKE	Maybe you should mind your own business.
L226655	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Maybe you should be moving on.
L226797	u5434	m361	VICKI	Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
L226796	u5429	m361	JESSICA	Does he know about what happened?
L226795	u5429	m361	JESSICA	I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
L226794	u5434	m361	VICKI	Why didn't you tell me?
L226792	u5434	m361	VICKI	She's yours?
L226791	u5429	m361	JESSICA	Her name's Stephanie.
L226790	u5434	m361	VICKI	She's beautiful.
L226787	u5429	m361	JESSICA	That's all right.  I was just...
L226786	u5434	m361	VICKI	Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
L226811	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Okay.
L226810	u5431	m361	RANDY	I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
L226809	u5433	m361	STEVEN	What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
L226808	u5431	m361	RANDY	Don't do anything stupid.
L226807	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Okay.
L226806	u5431	m361	RANDY	I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
L226801	u5431	m361	RANDY	I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
L226800	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Are you crazy?!
L226799	u5431	m361	RANDY	I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
L226798	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Well?
L226735	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Gotta go.  See you guys later.
L226734	u5431	m361	RANDY	Yeah...
L226733	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Wanna know how I did that?
L226731	u5431	m361	RANDY	Have a good night.
L226730	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Randy, c'mon!
L226729	u5431	m361	RANDY	Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
L226728	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
L226719	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
L226718	u5431	m361	RANDY	I'm now begging you.
L226717	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
L226716	u5431	m361	RANDY	Oh my God, Steven.
L226715	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
L226714	u5431	m361	RANDY	Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
L226713	u5433	m361	STEVEN	...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
L226711	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Next, you dial a number.
L226710	u5431	m361	RANDY	Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
L226709	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
L226708	u5431	m361	RANDY	What are you doing?
L226702	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
L226701	u5431	m361	RANDY	It was a community service.
L226698	u5431	m361	RANDY	Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
L226697	u5433	m361	STEVEN	I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
L226696	u5431	m361	RANDY	Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
L226780	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
L226779	u5433	m361	STEVEN	She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
L226778	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
L226777	u5433	m361	STEVEN	She did!
L226776	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
L226775	u5433	m361	STEVEN	No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
L226774	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
L226773	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	-- Bad?!
L226772	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Look, I know I treated her bad --
L226771	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
L226770	u5433	m361	STEVEN	About Jessica.
L226769	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	About what?
L226768	u5433	m361	STEVEN	She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
L226767	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
L226766	u5433	m361	STEVEN	I didn't kill her!
L226765	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	You don't know shit!
L226764	u5433	m361	STEVEN	I know what it sounds like.
L226763	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
L226762	u5433	m361	STEVEN	I've told you the truth.
L226761	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Until I hear the truth.
L226760	u5433	m361	STEVEN	How many times do you want to hear this?
L226757	u5433	m361	STEVEN	He was dead.  He had to be dead...
L226756	u5432	m361	SHERIFF	Oh, my dear God...
L226724	u5434	m361	VICKI	A pizza?!
L226723	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
L226722	u5434	m361	VICKI	I'm literally going to kill you!
L226721	u5433	m361	STEVEN	She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
L226720	u5434	m361	VICKI	Steven!
L226700	u5433	m361	STEVEN	Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
L226699	u5434	m361	VICKI	That's disgusting.
L226695	u5433	m361	STEVEN	I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
L226694	u5434	m361	VICKI	I mean really never.
L226693	u5433	m361	STEVEN	You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
L226692	u5434	m361	VICKI	Never.
L226691	u5433	m361	STEVEN	What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
L227205	u5435	m362	EVA	I don't care about being hip anymore.
L227204	u5444	m362	WAYNE	So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
L227203	u5435	m362	EVA	But she might be in trouble...
L227202	u5444	m362	WAYNE	No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
L227201	u5435	m362	EVA	Have you seen Tamara?
L227200	u5435	m362	EVA	Jason...Voorhees?
L227199	u5444	m362	WAYNE	The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
L227198	u5435	m362	EVA	What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
L227073	u5443	m362	TAMARA	But...wait a minute!
L227072	u5435	m362	EVA	I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
L227071	u5443	m362	TAMARA	Time to check out the waiters.
L227070	u5435	m362	EVA	Yeah.
L227069	u5443	m362	TAMARA	That was truly excellent.
L227055	u5443	m362	TAMARA	Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
L227054	u5435	m362	EVA	What are you going to do?
L227044	u5443	m362	TAMARA	Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
L227043	u5435	m362	EVA	I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
L227042	u5443	m362	TAMARA	A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
L227036	u5443	m362	TAMARA	Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
L227035	u5435	m362	EVA	I guess not.
L227034	u5443	m362	TAMARA	You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
L227033	u5435	m362	EVA	It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
L227032	u5443	m362	TAMARA	What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
L227031	u5435	m362	EVA	No thanks.
L227024	u5443	m362	TAMARA	You're joking, right?
L227023	u5435	m362	EVA	Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
L227022	u5443	m362	TAMARA	I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
L227020	u5443	m362	TAMARA	My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
L227019	u5435	m362	EVA	My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
L227018	u5443	m362	TAMARA	He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
L226947	u5443	m362	TAMARA	Improvise, of course.
L226946	u5435	m362	EVA	What are you going to do?
L226945	u5443	m362	TAMARA	A major prick.
L226934	u5443	m362	TAMARA	More or less. It's part of my college fund.
L226933	u5435	m362	EVA	He bought you that?
L226932	u5443	m362	TAMARA	It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
L226931	u5443	m362	TAMARA	I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
L226930	u5435	m362	EVA	Really?
L226929	u5443	m362	TAMARA	I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
L226891	u5442	m362	SUZY	No.
L226890	u5436	m362	JIM	And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
L226889	u5442	m362	SUZY	And you'll never do it again.
L226888	u5436	m362	JIM	All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
L226881	u5436	m362	JIM	Hear what?
L226880	u5442	m362	SUZY	Did you hear that?
L226878	u5442	m362	SUZY	So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
L226877	u5436	m362	JIM	Right.
L226876	u5442	m362	SUZY	I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
L226875	u5436	m362	JIM	Right.
L226860	u5436	m362	JIM	There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
L226859	u5442	m362	SUZY	Tell me.
L226858	u5436	m362	JIM	Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
L226857	u5442	m362	SUZY	What murders?
L226854	u5436	m362	JIM	Nothing.
L226853	u5442	m362	SUZY	What's wrong?
L226849	u5442	m362	SUZY	Ask me in about five minutes.
L226848	u5436	m362	JIM	Well...how do you feel?
L227357	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Don't be ridiculous!
L227356	u5441	m362	SEAN	Jason's here in New York.
L227292	u5441	m362	SEAN	We have to get off this ship!!
L227291	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Dear Christ...
L227286	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Not another word, do you hear me??
L227285	u5441	m362	SEAN	This is Jason's fault!
L227284	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
L227246	u5441	m362	SEAN	The fire alarm...
L227245	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	What's that?
L227196	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
L227195	u5441	m362	SEAN	She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
L227194	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Christ...where's Rennie??
L227177	u5441	m362	SEAN	It's...dead.
L227176	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Where's the radio?
L226905	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
L226904	u5441	m362	SEAN	But I thought...
L226903	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Rennie's not coming.
L226902	u5441	m362	SEAN	Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
L227103	u5443	m362	TAMARA	But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
L227102	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
L227101	u5443	m362	TAMARA	I packed it. Just for us.
L227100	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Where did you get that alcohol?
L227053	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
L227052	u5443	m362	TAMARA	They're out of town.
L227051	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
L227048	u5443	m362	TAMARA	Nothing.
L227047	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	What are you doing in here?
L226944	u5443	m362	TAMARA	Perfectly.
L226943	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
L227334	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
L227333	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	I don't think that's such a safe idea
L227332	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
L227317	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
L227316	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	There must be a phone around here somewhere.
L227282	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
L227281	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	What did you do with Rennie??
L227253	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
L227252	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	What are you talking about?
L227251	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I doubt very much that one even exists.
L227242	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
L227241	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	He's doing the best he can, Charles.
L227240	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
L227239	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Did you find Rennie?
L227189	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Walking corpses are not real!
L227188	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
L227187	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
L227186	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	What are you doing??
L227175	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Oh dear God...
L227174	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I demand to know what is going on...
L227136	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Where is she?
L227135	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I thought I told you to stay away from her.
L227092	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
L227091	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
L226958	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	No, I think it's just the beginning.
L226957	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
L226956	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
L226955	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
L226954	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
L226953	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	You have no right...
L226952	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
L226951	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
L226950	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
L226949	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
L226948	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
L227385	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
L227384	u5445	m362	YOUNG RENNIE	I...I can't...
L227382	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Am I? Let's find out.
L227381	u5445	m362	YOUNG RENNIE	You're telling a lie.
L227380	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
L227379	u5445	m362	YOUNG RENNIE	He is not.
L227378	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
L227375	u5445	m362	YOUNG RENNIE	I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
L227374	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
L227373	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
L227372	u5445	m362	YOUNG RENNIE	What a beautiful day.
L227388	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
L227387	u5440	m362	RENNIE	You pushed me...
L227297	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	You can and you will!!
L227296	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I...I can't...
L227295	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Get in the boat, Rennie!
L227228	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	This isn't a request.
L227227	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
L227226	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
L227225	u5440	m362	RENNIE	But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
L227224	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
L227223	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Can't we at least talk about it?
L227217	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
L227216	u5440	m362	RENNIE	But Sean said...
L227215	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	You had me worried to death!
L227002	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I'm staying.
L227001	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
L227000	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
L226999	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	Why are you doing this to yourself?
L226998	u5440	m362	RENNIE	She didn't push me into coming.
L226997	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
L226996	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I'm staying.
L226995	u5437	m362	MCCULLOCH	You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
L227089	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
L227088	u5440	m362	RENNIE	No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
L227087	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Did you have an accident in the lake?
L227086	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	After your parents passed away?
L227085	u5440	m362	RENNIE	About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
L227084	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	When did this start?
L227083	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
L227082	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
L227081	u5440	m362	RENNIE	It's not that simple.
L227080	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
L227079	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	I gathered that.
L227078	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I can't swim.
L227064	u5440	m362	RENNIE	There's something I haven't told you...
L227063	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
L227062	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Yeah...a lot.
L227061	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	So, are you having fun yet?
L227060	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
L227059	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Have you seen my dog anywhere?
L227058	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
L226922	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
L226921	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I don't know what to say...
L226920	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
L226917	u5440	m362	RENNIE	That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
L226916	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
L226915	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Really?
L226914	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
L226913	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Just felt a little chill.
L226912	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	Everything okay?
L226911	u5440	m362	RENNIE	What about not-so-great writers?
L226910	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
L226909	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
L226908	u5438	m362	MISS VAN DEUSEN	I'm glad you decided to come after all.
L227172	u5439	m362	RADIO OFFICER	Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
L227171	u5441	m362	SEAN	I've got the numbers.
L227170	u5439	m362	RADIO OFFICER	The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
L227169	u5441	m362	SEAN	Yes...
L227168	u5439	m362	RADIO OFFICER	Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
L227167	u5441	m362	SEAN	I...I don't know...
L227166	u5439	m362	RADIO OFFICER	What is your location?
L227165	u5441	m362	SEAN	The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
L227409	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Please, hurry...
L227408	u5441	m362	SEAN	You have to call the police...
L227349	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
L227348	u5441	m362	SEAN	Rennie...what'd they do to you??
L227275	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I'm not!!
L227274	u5441	m362	SEAN	But Rennie...
L227273	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I'm not going near any lifeboat!
L227272	u5441	m362	SEAN	We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
L227269	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Is the ship going to sink??
L227268	u5441	m362	SEAN	Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
L227263	u5440	m362	RENNIE	The window...
L227262	u5441	m362	SEAN	Rennie...??
L227155	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Just radio for help, okay???
L227154	u5441	m362	SEAN	I didn't mean for you to go!
L227153	u5441	m362	SEAN	The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
L227152	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Where are they?
L227151	u5441	m362	SEAN	I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
L227148	u5440	m362	RENNIE	What do you mean???
L227147	u5441	m362	SEAN	I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
L227130	u5441	m362	SEAN	If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
L227129	u5440	m362	RENNIE	What about you?
L227128	u5441	m362	SEAN	Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
L227127	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Can he really take us home?
L227118	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I want to go home. I want off this ship.
L227117	u5441	m362	SEAN	It's okay...you're going to be okay.
L226991	u5440	m362	RENNIE	I'd love to.
L226990	u5441	m362	SEAN	I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
L226988	u5441	m362	SEAN	Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
L226987	u5440	m362	RENNIE	But I didn't get you one...
L226986	u5441	m362	SEAN	I got you a present.
L226985	u5440	m362	RENNIE	We changed our minds.
L226984	u5441	m362	SEAN	I heard you weren't coming.
L226983	u5440	m362	RENNIE	Hi, Sean.
L226982	u5441	m362	SEAN	Rennie...
L260204	u5717	m378	MAN	All right.
L260203	u5705	m378	ATTENDANT	I'll take you down there.
L260202	u5717	m378	MAN	Real charmer.
L260201	u5705	m378	ATTENDANT	Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
L260200	u5717	m378	MAN	Yeah.  Should be on the road.
L260199	u5705	m378	ATTENDANT	You're late.
L260198	u5717	m378	MAN	A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
L260197	u5705	m378	ATTENDANT	Purpose of visit?
L260727	u5706	m378	BRADY	Go!
L260726	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Brady! Come with us! Brady!
L260725	u5706	m378	BRADY	Get up there Rachel!

L260718	u5706	m378	BRADY	Shit!
L260717	u5706	m378	BRADY	No. You son of a bitch!
L260716	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Brady!
L260715	u5706	m378	BRADY	Get back!
L260714	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Brady!
L260710	u5706	m378	BRADY	We're trapped in this house.
L260709	u5719	m378	RACHEL	What does that mean?
L260708	u5706	m378	BRADY	Its metal, god dammit its metal.
L260706	u5719	m378	RACHEL	I don't know!
L260705	u5706	m378	BRADY	Is there another key?
L260704	u5719	m378	RACHEL	She's not dead!
L260703	u5706	m378	BRADY	You think she stands a chance?
L260702	u5706	m378	BRADY	Look.
L260701	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Not without Jamie.
L260700	u5706	m378	BRADY	No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
L260625	u5719	m378	RACHEL	10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
L260624	u5706	m378	BRADY	Who's that?
L260623	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Michael Myers.
L260622	u5706	m378	BRADY	What's going on?
L260621	u5719	m378	RACHEL	We've been better.
L260620	u5706	m378	BRADY	Are you two okay?
L260499	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
L260498	u5706	m378	BRADY	I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
L260497	u5719	m378	RACHEL	So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
L260496	u5706	m378	BRADY	I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
L260495	u5706	m378	BRADY	No, you don't understand.
L260494	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
L260491	u5719	m378	RACHEL	You don't owe me anything.
L260490	u5706	m378	BRADY	Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
L260397	u5706	m378	BRADY	Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
L260396	u5719	m378	RACHEL	I don't know Brady.
L260395	u5706	m378	BRADY	So?
L260394	u5719	m378	RACHEL	My parents are going to come home early tonight.
L260393	u5706	m378	BRADY	Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
L260392	u5706	m378	BRADY	I'm not angry it's just
L260391	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Don't get angry.
L260390	u5706	m378	BRADY	Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
L260389	u5719	m378	RACHEL	This morning.
L260388	u5706	m378	BRADY	When did you find this out?
L260387	u5719	m378	RACHEL	So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
L260386	u5706	m378	BRADY	So?
L260385	u5719	m378	RACHEL	My parents baby-sitter canceled.
L260384	u5706	m378	BRADY	What?
L260382	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Its about tonight.
L260381	u5706	m378	BRADY	Okay sure. What about?
L260380	u5719	m378	RACHEL	We need to talk.
L260377	u5706	m378	BRADY	You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
L260376	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
L260375	u5706	m378	BRADY	Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
L260318	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
L260317	u5707	m378	COP	I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
L260313	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
L260312	u5707	m378	COP	It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
L260306	u5707	m378	COP	Yes, sir.
L260305	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	An accident?
L260304	u5707	m378	COP	Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
L260303	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	When did this happen?
L260426	u5719	m378	RACHEL	I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
L260425	u5708	m378	DARLENE	We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
L260424	u5719	m378	RACHEL	You guys always look great.
L260423	u5708	m378	DARLENE	How do we look?
L260277	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
L260276	u5719	m378	RACHEL	What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
L260275	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Its too late.
L260274	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Can't you find somebody else?
L260273	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
L260272	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
L260271	u5708	m378	DARLENE	You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
L260270	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Mom, please
L260265	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
L260264	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
L260582	u5720	m378	RICHARD	I'm not calling the fire department.
L260581	u5708	m378	DARLENE	We should call the fire department.
L260580	u5720	m378	RICHARD	I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
L260579	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Because the lights are all out.
L260578	u5720	m378	RICHARD	How do you know their not?
L260577	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Honey, I don't think their home.
L260269	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
L260268	u5720	m378	RICHARD	Why not?
L260267	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
L260266	u5720	m378	RICHARD	Found it.
L260263	u5720	m378	RICHARD	Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
L260262	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
L260258	u5720	m378	RICHARD	It's okay..it's okay.
L260257	u5708	m378	DARLENE	Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
L260321	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
L260320	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Now where are you going?
L260311	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	How many bodies did you find?
L260310	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Four plus Myers.
L260309	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	How many people in the bus?
L260308	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Why shouldn't I?
L260297	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
L260296	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
L260295	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	I can see this is useless.
L260294	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
L260293	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
L260292	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
L260291	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	About what?
L260290	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Why wasn't I notified?
L260229	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Drive Carefully.
L260228	u5717	m378	MAN	Night Doc.
L260227	u5717	m378	MAN	Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
L260226	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
L260225	u5717	m378	MAN	Watch it.
L260223	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
L260222	u5717	m378	MAN	I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
L260221	u5717	m378	MAN	Check him out.
L260220	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Outside.
L260219	u5717	m378	MAN	I do.
L260218	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
L260217	u5717	m378	MAN	Has he been prepped?
L260216	u5709	m378	DR. HOFFMAN	I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
L260215	u5717	m378	MAN	Yes.
L260780	u5710	m378	EARL	Okay, out.
L260779	u5711	m378	GUY	Got it Earl.
L260778	u5710	m378	EARL	Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
L260585	u5710	m378	EARL	You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
L260584	u5711	m378	GUY	Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
L260567	u5711	m378	GUY	Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
L260566	u5710	m378	EARL	Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
L260562	u5710	m378	EARL	Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
L260561	u5711	m378	GUY	What the hell did this?
L260519	u5711	m378	GUY	No way. No how.
L260518	u5710	m378	EARL	We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
L260511	u5710	m378	EARL	Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
L260510	u5711	m378	GUY	Who you calling?
L260509	u5710	m378	EARL	Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
L260508	u5711	m378	GUY	Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
L260749	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Rachel!

L260401	u5712	m378	JAMIE	He's coming to get me Rachel.
L260400	u5719	m378	RACHEL	What?
L260399	u5712	m378	JAMIE	It was the nightmare man
L260398	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Jamie, what happened?
L260379	u5719	m378	RACHEL	In a second.
L260378	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Come on Rachel.
L260362	u5719	m378	RACHEL	You bet.
L260361	u5712	m378	JAMIE	The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
L260348	u5719	m378	RACHEL	But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
L260347	u5712	m378	JAMIE	I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
L260346	u5719	m378	RACHEL	You ready for some Ice Cream?
L260345	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Hi.
L260289	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
L260288	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Double scoops?
L260287	u5719	m378	RACHEL	How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
L260286	u5719	m378	RACHEL	It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
L260285	u5712	m378	JAMIE	I don't want to.
L260284	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
L260283	u5712	m378	JAMIE	But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
L260282	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
L260279	u5712	m378	JAMIE	I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
L260278	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
L260251	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
L260250	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
L260249	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
L260248	u5712	m378	JAMIE	It's been eleven months.
L260247	u5719	m378	RACHEL	I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
L260246	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Sure it does.
L260245	u5719	m378	RACHEL	We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
L260244	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Like a real sister?
L260243	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Jamie, sometimes it's...
L260242	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Like a sister?
L260241	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
L260240	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Do you love me Rachel?
L260239	u5719	m378	RACHEL	What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
L260238	u5712	m378	JAMIE	I can't sleep.
L260237	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Kido. It's four in the morning.
L260763	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	No.
L260762	u5712	m378	JAMIE	You don't believe that do you?
L260761	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Yeah.
L260760	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Then we'll be safe?
L260759	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	We'll hear sirens soon.
L260756	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
L260755	u5712	m378	JAMIE	Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
L260754	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	What are you doing out here alone?
L260633	u5713	m378	KELLY	All right.
L260632	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Why don't you go make some coffee.
L260629	u5718	m378	MEEKER	All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
L260628	u5713	m378	KELLY	That's all the windows, Dad.
L260600	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Just do it.
L260599	u5713	m378	KELLY	Why?
L260598	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
L260597	u5713	m378	KELLY	Dad, what's going on?
L260596	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
L260669	u5713	m378	KELLY	Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
L260668	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Don't you mean what you do best?
L260667	u5713	m378	KELLY	He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
L260666	u5719	m378	RACHEL	You knew. You just didn't care.
L260665	u5713	m378	KELLY	I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
L260486	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Hi.
L260485	u5713	m378	KELLY	Hi Rachel.
L260374	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	Okay, bye.
L260373	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Call me.
L260360	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Jamie?
L260359	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
L260358	u5719	m378	RACHEL	I don't know.
L260357	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
L260356	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
L260355	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	You won't come on too strong.
L260354	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
L260353	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	You won't look pushy.
L260352	u5719	m378	RACHEL	I don't want to look pushy.
L260351	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
L260350	u5719	m378	RACHEL	No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
L260349	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
L260344	u5714	m378	LINDSAY	Hi Jamie.
L260343	u5719	m378	RACHEL	You remember Lindsay don't you?
L260663	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
L260662	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Do you?
L260661	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	The state police won't know how to stop him.
L260660	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Leave Myers for the state boys.
L260659	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
L260658	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Where are you going?
L260657	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Its not over yet.
L260656	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Hell of a night.
L260683	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
L260682	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
L260681	u5718	m378	MEEKER	I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
L260631	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Got it Ben.
L260630	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
L260619	u5718	m378	MEEKER	If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
L260618	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Isn't this all a little paranoid?
L260617	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Making sure that no one can get in here.
L260616	u5715	m378	LOGAN	What are we doing?
L260615	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Get the outside shutters.
L260609	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Go get it.
L260608	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
L260607	u5718	m378	MEEKER	You got your riot gun?
L260576	u5715	m378	LOGAN	I'll be there in 5 minutes.
L260575	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
L260574	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
L260573	u5718	m378	MEEKER	This is 132, over.
L260572	u5715	m378	LOGAN	132 to 133 this is 134.
L260529	u5715	m378	LOGAN	No problem, Sheriff.
L260528	u5718	m378	MEEKER	You look sharp. You understand?
L260527	u5715	m378	LOGAN	Right here, Ben.
L260526	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
L260800	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
L260799	u5718	m378	MEEKER	These kids aren't likely to forget.
L260798	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
L260797	u5718	m378	MEEKER	It's over.
L260639	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
L260638	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	How's it powered?
L260602	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
L260601	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Where's the radio?
L260595	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Be here in a minute.
L260594	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Where's that Deputy?
L260570	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
L260569	u5718	m378	MEEKER	You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
L260565	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
L260564	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
L260558	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Evil.
L260557	u5718	m378	MEEKER	What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
L260556	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	It isn't a man.
L260555	u5718	m378	MEEKER	How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
L260554	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	They didn't know what they were fighting.
L260553	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
L260548	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Dear God.
L260547	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Oh Christ. Doc...
L260546	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Yes.
L260545	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Is that him? Is that him?
L260525	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Least I'm not alone.
L260524	u5718	m378	MEEKER	This is starting to spook me.
L260523	u5718	m378	MEEKER	How do you know?
L260522	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	He's been here.
L260521	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Something?
L260467	u5718	m378	MEEKER	All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
L260466	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	When he makes that call.
L260463	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
L260462	u5718	m378	MEEKER	All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
L260461	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Its true, Sheriff.
L260460	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
L260459	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
L260458	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
L260457	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
L260456	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
L260455	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
L260454	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Why?
L260453	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	He's here, Sheriff.
L260452	u5718	m378	MEEKER	That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
L260451	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
L260450	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
L260449	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
L260448	u5718	m378	MEEKER	I am. Ben Meeker.
L260418	u5721	m378	SAYER	Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
L260417	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	I know that Mr. Sayer.
L260416	u5721	m378	SAYER	Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
L260415	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
L260414	u5721	m378	SAYER	Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
L260413	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Sort of.
L260412	u5721	m378	SAYER	Car trouble?
L260411	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Loomis. Haddonfield.
L260410	u5721	m378	SAYER	Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
L260409	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
L260408	u5721	m378	SAYER	Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
L260407	u5716	m378	LOOMIS	Thank you.
L260794	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Don't touch him Jamie!
L260793	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Jamie! Get away!
L260791	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
L260790	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
L260680	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Uh huh.
L260679	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Now you understand?
L260678	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Okay.
L260677	u5718	m378	MEEKER	All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
L260676	u5719	m378	RACHEL	Sheriff, what is going on out there?
L260543	u5719	m378	RACHEL	What's going on?
L260542	u5718	m378	MEEKER	Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!

L259910	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Huh?
L259909	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
L259907	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
L259906	u5722	m379	ANNIE	You blame everything on kids.
L259905	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
L259904	u5722	m379	ANNIE	What happened?
L259903	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	What?
L259902	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Hi, Dad. What happened?
L259901	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Hi, Annie, Laurie...
L259832	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Fun-ny. See you.
L259831	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Saving the treats for Bob?
L259830	u5729	m379	LYNDA	I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
L259829	u5722	m379	ANNIE	What time?
L259826	u5722	m379	ANNIE	All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
L259825	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
L259824	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
L259823	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Well, are we still on for tonight?
L259809	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
L259808	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Sure.
L259807	u5722	m379	ANNIE	We just talked.
L259806	u5729	m379	LYNDA	It's been totally charted.
L259802	u5722	m379	ANNIE	That's not true. Here I am.
L259801	u5729	m379	LYNDA	We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
L259800	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Why didn't you wait for me?
L260045	u5722	m379	ANNIE	He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
L260044	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
L260043	u5722	m379	ANNIE	If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
L260042	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Wait a minute here...
L260041	u5722	m379	ANNIE	He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
L260040	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Yes, you can.
L260039	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I can't.
L260038	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
L260037	u5722	m379	ANNIE	This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
L260036	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Fancy.
L259970	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Annie!
L259969	u5722	m379	ANNIE	You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
L259966	u5722	m379	ANNIE	You guys will make a fabulous couple.
L259965	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
L259964	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
L259963	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I'd say you must have the wrong number.
L259962	u5722	m379	ANNIE	What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
L259961	u5726	m379	LAURIE	What's this big, big news?
L259960	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
L259899	u5722	m379	ANNIE	For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
L259898	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Thanks.
L259897	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
L259896	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
L259895	u5722	m379	ANNIE	What's the pumpkin for?
L259894	u5722	m379	ANNIE	That's probably all he can do.
L259893	u5726	m379	LAURIE	He can still watch.
L259892	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
L259891	u5726	m379	LAURIE	He was watching me.
L259890	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Probably Mister Riddle.
L259889	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
L259888	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Lies.
L259887	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I wasn't spooked.
L259886	u5722	m379	ANNIE	You still spooked?
L259872	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Bye.
L259871	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Sure, see you later.
L259870	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
L259869	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I've already lost it.
L259868	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
L259867	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I thought it was an obscene phone call.
L259866	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
L259865	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
L259864	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Of course.
L259863	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Annie, was that you?
L259862	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Why did you hang up on me?
L259861	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Hello?
L259848	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Okay. Bye.
L259847	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
L259845	u5726	m379	LAURIE	The guys think I'm too smart.
L259844	u5722	m379	ANNIE	It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
L259843	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Cute.
L259842	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
L259841	u5726	m379	LAURIE	He was standing right here.
L259838	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
L259837	u5726	m379	LAURIE	That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
L259836	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I don't see anything.
L259835	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Behind that bush there.
L259834	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Look where?
L259833	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Look.
L259828	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
L259827	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
L259814	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I forgot my chemistry book.
L259813	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I have a place for that.
L259812	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Shit!
L259805	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Exploring uncharted territory?
L259804	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
L259803	u5726	m379	LAURIE	What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
L260033	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Come with me.
L260032	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	Yes.
L260030	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	I want to stay here and watch this.
L260029	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
L260028	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	I don't want to.
L260027	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
L260026	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	I don't know.
L260025	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
L260024	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	I'm scared.
L260019	u5722	m379	ANNIE	I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
L260018	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	You locked yourself in.
L260017	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
L260016	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	Annie, Paul's on the phone!
L259977	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	No, he's not.
L259976	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
L259959	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	Here, Lester.
L259958	u5722	m379	ANNIE	Get him out of here!
L260125	u5729	m379	LYNDA	YEAH?
L260124	u5723	m379	BOB	I thought you were gonna get one for me.
L260123	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Go get me a beer.
L260122	u5723	m379	BOB	Yeah.
L260121	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Is that all you say?
L260120	u5723	m379	BOB	Yeah.
L260119	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Want a beer?
L260118	u5723	m379	BOB	Yeah.
L260117	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Fantastic. Totally.
L260115	u5729	m379	LYNDA	I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
L260114	u5723	m379	BOB	Just answer the damn phone.
L260113	u5729	m379	LYNDA	That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
L260112	u5729	m379	LYNDA	And I can't keep you interested?
L260111	u5723	m379	BOB	I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
L260090	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
L260089	u5723	m379	BOB	I wonder where they went.
L260086	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Totally...
L260085	u5723	m379	BOB	...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
L260084	u5729	m379	LYNDA	You idiot!
L260083	u5723	m379	BOB	Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
L260082	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
L259705	u5724	m379	BOYFRIEND	Yeah.
L259704	u5732	m379	SISTER	Promise?
L259703	u5724	m379	BOYFRIEND	Yeah, sure.
L259702	u5732	m379	SISTER	Will you call me tomorrow?
L259701	u5724	m379	BOYFRIEND	I gotta go.
L259699	u5732	m379	SISTER	Michael's around someplace...
L259698	u5724	m379	BOYFRIEND	We're all alone, aren't we?
L259697	u5724	m379	BOYFRIEND	Are you sure?
L259696	u5732	m379	SISTER	My parents won't be back till ten.
L260174	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
L260173	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Where?
L260172	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I found the car! He's here!
L260171	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
L260081	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
L260080	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	They could be.
L260079	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
L260078	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
L260077	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
L260076	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Exactly what do you need?
L260075	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
L260074	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	You have the wrong feeling.
L260073	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
L260072	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Sure...
L260071	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	You all right?
L260070	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Jesus!
L259944	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	I'll check back in an hour.
L259943	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
L259942	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
L259941	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
L259940	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	What do we do?
L259939	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
L259938	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
L259937	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
L259932	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	He isn't a man.
L259931	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	A man wouldn't do that...
L259930	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Could have...
L259929	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
L259924	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	They may be right.
L259923	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
L259922	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Anybody live here?
L259921	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I'll be here.
L259920	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Ten minutes.
L259919	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	It's important.
L259918	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
L259917	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
L259916	u5725	m379	BRACKETT	Lee Brackett.
L259915	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
L260106	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Have a good time.
L260105	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Okay. Later.
L260104	u5726	m379	LAURIE	They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
L260103	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Well, she's totally not here.
L260102	u5726	m379	LAURIE	No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
L260101	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Is Annie around?
L260100	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
L260099	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Hi, Laurie, what's up?
L259821	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Totally.
L259820	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
L259817	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I don't think so...
L259816	u5729	m379	LYNDA	Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
L259811	u5729	m379	LYNDA	The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
L259810	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I thought you were babysitting tonight.
L259798	u5729	m379	LYNDA	It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
L259797	u5726	m379	LAURIE	As usual, I don't have anything to do.
L259796	u5729	m379	LYNDA	TOTALLY!
L259795	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
L259794	u5729	m379	LYNDA	It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
L260191	u5726	m379	LAURIE	No! Do as I say.
L260190	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Laurie, you come with us...
L260184	u5733	m379	TOMMY	But you can't kill the bogyman.
L260183	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I killed him...
L260182	u5733	m379	TOMMY	How?
L260181	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Yes.
L260180	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Are you sure?
L260177	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Was it the bogyman?
L260176	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
L260169	u5726	m379	LAURIE	HURRY!
L260168	u5733	m379	TOMMY	It's the bogyman, isn't it?
L260167	u5726	m379	LAURIE	DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
L260166	u5733	m379	TOMMY	I'm scared...
L260165	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
L260164	u5733	m379	TOMMY	What is it, Laurie?
L260163	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
L260162	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Tommy, let me in!
L260161	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Who is it?
L260059	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
L260058	u5733	m379	TOMMY	I saw him...
L260057	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
L259999	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
L259998	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I promise.
L259997	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Promise?
L259996	u5726	m379	LAURIE	And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
L259995	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Right.
L259994	u5726	m379	LAURIE	We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
L259993	u5733	m379	TOMMY	The bogyman!
L259992	u5726	m379	LAURIE	What did he look like?
L259991	u5733	m379	TOMMY	There WAS.
L259990	u5726	m379	LAURIE	There was no one outside.
L259989	u5733	m379	TOMMY	I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
L259988	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
L259987	u5733	m379	TOMMY	No...
L259986	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
L259985	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
L259984	u5726	m379	LAURIE	There is no such thing.
L259983	u5733	m379	TOMMY	What about the bogyman?
L259982	u5726	m379	LAURIE	After the Jack-O-Lantern.
L259981	u5733	m379	TOMMY	What about the rest of my comic books?
L259980	u5726	m379	LAURIE	After the movie.
L259979	u5733	m379	TOMMY	What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
L259968	u5726	m379	LAURIE	I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
L259967	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Laurie...
L259952	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
L259951	u5726	m379	LAURIE	'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
L259950	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Mom doesn't like me to have them.
L259949	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Why are they under there?
L259948	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Not any more.
L259947	u5726	m379	LAURIE	But king Arthur was always your favorite.
L259946	u5733	m379	TOMMY	I don't like that story.
L259945	u5726	m379	LAURIE	"...""how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."""
L259760	u5726	m379	LAURIE	See you.
L259759	u5733	m379	TOMMY	I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
L259758	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
L259757	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
L259756	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Just watch.
L259755	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
L259754	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Yes, I am.
L259752	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Sure. Sure.
L259751	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
L259750	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Sure.
L259749	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Can we watch the monster movies?
L259748	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Sure.
L259747	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
L259746	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Same time, same place.
L259745	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Are you coming over tonight?
L259744	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Hi, Tommy.
L259743	u5733	m379	TOMMY	Hey, Laurie...
L260189	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
L260188	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	You're coming with us...
L260187	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
L260179	u5726	m379	LAURIE	There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
L260178	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	I'm scared!
L260097	u5726	m379	LAURIE	You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
L260096	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	Let's make more popcorn.
L260095	u5726	m379	LAURIE	Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
L260015	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	Okay.
L260014	u5731	m379	PAUL	Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
L260013	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	She's washing her clothes.
L260012	u5731	m379	PAUL	Will you get her for me?
L260011	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	Yes, she is.
L260010	u5731	m379	PAUL	Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
L260009	u5727	m379	LINDSEY	Hello.
L259774	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
L259773	u5734	m379	WYNN	Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
L259772	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I'm wasting time.
L259771	u5734	m379	WYNN	PROBABLY going.
L259770	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
L259769	u5734	m379	WYNN	There's nothing else I can do.
L259768	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
L259767	u5734	m379	WYNN	He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
L259766	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
L259765	u5734	m379	WYNN	I've given them his profile.
L259764	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Of course not.
L259763	u5734	m379	WYNN	I'm not responsible, Sam.
L259735	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	"He said something else. ""It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."""
L259734	u5730	m379	MARION	I don't think this is any time to be funny...
L259733	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
L259732	u5730	m379	MARION	What did he say?
L259731	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Move it!
L259730	u5730	m379	MARION	Shouldn't we pick him up?
L259729	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Pull up to the entrance!
L259727	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
L259726	u5730	m379	MARION	The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
L259725	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I couldn't if I tried.
L259724	u5730	m379	MARION	You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
L259723	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	It means... I see.
L259722	u5730	m379	MARION	What does that mean?
L259721	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	I see.
L259720	u5730	m379	MARION	Only minimum security.
L259719	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Ever done anything like this before?
L259718	u5730	m379	MARION	Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
L259717	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	If you say so.
L259716	u5730	m379	MARION	I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
L259715	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
L259714	u5730	m379	MARION	Are there any special instructions?
L259713	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
L259712	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	That's the idea. Here we are.
L259711	u5730	m379	MARION	He'll barely be able to sit up.
L259710	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	Thorazin.
L259709	u5730	m379	MARION	What did you use before?
L259708	u5728	m379	LOOMIS	...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
L276401	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
L276400	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
L276399	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
L276301	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Just get better okay?
L276300	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
L276299	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
L276298	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I understand... I won't-
L276297	u5806	m385	ALLISON	If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
L276296	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Sorry.
L276293	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What was it?
L276292	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
L276291	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
L276290	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No.
L276289	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Did I ever talk about the accident?
L276288	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
L276287	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Well?
L276286	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Sure plenty of times.
L276284	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
L276283	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
L276282	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
L276281	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
L276280	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I did more then that.
L276279	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
L276278	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
L276277	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I understand, I think. Other women?
L276276	u5820	m385	TREVOR	We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
L276274	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You just made that up.
L276273	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Pitbull attacks.
L276272	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Eighty third most common.
L276271	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Skin cancer.
L276270	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Second most common?
L276269	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
L276268	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
L276267	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
L276266	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Okay so... what's the safest place?
L276265	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
L276264	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Bull...
L276263	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It's inside a moving car.
L276262	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I'm stumped.
L276261	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hint. It's not a geographical location.
L276259	u5806	m385	ALLISON	All finished.
L276258	u5820	m385	TREVOR	So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
L276257	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
L276256	u5820	m385	TREVOR	The way you just looked at me...
L276255	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Of course, yes.
L276253	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
L276252	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
L276249	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I'm all over it.
L276248	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
L276247	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
L276202	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I miss her. I miss my wife.
L276201	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
L276200	u5820	m385	TREVOR	If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
L276199	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
L276198	u5820	m385	TREVOR	These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
L276105	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
L276104	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
L276103	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
L276102	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
L276098	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
L276097	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Your insight is enlightening.
L276096	u5806	m385	ALLISON	That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
L276095	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
L276094	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
L276092	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
L276091	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's happening to me? What are you doing?
L275995	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Your wife...?
L275994	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
L275993	u5806	m385	ALLISON	It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
L275992	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
L275991	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
L275990	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Are you a dream too?
L276430	u5807	m385	BRET	I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
L276429	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
L276428	u5807	m385	BRET	We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
L276427	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Bret. What the hell is going on?
L276426	u5807	m385	BRET	Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
L276425	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Bret... what the fuck...?
L276332	u5807	m385	BRET	Someone special.
L276331	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Yeah? You and who else?
L276330	u5807	m385	BRET	Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
L276329	u5820	m385	TREVOR	So you're just packing it up just like that?
L276327	u5807	m385	BRET	As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
L276326	u5820	m385	TREVOR	How much time off?
L276325	u5807	m385	BRET	I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
L276324	u5807	m385	BRET	I quit. Today's my last day.
L276323	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's the occasion?
L276322	u5807	m385	BRET	Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
L276124	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
L276123	u5807	m385	BRET	You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
L276122	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
L276121	u5807	m385	BRET	GWEN?
L276120	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Gwen.
L276119	u5807	m385	BRET	Really? Do tell.
L276118	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I have my connections
L276117	u5807	m385	BRET	Yeah, how's that?
L276116	u5820	m385	TREVOR	The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
L276112	u5807	m385	BRET	Getting paid for doing shit.
L276111	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276110	u5807	m385	BRET	Must be nice.
L276007	u5807	m385	BRET	Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
L276006	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Since what?
L276005	u5807	m385	BRET	Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
L276004	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
L276003	u5807	m385	BRET	Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
L276002	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
L276001	u5807	m385	BRET	Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
L276386	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison Dormere. Your intern.
L276385	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Who's Allison?
L276384	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where's Allison?
L276383	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
L276381	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
L276380	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I've been in here before.
L276379	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Have we met?
L276378	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Ambrose. I know.
L276377	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Hello I'm Dr...
L276451	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's that?
L276450	u5809	m385	GIVENS	Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
L276162	u5809	m385	GIVENS	How many zeros was your wife worth?
L276161	u5820	m385	TREVOR	As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
L276160	u5809	m385	GIVENS	Zero's a number right?
L276159	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You could say that.
L276158	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
L276157	u5809	m385	GIVENS	Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
L276156	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's the difference?
L276155	u5809	m385	GIVENS	No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
L276154	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I said she's been missing for-
L276153	u5809	m385	GIVENS	What did you just say?
L276082	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
L276081	u5810	m385	GWEN	Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
L276080	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276079	u5810	m385	GWEN	Good boy.  Where's is it?
L276025	u5810	m385	GWEN	No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
L276024	u5820	m385	TREVOR	That was cold...
L276023	u5810	m385	GWEN	Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
L276022	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Gwen, my wife's dead.
L276021	u5810	m385	GWEN	YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
L276020	u5810	m385	GWEN	And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
L276019	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
L276018	u5810	m385	GWEN	What's wrong, Trev?
L276017	u5810	m385	GWEN	How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
L276016	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
L276015	u5810	m385	GWEN	Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
L276013	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
L276012	u5810	m385	GWEN	Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
L276361	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It's perfect.
L276360	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
L276359	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
L276358	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You're alive...
L276357	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
L276356	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Kirsty... Kirsty?
L276073	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
L276072	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
L276070	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	I only married you for your body.
L276069	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Really, why's that?
L276068	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
L276067	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
L276066	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
L276065	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Really? Why?
L276064	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Never to put you in my will.
L276063	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276062	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
L276061	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
L276060	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
L276059	u5820	m385	TREVOR	In a word? Lucrative.
L276058	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
L275979	u5820	m385	TREVOR	This isn't happening.
L275978	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
L275976	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
L275975	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L275974	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Oh my God. It's coming out.
L275970	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
L275969	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
L275968	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	You've been cheating on me haven't you?
L275967	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
L275965	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
L275964	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
L275961	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
L275960	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But... I thought...
L275959	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	You win! Okay pull over.
L275958	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Eighty four.
L275957	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Uh... eighty two?
L275956	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
L275955	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
L275954	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
L276456	u5812	m385	LANGE	That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
L276455	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Morgue...?
L276319	u5812	m385	LANGE	We're all here for you Trevor.
L276318	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Thanks.
L276317	u5812	m385	LANGE	The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
L276316	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276315	u5812	m385	LANGE	Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
L276312	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where is she? Where is my wife?
L276311	u5812	m385	LANGE	You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
L276310	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
L276309	u5812	m385	LANGE	I thought you loved games.
L276307	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No please make yourself at home.
L276306	u5812	m385	LANGE	Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
L276037	u5812	m385	LANGE	I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
L276036	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
L276035	u5812	m385	LANGE	For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
L276034	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What evidence?
L276033	u5812	m385	LANGE	Okay then. Here's the scoop.
L276032	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where's my wife?
L276031	u5812	m385	LANGE	Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
L276243	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
L276242	u5813	m385	LARRY	Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
L276241	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
L276240	u5813	m385	LARRY	Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
L276239	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
L276238	u5813	m385	LARRY	Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
L276237	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
L276233	u5820	m385	TREVOR	How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
L276232	u5813	m385	LARRY	And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
L276231	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
L276230	u5813	m385	LARRY	Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
L276229	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
L276228	u5813	m385	LARRY	A little? Try unbelievably.
L276227	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
L276406	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Who the hell are you talking to?
L276405	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What do you want?!
L276404	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Hey buddy!
L276403	u5820	m385	TREVOR	... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
L276402	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Hey buddy!
L276396	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Music to my ears.
L276395	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't work here.
L276394	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
L276373	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Wow you are out of it.  
L276372	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
L276371	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Can you follow them?
L276370	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Two.
L276369	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
L276367	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	We're just gonna take some blood here.
L276366	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Ambulance.
L276365	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Do you know where you are?
L276466	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
L276465	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's under that sheet...?
L276461	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
L276460	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
L276459	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
L276423	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
L276422	u5820	m385	TREVOR	This game is over do you hear me?
L276421	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	Poor Trevor.
L276418	u5817	m385	PRIEST	Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
L276417	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
L276416	u5817	m385	PRIEST	All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
L276415	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
L276411	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
L276410	u5817	m385	PRIEST	What things do you think you've done?
L276409	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
L276355	u5818	m385	SAGE	Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
L276354	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Wait... what the hell is this...
L276353	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I surrender...
L276352	u5818	m385	SAGE	Are you ready?
L276351	u5818	m385	SAGE	You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
L276350	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
L276349	u5818	m385	SAGE	It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
L276348	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
L276347	u5818	m385	SAGE	My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
L276346	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
L276345	u5818	m385	SAGE	Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
L276139	u5818	m385	SAGE	You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
L276138	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
L276137	u5818	m385	SAGE	Dreams?
L276210	u5819	m385	TAWNY	WHAT?!
L276209	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
L276208	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
L276207	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
L276206	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
L276194	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Well now there's a compliment.
L276193	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
L276189	u5819	m385	TAWNY	It's getting hot in here.
L276188	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You must have been very proud of yourselves...
L276187	u5819	m385	TAWNY	If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
L276185	u5819	m385	TAWNY	For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
L276184	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
L276182	u5819	m385	TAWNY	God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
L276181	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
L276180	u5819	m385	TAWNY	I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
L276179	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Really?
L276178	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
L276177	u5819	m385	TAWNY	You okay?
L276176	u5819	m385	TAWNY	YOU!
L276175	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
L276174	u5819	m385	TAWNY	You.
L276173	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
L276172	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Hey. Can I borrow something?
L276056	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
L276055	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It's not that kind of date.
L276054	u5819	m385	TAWNY	The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
L276053	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Last week...
L276052	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What do you mean?
L276051	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
L276050	u5820	m385	TREVOR	-Tawny.
L276049	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
L276048	u5819	m385	TAWNY	... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
L291527	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
L291526	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	And how the hell are we going to do that?
L291525	u5919	m391	EVELYN	But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
L291524	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
L291523	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
L291522	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
L291521	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- the whole thing is falling apart!
L291520	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	-- bullshit --
L291519	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
L291518	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
L291517	u5919	m391	EVELYN	So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
L291516	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Not yet.
L291515	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
L291514	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	It's complicated. But don't worry --
L291513	u5919	m391	EVELYN	So what stopped her?
L291512	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	"-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your ""demise."""
L291511	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
L291510	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw... well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
L291509	u5919	m391	EVELYN	"-- ""oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"""
L291508	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
L291507	u5919	m391	EVELYN	And what's Steven's status?
L291506	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
L291505	u5919	m391	EVELYN	You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
L291504	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
L291203	u5919	m391	EVELYN	No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
L291202	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'm confused.
L291201	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
L291200	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
L291199	u5919	m391	EVELYN	"We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't ""believe"" in divorce."
L291145	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
L291144	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
L291316	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
L291315	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Oh dear.
L291314	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Jesus H. Christ!
L291123	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	"It was on my Dad's list of ""things to do."" But the House did him first."
L291122	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
L291012	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
L291011	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
L291010	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
L291008	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'm moved beyond words.
L291007	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	"Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it ""inspirational."" From some German cathedral a million years ago: ""Driving the Demons From the Mind."""
L291006	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Not at all!
L291005	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
L290979	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
L290978	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
L291464	u5925	m391	SARA	C'mon.
L291463	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Don't think it'll be a problem.
L291460	u5925	m391	SARA	"-- the ""Saturation Chamber."" Where he wanted to put me."
L291459	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
L291353	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
L291352	u5925	m391	SARA	More the merrier.
L291302	u5925	m391	SARA	Yeah...something.
L291301	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
L291127	u5925	m391	SARA	-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
L291126	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Oh, for chrissake --
L291003	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	More to the point. Where's our host?
L291002	u5925	m391	SARA	Looks like we're it.
L291446	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
L291445	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
L291438	u5923	m391	PRICE	Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
L291437	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Oh, really: who?
L291418	u5923	m391	PRICE	Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
L291417	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	-- what was he doing here?
L291416	u5923	m391	PRICE	Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
L291396	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
L291395	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'm sorry --
L291380	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I don't know!!
L291379	u5923	m391	PRICE	Where is it??
L291344	u5923	m391	PRICE	Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
L291343	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
L291342	u5923	m391	PRICE	Excuse me?
L291341	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Three times, to be exact.
L291340	u5923	m391	PRICE	Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
L291299	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Is she alright?
L291298	u5923	m391	PRICE	What?
L291296	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Ms. Marr!
L291295	u5923	m391	PRICE	Melissa!
L291286	u5923	m391	PRICE	Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
L291285	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	There must be some other way out.
L291093	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- I'm sure you did.
L291092	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
L291091	u5923	m391	PRICE	You're not my list.
L291083	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
L291082	u5923	m391	PRICE	Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
L291076	u5923	m391	PRICE	A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
L291075	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	What are you playing here, Price?
L291467	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
L291466	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
L291465	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
L291427	u5918	m391	EDDIE	And I think that's case --
L291426	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	-- I did: down here.
L291351	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Yeah, me too.
L291350	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
L291323	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- fuck you!
L291322	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
L291110	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If this is someone's idea of a joke --
L291109	u5918	m391	EDDIE	This thing's going nowhere.
L290989	u5918	m391	EDDIE	As a tumor.
L290988	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
L291649	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Over here!
L291648	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Pritchett!
L291645	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Up here --
L291644	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Pritchett, is that you?
L291615	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Me? You've gotta be kidding.
L291614	u5918	m391	EDDIE	If you know where it is, get there!
L291609	u5918	m391	EDDIE	It's not going to let us out!
L291608	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
L291574	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
L291573	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What?
L291572	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Uhhhh...
L291566	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Poor Mr. Price --
L291565	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Oh. Jesus.
L291492	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
L291491	u5918	m391	EDDIE	How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
L291490	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
L291489	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Shit, Pritchett!!!
L291385	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	The...Fourth of July.
L291384	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What's down there?
L291312	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Yes.
L291311	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
L291230	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Left, goddamnit!
L291229	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Hey! Where'd you guys go?
L291228	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Did it work?
L291227	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	"New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to ""normalcy."""
L291222	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
L291221	u5918	m391	EDDIE	So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
L291216	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
L291215	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What is it? What's in there?
L291213	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Nothing.
L291212	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What's in there?
L291140	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
L291139	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
L291138	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
L291137	u5918	m391	EDDIE	So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
L291125	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
L291124	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You said that was an accident.
L290997	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
L290996	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
L290994	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
L290993	u5918	m391	EDDIE	'Less the place really is haunted.
L290983	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
L290982	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
L291429	u5923	m391	PRICE	Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
L291428	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- closed.
L291420	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- yeah, we did that --
L291419	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- the stained glass --
L291399	u5923	m391	PRICE	Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
L291398	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Oh, Jesus....
L291347	u5923	m391	PRICE	Prove it how?
L291346	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Prove it.
L291345	u5923	m391	PRICE	Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
L291280	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Best of a nightmare.
L291279	u5923	m391	PRICE	Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
L291175	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Take the gun.
L291174	u5923	m391	PRICE	I'll meet you down there.
L291078	u5923	m391	PRICE	"Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not ""comfortable"" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying."
L291077	u5918	m391	EDDIE	This is nuts.
L291070	u5923	m391	PRICE	The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
L291069	u5918	m391	EDDIE	And we get this money when?
L291068	u5923	m391	PRICE	Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
L291636	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Jesus!
L291635	u5925	m391	SARA	What?
L291634	u5925	m391	SARA	I don't do groups.
L291633	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
L291632	u5925	m391	SARA	Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
L291631	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You okay?
L291619	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What --
L291618	u5925	m391	SARA	Run.
L291617	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Where did it go?
L291612	u5925	m391	SARA	All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
L291611	u5918	m391	EDDIE	It's succeeding!
L291610	u5925	m391	SARA	No. It's just trying to frighten us.
L291603	u5918	m391	EDDIE	For chrissake give me a hand!
L291602	u5925	m391	SARA	The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
L291600	u5925	m391	SARA	-- was that??
L291599	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What --
L291571	u5925	m391	SARA	We're safe?
L291570	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Don't think it's even an issue.
L291569	u5925	m391	SARA	He's dead...?
L291568	u5918	m391	EDDIE	It's okay, everything's okay now.
L291539	u5925	m391	SARA	He's gotta still be down here.
L291538	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Price!!
L291529	u5925	m391	SARA	It'll have to do.
L291528	u5918	m391	EDDIE	This is the best we're gonna do.
L291495	u5925	m391	SARA	What about that other guy?
L291494	u5918	m391	EDDIE	That's crazy!
L291493	u5925	m391	SARA	Or an on-line computer.
L291487	u5925	m391	SARA	Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
L291486	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Wait a minute... What are you saying?
L291485	u5925	m391	SARA	Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
L291484	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Better living through electricity.
L291483	u5925	m391	SARA	Cheery looking bunch.
L291481	u5925	m391	SARA	Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
L291480	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What are you looking for?
L291477	u5925	m391	SARA	Let's try down here...
L291476	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Good point.
L291475	u5925	m391	SARA	Back where?
L291474	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I think we should have taken a right back there.
L291452	u5925	m391	SARA	-- listen to the man --
L291451	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- you lose either way, Price --
L291415	u5925	m391	SARA	-- where the hell were you?
L291414	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- that's the fact, bud --
L291413	u5925	m391	SARA	I was upstairs with Eddie --
L291378	u5925	m391	SARA	You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
L291377	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
L291376	u5925	m391	SARA	-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
L291375	u5918	m391	EDDIE	No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
L291374	u5925	m391	SARA	It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
L291373	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
L291372	u5925	m391	SARA	We can do it...
L291365	u5925	m391	SARA	No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
L291364	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You hear somebody?
L291321	u5918	m391	EDDIE	And then where are we?
L291320	u5925	m391	SARA	An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
L291319	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
L291318	u5925	m391	SARA	Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
L291317	u5918	m391	EDDIE	How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
L291308	u5925	m391	SARA	No...not air --
L291307	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
L291252	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
L291251	u5925	m391	SARA	There's always exceptions.
L291250	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
L291249	u5925	m391	SARA	Why not?
L291248	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I don't think so...
L291247	u5925	m391	SARA	I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
L291246	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
L291245	u5925	m391	SARA	What? Deep down inside?
L291243	u5925	m391	SARA	You need to get out more.
L291242	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Most fun I've had all day.
L291241	u5925	m391	SARA	Thanks.
L291238	u5925	m391	SARA	This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
L291237	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Why?
L291236	u5925	m391	SARA	Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
L291184	u5925	m391	SARA	Don't push it.
L291183	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I'm better than that.
L291182	u5925	m391	SARA	And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
L291027	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I thought she was dead. For sure.
L291026	u5925	m391	SARA	Is she...alright?
L291090	u5922	m391	MELISSA	How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
L291089	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Then what the hell are we doing here?
L291085	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
L291084	u5922	m391	MELISSA	Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
L291042	u5922	m391	MELISSA	I hope not.
L291041	u5918	m391	EDDIE	So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
L291020	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
L291019	u5922	m391	MELISSA	...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
L291016	u5922	m391	MELISSA	The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
L291015	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You've got your own TV show?
L291014	u5922	m391	MELISSA	"I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack ""Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos"" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em."
L291001	u5922	m391	MELISSA	So where's the party?

L291592	u5923	m391	PRICE	Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
L291591	u5919	m391	EVELYN	No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
L291590	u5923	m391	PRICE	No...
L291588	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
L291587	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- wit...nesses --
L291586	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
L291585	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- what...are...you...going...to --
L291584	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
L291583	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Steven --
L291339	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
L291338	u5923	m391	PRICE	They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
L291337	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Question answered.
L291336	u5923	m391	PRICE	Jesus!
L291334	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
L291333	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
L291332	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
L291331	u5923	m391	PRICE	If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
L291330	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- and who's next on your list?
L291329	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- I pose you the same question --
L291328	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
L291327	u5923	m391	PRICE	Asking the wrong person again.
L291326	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
L291289	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Stalking the wild poltergeist.
L291288	u5923	m391	PRICE	Where is she?
L291287	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
L291177	u5923	m391	PRICE	A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
L291176	u5919	m391	EVELYN	And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
L291171	u5923	m391	PRICE	Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
L291170	u5919	m391	EVELYN	So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
L291163	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
L291162	u5923	m391	PRICE	What are you talking about?
L291152	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- in the act.
L291151	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- the sadistic prick --
L291150	u5923	m391	PRICE	Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
L291149	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Really? Well, let it rip.
L291148	u5923	m391	PRICE	Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
L291147	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
L291146	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
L291066	u5919	m391	EVELYN	My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
L291065	u5923	m391	PRICE	Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
L291064	u5923	m391	PRICE	I know.
L291063	u5919	m391	EVELYN	You're hurting me.
L291062	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- just not always in the sexual sense.
L291061	u5923	m391	PRICE	You know everything you do gets me hot.
L291060	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
L291059	u5923	m391	PRICE	You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
L291058	u5919	m391	EVELYN	All accidents until proven otherwise.
L291057	u5923	m391	PRICE	"Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The ""O.J."" knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your ""Jim Jones Kool- Aid"" that was exactly that?"
L291056	u5919	m391	EVELYN	It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
L291055	u5923	m391	PRICE	Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
L291054	u5919	m391	EVELYN	What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
L291053	u5923	m391	PRICE	You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
L291052	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Then who are they?
L291051	u5923	m391	PRICE	Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
L291050	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
L291049	u5923	m391	PRICE	Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
L291048	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
L291039	u5923	m391	PRICE	Oh, I think we're going to have several.
L291038	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Could we have a word?
L291036	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Haven't they already?
L291035	u5923	m391	PRICE	You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
L291034	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I'm not laughing, Steven.
L291033	u5923	m391	PRICE	I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
L291032	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Don't touch me!
L290945	u5919	m391	EVELYN	"Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: ""Haunted Hill"" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --"
L290944	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
L290971	u5920	m391	JENZEN	Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
L290970	u5925	m391	SARA	...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
L290968	u5920	m391	JENZEN	And here's your goddamn severance!
L290967	u5925	m391	SARA	What?
L290966	u5920	m391	JENZEN	-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
L290965	u5925	m391	SARA	No, no, it's just --
L290964	u5920	m391	JENZEN	You think this is fucking funny??
L290957	u5920	m391	JENZEN	-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
L290956	u5925	m391	SARA	I was in the middle of --
L290955	u5920	m391	JENZEN	You didn't think to ask?
L290954	u5925	m391	SARA	Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
L290953	u5920	m391	JENZEN	Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
L290952	u5925	m391	SARA	I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
L290932	u5923	m391	PRICE	Maybe if I --
L290931	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Please! Something! Oh-God!
L290929	u5923	m391	PRICE	Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
L290928	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Do something!
L290921	u5923	m391	PRICE	I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
L290920	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	First time for everything.
L290916	u5923	m391	PRICE	I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
L290915	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
L290913	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think it's something better experienced then described.
L290912	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	And then what happens?
L290911	u5923	m391	PRICE	Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
L290909	u5923	m391	PRICE	Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
L290908	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	"Your roller coaster that is, quote: ""unlike any that has ever come before it."""
L290907	u5923	m391	PRICE	My wife. Where were we?
L290906	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
L291597	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I am.
L291596	u5923	m391	PRICE	He was right! Pritchett was right!
L291440	u5923	m391	PRICE	Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
L291439	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Vannacutt!!
L291432	u5923	m391	PRICE	Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
L291431	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
L291410	u5923	m391	PRICE	"I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as ""ghosts."" This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --"
L291409	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	House 2, Guests 0.
L291356	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
L291355	u5923	m391	PRICE	What?
L291354	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I think...I may have the answer.
L291136	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
L291135	u5923	m391	PRICE	Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
L291101	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
L291100	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- even if I give you a million as well?
L291099	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- my loss --
L291098	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
L291097	u5923	m391	PRICE	Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
L291096	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
L291080	u5923	m391	PRICE	Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
L291079	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I'm ready now.
L291031	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I can't remember at the moment.
L291030	u5923	m391	PRICE	She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
L291562	u5925	m391	SARA	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
L291561	u5923	m391	PRICE	Please! I need your help.
L291560	u5925	m391	SARA	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
L291559	u5923	m391	PRICE	Then tell me, please -- help me...!
L291454	u5925	m391	SARA	-- no more --
L291453	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- listen to me, goddamnit --
L291450	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
L291449	u5925	m391	SARA	-- confirming everything we already know --
L291448	u5923	m391	PRICE	Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
L291444	u5923	m391	PRICE	Well, I can't, sweetheart.
L291443	u5925	m391	SARA	I'll take my chances.
L291442	u5923	m391	PRICE	"Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the ""Saturation Chamber."""
L291441	u5925	m391	SARA	Well, I don't.
L291436	u5923	m391	PRICE	I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
L291435	u5925	m391	SARA	Fascinated.
L291434	u5923	m391	PRICE	Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
L291433	u5925	m391	SARA	If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
L291425	u5925	m391	SARA	I never saw you --
L291424	u5923	m391	PRICE	I was upstairs!
L291422	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
L291421	u5925	m391	SARA	-- the window and door grates --
L291406	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think I'll do what I damn well please.
L291405	u5925	m391	SARA	I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
L291382	u5923	m391	PRICE	Something with the power, I don't know!!
L291381	u5925	m391	SARA	What is it??
L291211	u5923	m391	PRICE	I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
L291210	u5925	m391	SARA	Good way to get your head blown off.
L291209	u5923	m391	PRICE	Sorry.
L291095	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
L291094	u5925	m391	SARA	This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
L291088	u5923	m391	PRICE	Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
L291087	u5925	m391	SARA	Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
L291074	u5923	m391	PRICE	Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
L291073	u5925	m391	SARA	What're you talking about?
L291072	u5923	m391	PRICE	You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
L291071	u5925	m391	SARA	Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
L291198	u5923	m391	PRICE	Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
L291197	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
L291196	u5923	m391	PRICE	No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
L291195	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
L291194	u5923	m391	PRICE	It works.
L291193	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
L291192	u5923	m391	PRICE	Then who did??
L291191	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
L291190	u5923	m391	PRICE	Rewind that.
L291189	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	-- it wasn't me.
L291188	u5923	m391	PRICE	I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
L291187	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	The lockdown thing.
L291186	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
L290941	u5923	m391	PRICE	So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
L290940	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Dummy 6 keeps losing his arm.
L290939	u5923	m391	PRICE	Problem where? Looked good to me.
L290938	u5923	m391	PRICE	Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
L290937	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Houston, I think we may have a problem.
L291643	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- ten.
L291642	u5925	m391	SARA	-- hey! --
L291606	u5925	m391	SARA	How, he's supposed to be dead!
L291605	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	He must've unsealed the room!
L291604	u5925	m391	SARA	Pritchett: what is going on?
L291544	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Oh, dear.
L291543	u5925	m391	SARA	Price!
L291533	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	He would have been back by now.
L291532	u5925	m391	SARA	Excuse me?
L291531	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Blackburn's dead.
L291530	u5925	m391	SARA	You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
L291284	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
L291283	u5925	m391	SARA	"Pritchett, what is this ""core of darkness""?"
L291282	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
L291281	u5925	m391	SARA	There is something very not normal going on here!
L291220	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
L291219	u5925	m391	SARA	And you think it's in there?
L291218	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
L291217	u5925	m391	SARA	Ghosts killed your father?
L291207	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
L291206	u5925	m391	SARA	You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
L291159	u5925	m391	SARA	Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
L291158	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
L291157	u5925	m391	SARA	No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
L291156	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
L291155	u5925	m391	SARA	"Pritchett, this ""lockdown"" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?"
L291154	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Believe me, we need to.
L291153	u5925	m391	SARA	Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
L291134	u5925	m391	SARA	Why not?
L291133	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Won't do any good.
L291130	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
L291129	u5925	m391	SARA	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
L291128	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Don't know that it does.
L291103	u5925	m391	SARA	What's going on?
L291102	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Oh, no.
L291044	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I can't comment until I get paid.
L291043	u5925	m391	SARA	Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
L290992	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	He must've beaten us all here!
L290991	u5925	m391	SARA	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
L290990	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Wish I could take the credit, but --
L290985	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
L290984	u5925	m391	SARA	But the million bucks each, that's for real?
L291555	u5927	m391	VOICE	-- something horrible...I don't understand --
L291554	u5925	m391	SARA	-- I'm coming --
L291553	u5927	m391	VOICE	Something....happened --
L291552	u5925	m391	SARA	Keep talking, I'll find you!
L291551	u5927	m391	VOICE	Sara...?
L291550	u5925	m391	SARA	Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
L291549	u5927	m391	VOICE	For the love of God....please...?
L291548	u5925	m391	SARA	Melissa...?
L291547	u5927	m391	VOICE	Please.....anyone....help me?
L291273	u5927	m391	VOICE	Over here.
L291272	u5925	m391	SARA	-- Eddie!!
L291999	u5928	m392	AMY	The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
L291998	u5932	m392	SHEA	We don't have proof of that.
L291997	u5928	m392	AMY	It might have been her mother.
L291996	u5932	m392	SHEA	So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
L291955	u5928	m392	AMY	Colleen.
L291954	u5932	m392	SHEA	What was her name?
L291953	u5928	m392	AMY	It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
L291951	u5928	m392	AMY	I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
L291950	u5932	m392	SHEA	Did you find something?
L291949	u5928	m392	AMY	These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
L291948	u5932	m392	SHEA	What's the matter?
L291947	u5928	m392	AMY	Damn it.
L291914	u5928	m392	AMY	You say you saw some activity here?
L291913	u5932	m392	SHEA	I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
L292147	u5933	m392	WILL	Good-bye.
L292146	u5928	m392	AMY	Good-bye.
L292139	u5928	m392	AMY	There's no need to be.
L292138	u5933	m392	WILL	I'm sorry.
L292137	u5928	m392	AMY	It will heal.
L292136	u5933	m392	WILL	How's your arm?
L292135	u5928	m392	AMY	A few years older, perhaps.
L292134	u5933	m392	WILL	Are you all right?
L292048	u5933	m392	WILL	No!
L292047	u5928	m392	AMY	Did you find her?!
L292033	u5933	m392	WILL	Why don't you pass me your plate?
L292032	u5928	m392	AMY	It looks delicious...
L292022	u5928	m392	AMY	Yes.  It was.
L292021	u5933	m392	WILL	Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
L292020	u5928	m392	AMY	So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
L292019	u5933	m392	WILL	I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
L292018	u5928	m392	AMY	There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
L292017	u5933	m392	WILL	How did you meet Dr. Shea?
L292016	u5928	m392	AMY	No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
L292015	u5933	m392	WILL	Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
L292014	u5928	m392	AMY	I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
L291934	u5928	m392	AMY	I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
L291933	u5933	m392	WILL	What will they tell you?
L291932	u5928	m392	AMY	Town records are coming up now.
L291909	u5933	m392	WILL	Suppose not.
L291908	u5928	m392	AMY	They don't build them like this anymore.
L292081	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
L292080	u5928	m392	AMY	What do these ingredients mean?
L292079	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
L292078	u5928	m392	AMY	I don't understand.
L292077	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	By freeing them.
L292076	u5928	m392	AMY	By killing them?
L292075	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
L292074	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
L292073	u5928	m392	AMY	Where does this amulet come from?
L291995	u5928	m392	AMY	That poor little girl.
L291994	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
L292240	u5929	m392	AUBREY	I'm ok mommy.
L292239	u5930	m392	MAURA	Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
L292197	u5929	m392	AUBREY	What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
L292196	u5930	m392	MAURA	Your father doesn't love us anymore!
L292180	u5930	m392	MAURA	Go to your room!  Now!
L292179	u5929	m392	AUBREY	H-how long will it take?
L292175	u5930	m392	MAURA	We'll get it later.
L292174	u5929	m392	AUBREY	What about all my other stuff?
L292173	u5930	m392	MAURA	We're going to go someplace new.
L292172	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Where are we going to go, mommy?
L292143	u5930	m392	MAURA	Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
L292142	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Are we leaving mommy?
L292120	u5929	m392	AUBREY	I'm scared!
L292119	u5930	m392	MAURA	My angel!
L292027	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Ok...
L292026	u5930	m392	MAURA	Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
L291973	u5930	m392	MAURA	She's down...how do you mean honey?
L291972	u5929	m392	AUBREY	She's down...
L291960	u5929	m392	AUBREY	She talks to me.
L291959	u5930	m392	MAURA	Can you talk to her?
L291958	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Yes.
L291957	u5930	m392	MAURA	Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
L291880	u5930	m392	MAURA	No it won't - no it won't!
L291879	u5929	m392	AUBREY	It's going to hurt us!
L291850	u5930	m392	MAURA	Who...is Colleen?
L291849	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Maybe it was Colleen...
L291848	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well then who did?!
L291847	u5929	m392	AUBREY	I didn't do anything, mommy.
L291846	u5930	m392	MAURA	Don't play games with me, little girl.
L291828	u5930	m392	MAURA	We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
L291827	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Can I do it again tonight?
L291826	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well I bet you they're happy.
L291825	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
L291777	u5930	m392	MAURA	Sure.
L291776	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
L292096	u5932	m392	SHEA	My God, I heard something!
L292095	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Help me!  Please!!!
L291976	u5932	m392	SHEA	Take me to her.
L291975	u5929	m392	AUBREY	She's down.  Help her...
L291970	u5929	m392	AUBREY	She's hiding.
L291969	u5932	m392	SHEA	Where is she now?
L291968	u5929	m392	AUBREY	She's here.
L291967	u5932	m392	SHEA	Where is she?
L291966	u5929	m392	AUBREY	She says she's lonely...
L292235	u5933	m392	WILL	Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
L292234	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Mommy!
L292166	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Good night daddy.
L292165	u5933	m392	WILL	Good night Angel...
L292151	u5933	m392	WILL	Well, that all depends.
L292150	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Are we going back to California daddy?
L292114	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Daddy help!
L292113	u5933	m392	WILL	Oh my God!  She's in there!
L292109	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Daddy, please!!!
L292108	u5933	m392	WILL	Don't be afraid!
L292107	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Mommy please help me!
L292103	u5933	m392	WILL	Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
L292102	u5929	m392	AUBREY	I can't move!
L292098	u5929	m392	AUBREY	It's dark!  I can't breathe!
L292097	u5933	m392	WILL	We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
L291816	u5933	m392	WILL	That's great, honey.
L291815	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Look daddy!  It's empty!
L291774	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Did you ever see a leprechaun?
L291773	u5933	m392	WILL	That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
L291772	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
L291759	u5933	m392	WILL	For good luck honey.
L291758	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Why?
L291757	u5933	m392	WILL	He's blessing the house.
L291756	u5929	m392	AUBREY	What's he doing daddy?
L291704	u5933	m392	WILL	Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
L291703	u5929	m392	AUBREY	I want this one, daddy.
L291702	u5933	m392	WILL	Sure.  Did you see the others?
L291701	u5929	m392	AUBREY	Can I have this room daddy?
L292245	u5933	m392	WILL	I'm all right...
L292244	u5930	m392	MAURA	You're bleeding.
L292242	u5930	m392	MAURA	I'm ok.
L292241	u5933	m392	WILL	Are you all right?
L292237	u5930	m392	MAURA	What's happening!
L292236	u5933	m392	WILL	Maura!
L292233	u5933	m392	WILL	No...  NO!
L292232	u5930	m392	MAURA	We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
L292190	u5933	m392	WILL	Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
L292189	u5930	m392	MAURA	We're not going.
L292188	u5933	m392	WILL	Maura, what is this!
L292187	u5933	m392	WILL	What are you talking about?
L292186	u5930	m392	MAURA	Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
L292185	u5933	m392	WILL	What?
L292184	u5930	m392	MAURA	Do you think I'm a fool?
L292183	u5933	m392	WILL	Know what?
L292182	u5930	m392	MAURA	You don't think I know?
L292162	u5933	m392	WILL	No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
L292161	u5930	m392	MAURA	Should I...
L292160	u5933	m392	WILL	You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
L292159	u5933	m392	WILL	Ok...
L292158	u5930	m392	MAURA	I'm fine.
L292155	u5930	m392	MAURA	You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
L292154	u5933	m392	WILL	It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
L292046	u5930	m392	MAURA	Aubrey!
L292045	u5933	m392	WILL	Aubrey!
L292044	u5933	m392	WILL	Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
L292043	u5930	m392	MAURA	She's gone!
L292042	u5930	m392	MAURA	Oh my God where is she!
L292025	u5930	m392	MAURA	Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
L292024	u5933	m392	WILL	I think everything's ready.
L292023	u5930	m392	MAURA	How are we doing?
L291964	u5930	m392	MAURA	You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
L291963	u5933	m392	WILL	A friend?
L291962	u5930	m392	MAURA	She has a...friend.  Colleen.
L291961	u5933	m392	WILL	What are you talking about?
L291923	u5930	m392	MAURA	Are you ok?
L291922	u5933	m392	WILL	Whoa there...
L291890	u5930	m392	MAURA	I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
L291889	u5933	m392	WILL	It just disappeared.  Literally.
L291875	u5933	m392	WILL	I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
L291874	u5930	m392	MAURA	Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
L291873	u5933	m392	WILL	Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
L291872	u5930	m392	MAURA	What about keeping an open mind?
L291871	u5933	m392	WILL	Oh come on!
L291870	u5930	m392	MAURA	I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
L291869	u5933	m392	WILL	Who?
L291868	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
L291867	u5933	m392	WILL	There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
L291866	u5930	m392	MAURA	Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
L291865	u5933	m392	WILL	Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
L291864	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well what do you think it is?
L291863	u5933	m392	WILL	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
L291862	u5930	m392	MAURA	But do you agree with me?
L291861	u5930	m392	MAURA	I don't know what I'm saying.
L291860	u5933	m392	WILL	So what are you saying?
L291859	u5930	m392	MAURA	Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
L291844	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
L291843	u5933	m392	WILL	It was in the cellar.  Weird.
L291842	u5930	m392	MAURA	What is it?
L291840	u5930	m392	MAURA	Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
L291839	u5933	m392	WILL	No.
L291838	u5930	m392	MAURA	Were you fooling with the power?
L291837	u5933	m392	WILL	The heater's here.
L291807	u5930	m392	MAURA	Ok.
L291806	u5933	m392	WILL	...set up some more things.
L291805	u5933	m392	WILL	Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
L291804	u5930	m392	MAURA	She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
L291803	u5933	m392	WILL	No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
L291798	u5933	m392	WILL	I don't know.  That's strange.
L291797	u5930	m392	MAURA	What the hell is that?
L291794	u5930	m392	MAURA	It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
L291793	u5933	m392	WILL	What?
L291792	u5930	m392	MAURA	Are you playing tricks on me?
L291738	u5930	m392	MAURA	I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
L291737	u5933	m392	WILL	God rest her soul.
L291736	u5933	m392	WILL	Or what she was worth.
L291735	u5930	m392	MAURA	Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
L291734	u5933	m392	WILL	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
L291733	u5930	m392	MAURA	I wish I knew more about her.
L291732	u5933	m392	WILL	To our family.
L291731	u5930	m392	MAURA	To our family.
L291726	u5933	m392	WILL	Whatever you say.
L291725	u5930	m392	MAURA	It's just going to take a while.
L291724	u5933	m392	WILL	Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
L291723	u5930	m392	MAURA	You didn't think much about that before.
L291722	u5933	m392	WILL	Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
L291721	u5930	m392	MAURA	Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
L291720	u5933	m392	WILL	What will Aubrey think?
L291719	u5930	m392	MAURA	I just, I don't know...
L291718	u5933	m392	WILL	Oh come on...
L291717	u5930	m392	MAURA	Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
L291716	u5933	m392	WILL	What's the matter?
L291712	u5930	m392	MAURA	Must be...
L291711	u5933	m392	WILL	Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
L291710	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
L291709	u5933	m392	WILL	The place is pretty dusty.
L291708	u5930	m392	MAURA	I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
L291707	u5933	m392	WILL	Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
L291706	u5930	m392	MAURA	Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
L291692	u5933	m392	WILL	Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
L291691	u5930	m392	MAURA	I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
L292037	u5932	m392	SHEA	White meat will be fine...
L292036	u5930	m392	MAURA	Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
L292031	u5930	m392	MAURA	You'll have to settle for turkey.
L292030	u5932	m392	SHEA	I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
L292007	u5930	m392	MAURA	Yeah, they told us this was the best.
L292006	u5932	m392	SHEA	Maura.
L292005	u5930	m392	MAURA	Maura.
L292004	u5932	m392	SHEA	You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
L291944	u5930	m392	MAURA	Before.
L291943	u5932	m392	SHEA	I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
L291931	u5932	m392	SHEA	If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
L291930	u5930	m392	MAURA	Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
L291911	u5930	m392	MAURA	She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
L291910	u5932	m392	SHEA	Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
L291906	u5930	m392	MAURA	What about the other five percent?
L291905	u5932	m392	SHEA	We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
L291904	u5930	m392	MAURA	What do you mean, unfortunately?
L291903	u5932	m392	SHEA	We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
L291902	u5930	m392	MAURA	I think we should do it.
L291894	u5932	m392	SHEA	I could see if I detect the presence of something.
L291893	u5930	m392	MAURA	We don't know.
L291892	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
L291891	u5932	m392	SHEA	Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
L292111	u5930	m392	MAURA	Come back to us honey!
L292110	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	She's coming back.  Keep talking!
L292106	u5930	m392	MAURA	Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
L292105	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Concentrate!  She can hear you!
L292093	u5930	m392	MAURA	Aubrey?  It's mommy.
L292092	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
L292089	u5930	m392	MAURA	So what should we do, father?
L292088	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
L292085	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
L292084	u5930	m392	MAURA	Why?
L292083	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
L292062	u5930	m392	MAURA	What!
L292061	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Your daughter's been taken.
L291770	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
L291769	u5930	m392	MAURA	Well it's nice that you were there for her.
L291766	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
L291765	u5930	m392	MAURA	It was a shame.
L291764	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
L291763	u5930	m392	MAURA	Did you know her very well?
L291762	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
L291754	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	May I come in?
L291753	u5930	m392	MAURA	Oh, that's nice...
L291752	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
L291748	u5930	m392	MAURA	Yes, I am.
L291747	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	You must be a Londrigan.
L292133	u5933	m392	WILL	We'll be there.
L292132	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
L292131	u5933	m392	WILL	Yes, they are.
L292130	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
L292128	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
L292127	u5933	m392	WILL	What's going to happen?
L292126	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	I didn't do anything...God saved her...
L292125	u5933	m392	WILL	I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
L292124	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
L292123	u5933	m392	WILL	The rain is letting up.
L292101	u5933	m392	WILL	It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
L292100	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Keep talking!
L292087	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	It will not take long...
L292086	u5933	m392	WILL	How long will it take!
L292067	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
L292066	u5933	m392	WILL	What are you getting at!
L292065	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
L292064	u5933	m392	WILL	So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
L292063	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
L292058	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Did you remove anything in the cellar!
L292057	u5933	m392	WILL	What...amulet?
L292053	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	The amulet...
L292052	u5933	m392	WILL	This isn't happening...
L292001	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
L292000	u5933	m392	WILL	We'll never know for sure.
L291785	u5933	m392	WILL	Good night.
L291784	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
L291782	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Perhaps I'll see you in church.
L291781	u5933	m392	WILL	Thank you.
L291780	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
L291779	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
L291778	u5933	m392	WILL	Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
L291768	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
L291767	u5933	m392	WILL	What was she afraid of?
L291745	u5933	m392	WILL	How can I help you?
L291744	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
L291743	u5933	m392	WILL	And you...are?
L291742	u5931	m392	SEAMUS	You must be the new tenants.
L291990	u5932	m392	SHEA	I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
L291989	u5933	m392	WILL	Well what is it!
L291988	u5932	m392	SHEA	There's something through that wall!
L291987	u5933	m392	WILL	What?
L291986	u5932	m392	SHEA	There's something in there.
L291946	u5933	m392	WILL	Not at all, if it can help.
L291945	u5932	m392	SHEA	Do you mind if I borrow it?
L291942	u5933	m392	WILL	Runic?
L291941	u5932	m392	SHEA	I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
L291940	u5933	m392	WILL	It was nailed to the cellar wall.
L291939	u5932	m392	SHEA	Where did you find this?
L291937	u5933	m392	WILL	Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
L291936	u5932	m392	SHEA	Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
L291929	u5932	m392	SHEA	Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
L291928	u5933	m392	WILL	So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
L291927	u5932	m392	SHEA	Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
L291901	u5932	m392	SHEA	Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
L291900	u5933	m392	WILL	And what would you do?
L291899	u5932	m392	SHEA	Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
L291897	u5933	m392	WILL	Oh.
L291896	u5932	m392	SHEA	No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
L292308	u5937	m393	JOEY	No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
L292307	u5934	m393	BRAD	Not on station time.
L292303	u5934	m393	BRAD	And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
L292302	u5937	m393	JOEY	I know what I saw.
L292301	u5934	m393	BRAD	Right.  Like last night's doozie.
L292300	u5937	m393	JOEY	Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
L292299	u5934	m393	BRAD	C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
L292296	u5937	m393	JOEY	Jesus Christ ...
L292295	u5934	m393	BRAD	What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
L292293	u5934	m393	BRAD	I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
L292292	u5937	m393	JOEY	What do you mean?
L292643	u5937	m393	JOEY	Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
L292642	u5935	m393	DOC	You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
L292641	u5937	m393	JOEY	Hello?
L292270	u5937	m393	JOEY	That is the story of my life.
L292269	u5935	m393	DOC	OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
L292268	u5937	m393	JOEY	You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
L292267	u5935	m393	DOC	Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
L292266	u5937	m393	JOEY	Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
L292261	u5935	m393	DOC	Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
L292260	u5937	m393	JOEY	I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
L292639	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
L292638	u5937	m393	JOEY	Wha .... ?
L292637	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	Your apartment.
L292636	u5937	m393	JOEY	So where is it?
L292635	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
L292634	u5937	m393	JOEY	Then tell me what to do.
L292633	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
L292632	u5937	m393	JOEY	I don't know ...
L292631	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
L292630	u5937	m393	JOEY	What can we do?
L292629	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
L292628	u5937	m393	JOEY	What will he do?  What does he want?
L292627	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
L292626	u5937	m393	JOEY	Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
L292624	u5937	m393	JOEY	And why are you back?  Why are we here?
L292623	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	Something bad.
L292622	u5937	m393	JOEY	And what did you discover?
L292621	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
L292620	u5937	m393	JOEY	And what is ... this frozen moment?
L292619	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
L292617	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
L292616	u5937	m393	JOEY	Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
L292615	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
L292613	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
L292612	u5937	m393	JOEY	It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
L292611	u5936	m393	ELLIOTT	You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
L292610	u5937	m393	JOEY	Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
L292448	u5937	m393	JOEY	Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
L292447	u5942	m393	TERRI	Joey ... ?
L292444	u5937	m393	JOEY	God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
L292443	u5942	m393	TERRI	What am I looking for?
L292420	u5942	m393	TERRI	Here!  Here!  Pull over!
L292419	u5937	m393	JOEY	Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
L292418	u5942	m393	TERRI	For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
L292417	u5937	m393	JOEY	Oh, Terri ...
L292416	u5942	m393	TERRI	Buying some drugs, alright?
L292415	u5937	m393	JOEY	Terri?
L292414	u5937	m393	JOEY	What on earth were you doing down here?
L292413	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
L292412	u5937	m393	JOEY	Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
L292411	u5937	m393	JOEY	It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
L292410	u5942	m393	TERRI	Sure.  Why?
L292409	u5937	m393	JOEY	Would you know this store again?
L292408	u5942	m393	TERRI	I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
L292407	u5937	m393	JOEY	That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
L292406	u5942	m393	TERRI	No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
L292405	u5937	m393	JOEY	Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
L292404	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
L292403	u5937	m393	JOEY	Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
L292402	u5942	m393	TERRI	But I don't know what's going on.
L292398	u5937	m393	JOEY	No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
L292397	u5942	m393	TERRI	Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
L292396	u5937	m393	JOEY	Every day.
L292395	u5942	m393	TERRI	And he still sits there?
L292394	u5937	m393	JOEY	I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
L292393	u5942	m393	TERRI	Who's that?
L292392	u5937	m393	JOEY	... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
L292389	u5937	m393	JOEY	I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
L292388	u5942	m393	TERRI	Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
L292387	u5937	m393	JOEY	No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
L292386	u5942	m393	TERRI	Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
L292385	u5942	m393	TERRI	Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
L292384	u5937	m393	JOEY	How have you ... ?
L292383	u5942	m393	TERRI	Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
L292382	u5937	m393	JOEY	The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
L292381	u5942	m393	TERRI	This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
L292380	u5937	m393	JOEY	No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
L292379	u5942	m393	TERRI	I'll do it!
L292378	u5937	m393	JOEY	I'll boil some water.
L292377	u5942	m393	TERRI	Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
L292376	u5937	m393	JOEY	Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
L292375	u5942	m393	TERRI	I figured I'd make breakfast.
L292364	u5942	m393	TERRI	That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
L292363	u5937	m393	JOEY	Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
L292362	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
L292361	u5937	m393	JOEY	Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
L292360	u5942	m393	TERRI	The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
L292359	u5937	m393	JOEY	Taken what?
L292358	u5942	m393	TERRI	No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
L292357	u5937	m393	JOEY	Did you know him?
L292356	u5942	m393	TERRI	But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
L292355	u5937	m393	JOEY	Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
L292354	u5942	m393	TERRI	Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
L292352	u5942	m393	TERRI	It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
L292351	u5937	m393	JOEY	Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
L292350	u5942	m393	TERRI	Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
L292349	u5937	m393	JOEY	I'm trying to quit.
L292348	u5942	m393	TERRI	Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
L292344	u5937	m393	JOEY	I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
L292343	u5942	m393	TERRI	No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
L292342	u5937	m393	JOEY	What?
L292341	u5942	m393	TERRI	That's great.
L292340	u5937	m393	JOEY	God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
L292339	u5942	m393	TERRI	Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
L292338	u5937	m393	JOEY	No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
L292337	u5942	m393	TERRI	Sorry.
L292336	u5937	m393	JOEY	Why are you so interested?
L292335	u5942	m393	TERRI	What is it?
L292334	u5937	m393	JOEY	... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
L292333	u5937	m393	JOEY	Oh yeah ...
L292332	u5942	m393	TERRI	Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
L292331	u5937	m393	JOEY	What?
L292329	u5942	m393	TERRI	Right.
L292328	u5937	m393	JOEY	I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
L292324	u5937	m393	JOEY	No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
L292323	u5942	m393	TERRI	Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
L292322	u5937	m393	JOEY	Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
L292321	u5942	m393	TERRI	Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
L292320	u5937	m393	JOEY	I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
L292319	u5942	m393	TERRI	Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
L292318	u5937	m393	JOEY	Right.  Right!
L292317	u5942	m393	TERRI	You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
L292316	u5937	m393	JOEY	Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
L292315	u5942	m393	TERRI	Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
L292314	u5937	m393	JOEY	Uh-huh?
L292289	u5937	m393	JOEY	Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
L292288	u5942	m393	TERRI	Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
L292287	u5937	m393	JOEY	Where?
L292286	u5942	m393	TERRI	Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
L292285	u5942	m393	TERRI	It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
L292284	u5937	m393	JOEY	Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
L292279	u5937	m393	JOEY	What happened to him?
L292278	u5942	m393	TERRI	It was off the statue.  In the club.
L292441	u5939	m393	MAMA	Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
L292440	u5937	m393	JOEY	I don't know.  Maybe.
L292439	u5939	m393	MAMA	You gonna buy?
L292438	u5937	m393	JOEY	Can we see?
L292437	u5939	m393	MAMA	Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
L292436	u5937	m393	JOEY	What else came with it?  Anything still here?
L292435	u5939	m393	MAMA	It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
L292434	u5937	m393	JOEY	Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
L292433	u5939	m393	MAMA	Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
L292428	u5939	m393	MAMA	I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
L292427	u5937	m393	JOEY	No.  We want ...
L292426	u5939	m393	MAMA	Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
L292425	u5937	m393	JOEY	No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
L292424	u5939	m393	MAMA	No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
L292493	u5938	m393	JP	Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
L292492	u5941	m393	SANDY	You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
L292491	u5938	m393	JP	I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
L292490	u5941	m393	SANDY	You shit.  Who do you think you are?
L292489	u5938	m393	JP	And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
L292488	u5941	m393	SANDY	But you gave me a rose ...
L292487	u5941	m393	SANDY	Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
L292486	u5938	m393	JP	It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
L292484	u5938	m393	JP	Unh-unh.
L292483	u5941	m393	SANDY	Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
L292471	u5938	m393	JP	No.  Thank you.
L292470	u5941	m393	SANDY	Wow.  Thank you.
L292469	u5938	m393	JP	Yes really.
L292468	u5941	m393	SANDY	No.  Really?
L292467	u5938	m393	JP	... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
L292466	u5938	m393	JP	Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
L292465	u5941	m393	SANDY	Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
L292464	u5938	m393	JP	Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
L292463	u5941	m393	SANDY	I'm sorry.
L292462	u5938	m393	JP	He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
L292461	u5941	m393	SANDY	The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
L292460	u5938	m393	JP	You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
L292459	u5941	m393	SANDY	A prize?  For what?
L292458	u5938	m393	JP	It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
L292457	u5941	m393	SANDY	Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
L292456	u5938	m393	JP	Thank you.
L292455	u5941	m393	SANDY	And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
L292454	u5938	m393	JP	Uh-huh.
L292453	u5941	m393	SANDY	You're JP Monroe, right?
L292452	u5938	m393	JP	Welcome. 38
L292521	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	It has already begun.
L292520	u5938	m393	JP	How do we start?
L292519	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
L292518	u5938	m393	JP	But how in God's name ...
L292517	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	You see, we're not so dissimilar.
L292516	u5938	m393	JP	Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
L292515	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
L292513	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
L292512	u5938	m393	JP	What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
L292511	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
L292509	u5938	m393	JP	Fuck you!
L292508	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
L292503	u5938	m393	JP	No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
L292502	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
L292501	u5938	m393	JP	Yes.
L292500	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
L292499	u5938	m393	JP	That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
L292498	u5940	m393	PINHEAD	What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
L292497	u5938	m393	JP	What ... What ... ?
L292583	u5938	m393	JP	Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
L292582	u5942	m393	TERRI	Really?
L292581	u5938	m393	JP	Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
L292580	u5942	m393	TERRI	No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
L292579	u5938	m393	JP	That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
L292578	u5938	m393	JP	Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
L292577	u5942	m393	TERRI	I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
L292576	u5938	m393	JP	Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
L292575	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yeah right.  Look ...
L292574	u5938	m393	JP	Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
L292573	u5942	m393	TERRI	A girl?  Anyone I should know?
L292572	u5938	m393	JP	Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
L292571	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
L292570	u5938	m393	JP	No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
L292569	u5942	m393	TERRI	Not quite.  This wasn't here.
L292547	u5938	m393	JP	C'mon.  It'll be great.
L292546	u5942	m393	TERRI	Oh, I don't ...
L292545	u5938	m393	JP	Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
L292544	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yes. 53
L292543	u5938	m393	JP	That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
L292542	u5942	m393	TERRI	I miss you too.
L292541	u5938	m393	JP	I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
L292540	u5942	m393	TERRI	Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
L292539	u5938	m393	JP	Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
L292538	u5942	m393	TERRI	You're apologizing?
L292537	u5938	m393	JP	No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
L292536	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yeah really.  I'm ...
L292535	u5938	m393	JP	Really?
L292534	u5942	m393	TERRI	Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
L292533	u5938	m393	JP	Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
L292532	u5942	m393	TERRI	Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
L292530	u5942	m393	TERRI	What do you want?
L292529	u5938	m393	JP	Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
L292528	u5942	m393	TERRI	JP?
L292527	u5938	m393	JP	Not quite.
L292526	u5942	m393	TERRI	Joey?
L296233	u5975	m396	ALMA	Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
L296232	u5976	m396	BETSY	Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
L296231	u5975	m396	ALMA	No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
L296230	u5976	m396	BETSY	You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
L296229	u5975	m396	ALMA	They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
L296228	u5976	m396	BETSY	That's nonsense, Alma.
L296227	u5975	m396	ALMA	At the Houmfort.
L296226	u5976	m396	BETSY	Where?
L296225	u5975	m396	ALMA	There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
L296224	u5976	m396	BETSY	"What do you mean -- ""doctors that are people""?"
L296223	u5975	m396	ALMA	Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
L296222	u5976	m396	BETSY	Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
L296221	u5975	m396	ALMA	Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
L296076	u5976	m396	BETSY	Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
L296075	u5975	m396	ALMA	"A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says ""brioche."""
L296074	u5976	m396	BETSY	What's this?
L296073	u5975	m396	ALMA	I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
L296072	u5976	m396	BETSY	We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
L296071	u5975	m396	ALMA	She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
L296070	u5976	m396	BETSY	She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
L296069	u5975	m396	ALMA	Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
L296068	u5976	m396	BETSY	Thank you, Alma.
L296067	u5975	m396	ALMA	I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
L296066	u5976	m396	BETSY	But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
L296064	u5975	m396	ALMA	I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
L296063	u5976	m396	BETSY	Thank you for waking me.
L296062	u5975	m396	ALMA	Good morning, miss.
L296008	u5977	m396	COACHMAN	If you say, miss.  If you say.
L296007	u5976	m396	BETSY	But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
L296006	u5977	m396	COACHMAN	If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
L296005	u5976	m396	BETSY	You mean a figurehead.
L296004	u5977	m396	COACHMAN	No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
L296003	u5976	m396	BETSY	Alive?
L296002	u5977	m396	COACHMAN	A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
L296001	u5976	m396	BETSY	Ti-Misery?  What's that?
L296000	u5977	m396	COACHMAN	Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
L296348	u5976	m396	BETSY	Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
L296347	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
L296346	u5976	m396	BETSY	Mrs. Rand...
L296326	u5976	m396	BETSY	That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
L296325	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
L296262	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
L296261	u5976	m396	BETSY	But you didn't have to come up here.
L296260	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
L296259	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
L296258	u5976	m396	BETSY	But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
L296257	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
L296256	u5976	m396	BETSY	But, Mrs. Rand --
L296255	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
L296254	u5976	m396	BETSY	Mrs. Rand.
L296244	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
L296243	u5976	m396	BETSY	"I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been ""mindless""..."
L296242	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
L296241	u5976	m396	BETSY	I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
L296240	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
L296239	u5976	m396	BETSY	You don't believe in it?
L296238	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
L296237	u5976	m396	BETSY	You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
L296236	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
L296165	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
L296164	u5976	m396	BETSY	I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
L296163	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
L296162	u5976	m396	BETSY	I'd love to.
L296161	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
L296160	u5976	m396	BETSY	Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
L296159	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
L296158	u5976	m396	BETSY	Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
L296157	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
L296156	u5976	m396	BETSY	Oh, Mrs. Rand --
L296155	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
L296149	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Ti-Joseph?
L296148	u5976	m396	BETSY	I'm afraid so.
L296147	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	I think you need some help.
L296341	u5976	m396	BETSY	I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
L296340	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
L296206	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
L296205	u5976	m396	BETSY	I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
L296099	u5976	m396	BETSY	Thank you.
L296098	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
L296096	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
L296095	u5976	m396	BETSY	Is this disease common in the tropics?
L296094	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	I've never heard of a cure.
L296093	u5976	m396	BETSY	She can never be cured?
L296092	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
L296091	u5976	m396	BETSY	Does she suffer?
L295987	u5983	m396	WILKENS	That's rather nice, isn't it?
L295986	u5976	m396	BETSY	But it's so far away...
L295985	u5983	m396	WILKENS	A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
L295984	u5976	m396	BETSY	The West Indies?
L295983	u5983	m396	WILKENS	No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
L295982	u5976	m396	BETSY	That will mean another interview, won't it?
L295981	u5983	m396	WILKENS	I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
L295980	u5976	m396	BETSY	That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
L295979	u5983	m396	WILKENS	Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
L295978	u5976	m396	BETSY	They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
L295976	u5976	m396	BETSY	At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
L295975	u5983	m396	WILKENS	Where were you trained?
L295974	u5976	m396	BETSY	Yes.
L295973	u5983	m396	WILKENS	You're single?
L296385	u5982	m396	RAND	Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
L296384	u5976	m396	BETSY	No, Wes.
L296380	u5976	m396	BETSY	Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
L296379	u5982	m396	RAND	You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
L296378	u5976	m396	BETSY	But she's not dead, Wes.
L296377	u5982	m396	RAND	She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
L296376	u5976	m396	BETSY	Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
L296375	u5982	m396	RAND	She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
L296374	u5976	m396	BETSY	I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
L296373	u5982	m396	RAND	Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
L296372	u5976	m396	BETSY	Of course, Wes.
L296371	u5982	m396	RAND	Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
L296141	u5982	m396	RAND	"One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  ""You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?""  What he could do to that word ""beautiful."" That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists."
L296140	u5976	m396	BETSY	I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
L296139	u5982	m396	RAND	That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
L296138	u5976	m396	BETSY	That doesn't sound like him.
L296137	u5982	m396	RAND	Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
L296136	u5976	m396	BETSY	I wish I hadn't heard --
L296135	u5982	m396	RAND	Did you hear what he sang?
L296134	u5976	m396	BETSY	Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
L296125	u5976	m396	BETSY	Wait. I want to listen.
L296124	u5982	m396	RAND	Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
L296122	u5976	m396	BETSY	I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
L296121	u5982	m396	RAND	How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
L296120	u5976	m396	BETSY	Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
L296119	u5982	m396	RAND	What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
L296118	u5976	m396	BETSY	It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
L296117	u5982	m396	RAND	Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
L296116	u5982	m396	RAND	By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
L296115	u5976	m396	BETSY	But don't you have to work?
L296114	u5982	m396	RAND	Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
L296113	u5976	m396	BETSY	I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
L296112	u5982	m396	RAND	But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
L296111	u5976	m396	BETSY	It's my day off.
L296110	u5982	m396	RAND	Where do you think you're going?
L296035	u5982	m396	RAND	It'll wait.
L296034	u5976	m396	BETSY	Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
L296033	u5982	m396	RAND	Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
L296032	u5976	m396	BETSY	I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
L296031	u5982	m396	RAND	Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
L296030	u5976	m396	BETSY	Mr. Holland?
L296029	u5982	m396	RAND	Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
L296028	u5976	m396	BETSY	Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
L296027	u5982	m396	RAND	As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
L296025	u5982	m396	RAND	We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
L296024	u5976	m396	BETSY	I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
L296023	u5982	m396	RAND	I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
L296022	u5976	m396	BETSY	-- But, you're an American?
L296020	u5982	m396	RAND	My brother's wife.
L296019	u5976	m396	BETSY	Thank you.  But who sits there? 
L296018	u5982	m396	RAND	And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
L296017	u5976	m396	BETSY	I like her already.
L296016	u5982	m396	RAND	No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
L296015	u5976	m396	BETSY	Is she a doctor?
L296014	u5982	m396	RAND	And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
L296013	u5976	m396	BETSY	Yes -- on the boat.
L296012	u5982	m396	RAND	It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
L296322	u5976	m396	BETSY	I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
L296321	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
L296317	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Yes.
L296316	u5976	m396	BETSY	You want that?
L296315	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
L296314	u5976	m396	BETSY	That's past -- that's over and done with...
L296313	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
L296312	u5976	m396	BETSY	Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
L296311	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
L296310	u5976	m396	BETSY	You wanted to warn me...
L296309	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
L296308	u5976	m396	BETSY	I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
L296307	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
L296306	u5976	m396	BETSY	You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
L296305	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
L296304	u5976	m396	BETSY	I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
L296277	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I hated her.
L296276	u5976	m396	BETSY	She was beautiful.
L296275	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
L296273	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
L296272	u5976	m396	BETSY	You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
L296271	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
L296270	u5976	m396	BETSY	I told you.
L296269	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
L296268	u5976	m396	BETSY	I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
L296267	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Help me? How?
L296266	u5976	m396	BETSY	I wanted to help you.
L296217	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
L296216	u5976	m396	BETSY	And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
L296215	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	"I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, ""Paul, darling...""  The whole thing beginning all over again..."
L296214	u5976	m396	BETSY	I imagined this so differently...
L296213	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
L296212	u5976	m396	BETSY	She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
L296211	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Well?
L296199	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
L296198	u5976	m396	BETSY	You didn't drive her mad.
L296197	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
L296196	u5976	m396	BETSY	I love Fort Holland.
L296195	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
L296194	u5976	m396	BETSY	I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
L296193	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Why did you come in here?
L296192	u5976	m396	BETSY	I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
L296191	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I often do.
L296190	u5976	m396	BETSY	I heard you playing.
L296180	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
L296179	u5976	m396	BETSY	You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
L296178	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
L296177	u5976	m396	BETSY	Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
L296176	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
L296175	u5976	m396	BETSY	But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
L296174	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
L296173	u5976	m396	BETSY	Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
L296172	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Wesley can be very entertaining.
L296171	u5976	m396	BETSY	Well, I had a good time up to a point.
L296170	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	"I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first ""day off,"" too."
L296169	u5976	m396	BETSY	Good morning.
L296168	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Good morning, Miss Connell.
L296108	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
L296107	u5976	m396	BETSY	I've never given it much thought.
L296106	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	And charming?
L296105	u5976	m396	BETSY	I suppose so.  Yes.
L296103	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Many people thought her beautiful.
L296102	u5976	m396	BETSY	Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
L296101	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
L296087	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
L296086	u5976	m396	BETSY	I'm sorry...
L296085	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	A mental case?
L296084	u5976	m396	BETSY	Of course not!
L296083	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
L296082	u5976	m396	BETSY	Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
L296081	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
L296080	u5976	m396	BETSY	If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
L296079	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
L296078	u5976	m396	BETSY	I am not a frightened girl.
L296077	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
L296060	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
L296059	u5976	m396	BETSY	A figure of St. Sebastian.
L296058	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
L296057	u5976	m396	BETSY	Why was the maid crying?
L296050	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
L296049	u5976	m396	BETSY	I heard someone crying -- a woman --
L296041	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
L296040	u5976	m396	BETSY	Can't I take it for you?
L296038	u5976	m396	BETSY	Yes, thank you.
L296037	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Have the servants made you comfortable?
L295995	u5976	m396	BETSY	You can't really believe that.
L295994	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
L295993	u5976	m396	BETSY	You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
L295992	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	It is not beautiful.
L296361	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
L296360	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
L296359	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
L296358	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
L296357	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
L296356	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
L296355	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
L296352	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
L296351	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
L296296	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
L296295	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Wesley!
L296288	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
L296287	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
L296286	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
L296363	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
L296362	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
L296338	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
L296337	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
L296336	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	In other words, I'm on trial.
L296335	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
L296334	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Investigation of what?
L296333	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
L296332	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	What about her?
L296331	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
L296330	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	An accident at the mill?
L296281	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
L296280	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
L296209	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
L296208	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
L296207	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	I don't know -- I don't know--
L296204	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
L296203	u5978	m396	DR. MAXWELL	Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
L296202	u5979	m396	HOLLAND	All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
L296301	u5982	m396	RAND	Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
L296300	u5980	m396	JEFFRIES	That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
L296299	u5982	m396	RAND	Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
L296298	u5980	m396	JEFFRIES	Why?
L296297	u5982	m396	RAND	I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
L296292	u5982	m396	RAND	It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
L296291	u5980	m396	JEFFRIES	I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
L296290	u5982	m396	RAND	To the asylum?
L296289	u5980	m396	JEFFRIES	If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
L296285	u5980	m396	JEFFRIES	No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
L296284	u5982	m396	RAND	Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
L296354	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
L296353	u5982	m396	RAND	That isn't true.  You never understood her.
L296345	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
L296344	u5982	m396	RAND	Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
L296343	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
L296342	u5982	m396	RAND	We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
L296329	u5982	m396	RAND	Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
L296328	u5981	m396	MRS. RAND	Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
L308511	u6016	m400	BROOKS	I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
L308510	u6020	m400	KARLA	What the hell would you call this?
L308509	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Sorry. Emergencies only.
L308508	u6020	m400	KARLA	What about a radio?
L308507	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
L308347	u6016	m400	BROOKS	July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
L308346	u6020	m400	KARLA	Wait...Did you say off-season?
L308345	u6016	m400	BROOKS	And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
L308344	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
L308340	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
L308339	u6020	m400	KARLA	Is that bad?
L308338	u6016	m400	BROOKS	You're in 201 and 202.
L308327	u6020	m400	KARLA	Checking in...Karla Wilson.
L308326	u6016	m400	BROOKS	What can I do for you?
L308505	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Phones went down a few minutes ago.
L308504	u6019	m400	JULIE	Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
L308501	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
L308500	u6019	m400	JULIE	I want off this island.
L308489	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Who? Who is here?
L308488	u6019	m400	JULIE	Listen to me. He's here.
L308349	u6016	m400	BROOKS	It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
L308348	u6019	m400	JULIE	Storm season?
L308343	u6019	m400	JULIE	We haven't exchanged anything.
L308342	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
L308341	u6019	m400	JULIE	Your what?
L308334	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
L308333	u6019	m400	JULIE	It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
L308262	u6017	m400	DAVE	The guy looks dead.
L308261	u6024	m400	RAY	No.
L308260	u6017	m400	DAVE	I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
L308258	u6017	m400	DAVE	No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
L308257	u6024	m400	RAY	I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
L308256	u6017	m400	DAVE	Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
L308254	u6017	m400	DAVE	Stupid. What were you thinkng?
L308253	u6024	m400	RAY	Stupid. Stupid.
L308243	u6017	m400	DAVE	Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
L308242	u6024	m400	RAY	You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
L308453	u6025	m400	TITUS	Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
L308452	u6018	m400	DERRICK	I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
L308451	u6025	m400	TITUS	Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
L308450	u6018	m400	DERRICK	There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
L308449	u6025	m400	TITUS	That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
L308448	u6018	m400	DERRICK	Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
L308447	u6025	m400	TITUS	Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
L308446	u6018	m400	DERRICK	Get lost, you scared me.
L308758	u6020	m400	KARLA	Is he?
L308757	u6019	m400	JULIE	You're okay. Thank god.
L308756	u6020	m400	KARLA	Oh, god, it's you --
L308713	u6020	m400	KARLA	...Nancy?
L308712	u6019	m400	JULIE	No, you're not.
L308711	u6020	m400	KARLA	I'm holding your hand!
L308708	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm right here. Grab my hand.
L308707	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie?
L308705	u6019	m400	JULIE	Come on, you can make it.
L308704	u6020	m400	KARLA	I don't know...
L308682	u6020	m400	KARLA	What do we do?
L308681	u6019	m400	JULIE	There's no way to lock it.
L308657	u6020	m400	KARLA	It's too late for that.
L308656	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
L308655	u6020	m400	KARLA	I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
L308643	u6019	m400	JULIE	Then, we fight --
L308642	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
L308638	u6019	m400	JULIE	I've got to see.
L308637	u6020	m400	KARLA	Be careful, Julie.
L308626	u6019	m400	JULIE	We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
L308625	u6020	m400	KARLA	I know I don't want to stay in here.
L308616	u6019	m400	JULIE	Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
L308615	u6020	m400	KARLA	What do you mean?
L308612	u6020	m400	KARLA	Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
L308611	u6019	m400	JULIE	Let him go. I believe him.
L308584	u6019	m400	JULIE	Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
L308583	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie...
L308582	u6019	m400	JULIE	They never found the body.
L308581	u6020	m400	KARLA	Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
L308570	u6020	m400	KARLA	I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
L308569	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
L308551	u6020	m400	KARLA	Just kidding.
L308550	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla!
L308547	u6020	m400	KARLA	No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
L308546	u6019	m400	JULIE	Cancer in a box.
L308535	u6020	m400	KARLA	I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
L308534	u6019	m400	JULIE	Nice move.
L308533	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
L308532	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
L308525	u6019	m400	JULIE	Some.
L308524	u6020	m400	KARLA	You get any sleep at all?
L308497	u6019	m400	JULIE	The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
L308496	u6020	m400	KARLA	Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
L308419	u6019	m400	JULIE	Not me...no way...
L308418	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yes.
L308417	u6019	m400	JULIE	No.
L308416	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yes.
L308415	u6019	m400	JULIE	No way.
L308411	u6020	m400	KARLA	Okay, I won't.
L308410	u6019	m400	JULIE	Don't even think about it.
L308409	u6020	m400	KARLA	Karaoke -- perfect.
L308397	u6019	m400	JULIE	I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
L308396	u6020	m400	KARLA	He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
L308395	u6019	m400	JULIE	Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
L308366	u6020	m400	KARLA	I also promised Tyrell.
L308365	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla! You promised.
L308364	u6020	m400	KARLA	Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
L308324	u6019	m400	JULIE	Where is everyone? I'll ask --
L308323	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hello? Hello?
L308296	u6019	m400	JULIE	I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
L308295	u6020	m400	KARLA	Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
L308294	u6020	m400	KARLA	No, I'm the King of the World.
L308293	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm the King of the World.
L308278	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
L308277	u6019	m400	JULIE	Oh!
L308275	u6019	m400	JULIE	Then, don't.
L308274	u6020	m400	KARLA	Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
L308273	u6019	m400	JULIE	He does work hard.
L308272	u6020	m400	KARLA	He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
L308271	u6019	m400	JULIE	But, he said he'd try.
L308270	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, you left four messages... Four.
L308269	u6019	m400	JULIE	He's not coming. I thought he was just...
L308246	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
L308245	u6020	m400	KARLA	You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
L308209	u6020	m400	KARLA	I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
L308208	u6019	m400	JULIE	Okay, okay. You're right.
L308207	u6020	m400	KARLA	Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
L308206	u6019	m400	JULIE	The number's unlisted...
L308205	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
L308204	u6019	m400	JULIE	That could break the machine.
L308195	u6020	m400	KARLA	Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
L308194	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
L308191	u6019	m400	JULIE	Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
L308190	u6020	m400	KARLA	No means yes.
L308189	u6019	m400	JULIE	No.
L308188	u6020	m400	KARLA	Say yes.
L308176	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yet. Nothing yet.
L308175	u6019	m400	JULIE	There's nothing between Will and me.
L308174	u6020	m400	KARLA	Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
L308173	u6019	m400	JULIE	I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
L308172	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yeah, right -- whatever.
L308171	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
L308170	u6020	m400	KARLA	No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
L308169	u6019	m400	JULIE	That was heart attack time, Karla.
L308168	u6020	m400	KARLA	i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
L308167	u6019	m400	JULIE	What are you doing in my closet?
L308166	u6020	m400	KARLA	I thought you were out of town!
L308165	u6019	m400	JULIE	What are you doing in my closet?
L308164	u6020	m400	KARLA	I thought you were out of town!
L308767	u6019	m400	JULIE	You know me to well.
L308766	u6024	m400	RAY	Checking the locks again?
L308765	u6024	m400	RAY	It's gonna be great.
L308764	u6019	m400	JULIE	I love it here.
L308763	u6024	m400	RAY	Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
L308762	u6019	m400	JULIE	Never do that again.
L308761	u6024	m400	RAY	Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
L308760	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray...what are you doing?
L308250	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
L308249	u6024	m400	RAY	Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
L308248	u6019	m400	JULIE	Will you try...for me, please?
L308247	u6024	m400	RAY	Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
L308241	u6024	m400	RAY	This weekend?
L308240	u6019	m400	JULIE	We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
L308239	u6024	m400	RAY	What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
L308238	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
L308236	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's okay.
L308235	u6024	m400	RAY	No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
L308234	u6019	m400	JULIE	No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
L308233	u6024	m400	RAY	Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
L308158	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
L308157	u6024	m400	RAY	I understand something.
L308156	u6019	m400	JULIE	I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
L308155	u6024	m400	RAY	Can't what?
L308154	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, I can't...
L308152	u6019	m400	JULIE	Why are you being like this?
L308151	u6024	m400	RAY	Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
L308150	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, we're just friend.
L308149	u6024	m400	RAY	Yeah.
L308148	u6019	m400	JULIE	Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
L308147	u6024	m400	RAY	I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
L308669	u6019	m400	JULIE	Wait, it's Nancy --
L308668	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Don't kill me --
L308619	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
L308618	u6019	m400	JULIE	I don't know.
L308617	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
L308596	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I told you.
L308595	u6019	m400	JULIE	Voodoo.
L308580	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ben Willis.
L308579	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Who?
L308578	u6019	m400	JULIE	We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
L308495	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Fine. Show me the body.
L308494	u6019	m400	JULIE	I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
L308187	u6026	m400	TYRELL	That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
L308186	u6019	m400	JULIE	Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
L308185	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
L308741	u6027	m400	WILL	Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
L308740	u6019	m400	JULIE	...Why?
L308739	u6027	m400	WILL	We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
L308738	u6019	m400	JULIE	I trusted you.
L308737	u6027	m400	WILL	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
L308736	u6019	m400	JULIE	Why are you doing this to me?
L308721	u6027	m400	WILL	I guess so.
L308720	u6019	m400	JULIE	He's in it with Willis?
L308719	u6027	m400	WILL	Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
L308718	u6019	m400	JULIE	Did you get help?
L308717	u6027	m400	WILL	Come on. We're gonna be okay.
L308486	u6019	m400	JULIE	I wasn't dreaming.
L308485	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
L308484	u6019	m400	JULIE	There was a body! I swear it!
L308482	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's in my room!
L308481	u6027	m400	WILL	What? What are you talking about? Where?
L308436	u6019	m400	JULIE	Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
L308435	u6027	m400	WILL	Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
L308434	u6019	m400	JULIE	No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
L308433	u6027	m400	WILL	I scared you -- I crossed the line --
L308432	u6019	m400	JULIE	No, no, no. This was really sweet...
L308431	u6027	m400	WILL	It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
L308430	u6019	m400	JULIE	Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
L308427	u6019	m400	JULIE	He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
L308426	u6027	m400	WILL	What do you mean, Julie?
L308425	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's...him.
L308424	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie? What's wrong?
L308373	u6027	m400	WILL	You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
L308372	u6019	m400	JULIE	Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
L308371	u6027	m400	WILL	You sure it's okay with you?
L308353	u6019	m400	JULIE	It beets being on the mainland.
L308352	u6027	m400	WILL	And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
L308290	u6027	m400	WILL	Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
L308289	u6019	m400	JULIE	You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
L308288	u6027	m400	WILL	Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
L308287	u6019	m400	JULIE	Deep breaths --
L308286	u6027	m400	WILL	What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
L308285	u6019	m400	JULIE	Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
L308198	u6027	m400	WILL	I said, this...Do you want a drink?
L308197	u6019	m400	JULIE	What?
L308196	u6027	m400	WILL	This was not my idea.
L308143	u6027	m400	WILL	Are you sure?
L308142	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm okay.
L308141	u6027	m400	WILL	Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
L308140	u6019	m400	JULIE	Right. Now I remember.
L308139	u6027	m400	WILL	To get out of Southport?
L308138	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
L308137	u6027	m400	WILL	It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
L308136	u6019	m400	JULIE	It was one year ago...
L308135	u6019	m400	JULIE	It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
L308134	u6027	m400	WILL	It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
L308133	u6019	m400	JULIE	I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
L308132	u6027	m400	WILL	I'm sorry.
L308131	u6019	m400	JULIE	It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
L308130	u6027	m400	WILL	The shower again?
L308128	u6027	m400	WILL	You don't seem fine.
L308127	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm fine.
L308126	u6027	m400	WILL	You sure?
L308125	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm fine.
L308124	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie! Wait! You okay?
L308661	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I don't know, but I'm starving.
L308660	u6020	m400	KARLA	You think that's a good place to hide?
L308653	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
L308652	u6020	m400	KARLA	Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
L308650	u6020	m400	KARLA	Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
L308649	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'll come with you.
L308573	u6020	m400	KARLA	We gotta get out of here. Now.
L308572	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
L308528	u6026	m400	TYRELL	See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
L308527	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hey --
L308526	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
L308464	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
L308463	u6020	m400	KARLA	I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
L308460	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
L308459	u6020	m400	KARLA	Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
L308458	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Hello?
L308457	u6020	m400	KARLA	You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
L308441	u6020	m400	KARLA	'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
L308440	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Why?
L308439	u6020	m400	KARLA	Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
L308400	u6020	m400	KARLA	They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
L308399	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Pretty cool bar.
L308362	u6020	m400	KARLA	Rio, baby!
L308361	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Guess the capital of Brazil --
L308355	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
L308354	u6020	m400	KARLA	Oooh, the mainland --
L308351	u6026	m400	TYRELL	We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
L308350	u6020	m400	KARLA	Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
L308292	u6020	m400	KARLA	Honey, some folks just can't fly.
L308291	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
L308282	u6020	m400	KARLA	Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
L308281	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Is there a problem here?
L308193	u6020	m400	KARLA	Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
L308192	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
L308183	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'll talk real slow.
L308182	u6020	m400	KARLA	If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
L308181	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
L308180	u6020	m400	KARLA	I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
L308179	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
L308648	u6027	m400	WILL	He's probably the only one who can help us.
L308647	u6020	m400	KARLA	Why? He can't help us.
L308474	u6027	m400	WILL	Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
L308473	u6020	m400	KARLA	How's Julie?
L308472	u6027	m400	WILL	Ahh, that feels great.
L308421	u6020	m400	KARLA	Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
L308420	u6027	m400	WILL	Come on, it'll be fun.
L308405	u6027	m400	WILL	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
L308404	u6020	m400	KARLA	To a great weekend --
L308280	u6020	m400	KARLA	I said we start having fun. And that means now.
L308279	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
L308228	u6022	m400	MARK	We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
L308227	u6020	m400	KARLA	Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
L308225	u6020	m400	KARLA	No. Yes?
L308224	u6022	m400	MARK	Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
L308223	u6020	m400	KARLA	Rio de Janeiro!
L308222	u6022	m400	MARK	Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
L308221	u6020	m400	KARLA	Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
L308215	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yes!
L308214	u6022	m400	MARK	How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
L308213	u6020	m400	KARLA	Well, I'm in school and --
L308212	u6022	m400	MARK	Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
L308211	u6020	m400	KARLA	Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
L308520	u6024	m400	RAY	I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
L308519	u6021	m400	MAC	Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
L308518	u6024	m400	RAY	Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
L308517	u6021	m400	MAC	Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
L308516	u6024	m400	RAY	How much?
L308515	u6021	m400	MAC	Well, there's some flaws in her...
L308514	u6024	m400	RAY	How much?
L308513	u6021	m400	MAC	Jeez, that's a full carat --
L308674	u6023	m400	NANCY	Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
L308673	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Must have missed the sign.
L308672	u6023	m400	NANCY	You stumbled into my hiding place.
L308671	u6026	m400	TYRELL	And so could you -- crazy fool.
L308670	u6023	m400	NANCY	I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
L308493	u6026	m400	TYRELL	The rest of us see bathrobes.
L308492	u6023	m400	NANCY	Cool.
L308491	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
L308490	u6023	m400	NANCY	What's going on?
L308394	u6023	m400	NANCY	No. I shot him.
L308393	u6026	m400	TYRELL	He leave you?
L308392	u6023	m400	NANCY	Not anymore.
L308391	u6026	m400	TYRELL	What's the matter, boy trouble?
L308382	u6023	m400	NANCY	Wanna drink?

L308645	u6026	m400	TYRELL	What is up with that weirdo?
L308644	u6027	m400	WILL	Where'd Estes go?
L308603	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
L308602	u6027	m400	WILL	We'll only be a second, okay?
L308587	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
L308586	u6027	m400	WILL	The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
L308577	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
L308576	u6026	m400	TYRELL	They were cut loose.
L308559	u6027	m400	WILL	And do what with it?
L308558	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Take this.
L308542	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Hey -- shut up, okay?
L308541	u6027	m400	WILL	You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
L308540	u6026	m400	TYRELL	They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
L308537	u6027	m400	WILL	They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
L308536	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Where is everybody?
L308531	u6027	m400	WILL	You don't have to be a jerk.
L308530	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
L308470	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Crowded.
L308469	u6027	m400	WILL	How's the water?
L308468	u6026	m400	TYRELL	There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
L308389	u6027	m400	WILL	So why are you still here?
L308388	u6026	m400	TYRELL	The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
L308384	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
L308383	u6027	m400	WILL	We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
L308299	u6027	m400	WILL	See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
L308298	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Can't talk right now.
L309177	u6029	m401	CATHY	She's in her room.
L309176	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Where is Miss Wollsten?
L308897	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
L308896	u6029	m401	CATHY	How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
L308895	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
L308894	u6029	m401	CATHY	How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
L308893	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -? the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
L309242	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	May life be good to you both. As for the others ?? they will be quiet here ?? and I will be with them.
L309241	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Goodbye.
L309216	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
L309215	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
L309214	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Well ??
L309213	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
L309212	u6033	m401	OLIVER	All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
L309211	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
L309210	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I'll go up and take a look at the General ?- perhaps sit with him.
L309209	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
L309208	u6033	m401	OLIVER	It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
L309183	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	In case you do so, would you --
L309182	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
L308974	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Or even spirit messages from the next world.
L308973	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
L308938	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently ?? walked blindly.
L308934	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	He's dead. I want the General to see him.
L308933	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Drunk again?
L308932	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I need your advice ?? something has happened ?? Mr.  Jacks ??
L308838	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
L308837	u6033	m401	OLIVER	He is exhausted.
L308826	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You collect these to sell, abroad?
L308825	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
L308798	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
L308797	u6033	m401	OLIVER	This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
L308796	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
L309085	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
L309084	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
L309065	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
L309064	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	My friend -- what can one say --
L309063	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	) You feel the symptoms?
L309060	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
L309059	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
L309006	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
L309005	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	We will see who is the first to die.
L309004	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
L309003	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	You're just talking nonsense.
L309002	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
L309001	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
L308998	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
L308997	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
L308995	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Good winds and bad winds!
L308994	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
L309193	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
L309192	u6031	m401	GENERAL	No.  She shall not be left here.
L309191	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
L308960	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
L308959	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
L308958	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
L308944	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was ?- perhaps it was.
L308943	u6031	m401	GENERAL	We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
L308942	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'm not sure that it is the plague.
L308840	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
L308839	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
L308818	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I donut understand.
L308817	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'm afraid so. There were rumors ??people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
L308816	u6031	m401	GENERAL	All the graves?
L308815	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	There was some trouble here ??the villagers on the mainland ?-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ??broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
L308814	u6031	m401	GENERAL	But why?
L308813	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	They were gore before I came here.
L308812	u6031	m401	GENERAL	The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
L308800	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	This was once a cemetery.
L308799	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
L309180	u6029	m401	CATHY	I don't know now without my father.
L309179	u6033	m401	OLIVER	If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
L309094	u6029	m401	CATHY	If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
L309093	u6033	m401	OLIVER	There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
L309092	u6029	m401	CATHY	Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
L309091	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Poor Cathy --
L309090	u6029	m401	CATHY	My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
L309075	u6029	m401	CATHY	Closer and closer ?- until they bite into your throat!
L309074	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
L309073	u6029	m401	CATHY	Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
L309070	u6033	m401	OLIVER	On my word! That's what they believe.
L309069	u6029	m401	CATHY	Oh, no -? it's too delicious! You're making it up!
L309057	u6029	m401	CATHY	I think she went to bed ?? I saw her going toward the house
L309056	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Where's Thea?
L309008	u6029	m401	CATHY	No one can take my father's place.
L309007	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
L308967	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I think not.
L308966	u6029	m401	CATHY	You're not leaving tomorrow..?
L308965	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Sleep well.
L308964	u6029	m401	CATHY	Good night, Oliver.
L308947	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thank you.
L308946	u6033	m401	OLIVER	How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
L308945	u6029	m401	CATHY	I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
L308867	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
L308866	u6029	m401	CATHY	I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
L308862	u6029	m401	CATHY	M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
L308861	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
L308805	u6029	m401	CATHY	That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
L308804	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
L309205	u6031	m401	GENERAL	They shall not hurt you
L309204	u6029	m401	CATHY	Shh??? it's all right -? I'll be all right.
L309203	u6031	m401	GENERAL	In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then ?- I'll not die ?? I'll watch -? they shall not hurt you.
L309202	u6029	m401	CATHY	It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
L309163	u6029	m401	CATHY	No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
L309162	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
L309160	u6029	m401	CATHY	How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
L309159	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill ?? or frightened.
L309158	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I was looking for you.
L309157	u6029	m401	CATHY	What are you doing?
L309105	u6031	m401	GENERAL	How old is she?
L309104	u6029	m401	CATHY	She has never mentioned her family.
L309103	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
L309102	u6029	m401	CATHY	Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
L309101	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
L309099	u6029	m401	CATHY	I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
L309098	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
L309222	u6029	m401	CATHY	We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
L309221	u6035	m401	THEA	It was, the plague
L309220	u6029	m401	CATHY	Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
L309219	u6035	m401	THEA	She is dead ? at peace.
L309218	u6029	m401	CATHY	When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
L309217	u6035	m401	THEA	You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
L308927	u6035	m401	THEA	I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
L308926	u6029	m401	CATHY	That should decide it or you --
L308925	u6035	m401	THEA	I felt he did not like me.
L308923	u6035	m401	THEA	I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now ?- I don't know ??
L308922	u6029	m401	CATHY	Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
L308921	u6029	m401	CATHY	The General ? you don't even know him.
L308920	u6035	m401	THEA	But one must love a father.
L308919	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
L308907	u6035	m401	THEA	My last name is Pherides.
L308906	u6029	m401	CATHY	I have forgotten it, dear.
L308905	u6035	m401	THEA	You have forgotten my last name?
L308904	u6029	m401	CATHY	What is it -- what are you talking about?
L308903	u6035	m401	THEA	I do not know him, but I have seen him.
L308902	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
L308901	u6029	m401	CATHY	Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
L308900	u6035	m401	THEA	I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -?or just because he is one's father?
L308899	u6029	m401	CATHY	What an odd question!
L308898	u6035	m401	THEA	Cathy ?- how does it feel to have a father?
L308864	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thea is an orphan.
L308863	u6035	m401	THEA	You are fortunate in your father.
L308842	u6035	m401	THEA	And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
L308841	u6029	m401	CATHY	The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer ?? a correspondent of some sort ??
L309173	u6029	m401	CATHY	Wouldn't I?
L309172	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You wouldn't tell that ??
L309171	u6029	m401	CATHY	When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people ?- a cataleptic!
L309169	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
L309168	u6029	m401	CATHY	Really, this is idiotic!
L309167	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man ? ? working at him ? ? turning him against Thea.
L309166	u6029	m401	CATHY	Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
L309165	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours ?? but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
L309030	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	That your father and I ??
L309029	u6029	m401	CATHY	You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
L309028	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you ?- I'll warn them against you.
L309027	u6029	m401	CATHY	Why, I'm fond of Thea.
L309026	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints ?? the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
L309025	u6029	m401	CATHY	What if he is?
L309024	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ??young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
L309023	u6029	m401	CATHY	What would I be thinking?
L309022	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
L309021	u6029	m401	CATHY	You were father's secretary -? I never thought - -
L309020	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ??you've ruined mine ??
L309019	u6029	m401	CATHY	How do you know what my father thought - -
L309018	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
L309017	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed ? everytime you can't get your own way.
L309016	u6029	m401	CATHY	Miss Wollsten!
L309015	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are ?? a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
L309014	u6029	m401	CATHY	Whet do you mean?
L309013	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
L309155	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
L309154	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live ?- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
L309153	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
L309152	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
L309151	u6031	m401	GENERAL	If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
L309150	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure ?- quite sure.
L309149	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I don't understand you.
L309148	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep ?- I want to avoid it.
L309147	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Yes?
L309146	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
L309144	u6031	m401	GENERAL	He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
L309143	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
L309142	u6031	m401	GENERAL	He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
L309141	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in ?- entombed ?? imprisoned..
L309140	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Woman, what are you doing here?
L308981	u6031	m401	GENERAL	This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
L308980	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
L308860	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I will go with you.
L308859	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	This girl -- Thea ?- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
L308858	u6031	m401	GENERAL	This girl --
L308856	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Why -- no not before Thea came ??
L308855	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
L308854	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
L308853	u6031	m401	GENERAL	What is her illness?
L308852	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	She's not too well.
L308851	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Your daughter is ill.
L308850	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Miss Wollsten -? my secretary, she'd know.
L308849	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
L308847	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
L308846	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Her family name?
L308845	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Theodosia.
L308844	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Her name is Thea?
L308843	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice?Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
L309239	u6033	m401	OLIVER	She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
L309238	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Daughter -- my daughter --
L309237	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
L309236	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Theodosia --
L309199	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I shall not leave the island ??
L309198	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Come ?- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
L309197	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I have had command for the last time ?-
L309055	u6033	m401	OLIVER	When you make sense I'll listen.
L309054	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Listen to what I say --
L309053	u6033	m401	OLIVER	That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle ?-
L309052	u6031	m401	GENERAL	If I told you ?? you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you ?? the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -?
L309051	u6033	m401	OLIVER	And I'm your friend ?? but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
L309050	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You are my friend.
L309049	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I had a notion you had become self?appointed chaperone lately ? why?
L309048	u6031	m401	GENERAL	In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
L309047	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
L309046	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ??pale -- sick -- she died --
L309045	u6033	m401	OLIVER	How did she die?
L309044	u6031	m401	GENERAL	She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
L309043	u6033	m401	OLIVER	If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
L309042	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Thea is so like her ?? in every feature ??
L308972	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
L308971	u6033	m401	OLIVER	We still don't know that it's the plague ??
L308970	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Better no general than one carrying the plague.
L308969	u6033	m401	OLIVER	But the war, the army ?? they need you.
L308968	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
L308941	u6031	m401	GENERAL	The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
L308940	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
L308939	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I've seen men die drunk ?- and I've seen men die of the plague.
L308929	u6031	m401	GENERAL	We have no time for that.
L308928	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
L308918	u6031	m401	GENERAL	It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
L308917	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I can't understand that.
L308916	u6031	m401	GENERAL	It makes me fear her.
L308915	u6033	m401	OLIVER	But that should make you like her.
L308914	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I know all you are going to say ?-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -?there is something about her ??the way she moves ?? the way she turns her head.
L308913	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Oh, now ?? now look here ??
L308912	u6031	m401	GENERAL	There is something evil about her.
L308911	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Thea?
L308910	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ??
L308909	u6033	m401	OLIVER	It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
L308908	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in ?- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me ?? a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
L308792	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Maybe you've got the wrong crypt ?? after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
L308791	u6031	m401	GENERAL	She is not there. The coffin is gone.
L308787	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
L308786	u6031	m401	GENERAL	There's no one there -? nothing but the caves and the dead.
L308785	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Do you mind if I go with you?
L308783	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You were at those battles as a spectator ? ? I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me ?? those men out there ?? dead or dying ?? by my order -- because I willed it so.
L308782	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
L308781	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You know that sound, Oliver?
L308779	u6033	m401	OLIVER	In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
L308778	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Hero?
L308777	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
L309138	u6035	m401	THEA	No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it ?- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
L309137	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -?
L309136	u6035	m401	THEA	For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
L309135	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
L309133	u6035	m401	THEA	Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
L309132	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
L309131	u6035	m401	THEA	It is for that he hates me.
L309130	u6033	m401	OLIVER	"Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? ""He stole your mother"" ?-"
L309129	u6035	m401	THEA	It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
L309128	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
L309127	u6035	m401	THEA	He hates all my race.
L309126	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Why in the world can't you?
L309125	u6035	m401	THEA	I can't.
L309124	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Well, tell, him.
L309123	u6035	m401	THEA	He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
L309122	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble ?? the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
L309121	u6035	m401	THEA	The General threatened me.
L309120	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Thea, what's wrong?
L309072	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You see? Thea believes it, too!
L309071	u6035	m401	THEA	Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
L309038	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
L309037	u6035	m401	THEA	Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
L309036	u6033	m401	OLIVER	What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
L309035	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Everything's so simple. I like you.
L309034	u6035	m401	THEA	I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
L309033	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You're crying. Why?
L330610	u6151	m410	AJAY	No.  I feel something.
L330609	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You hear something?
L330401	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
L330400	u6151	m410	AJAY	Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
L330376	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It certainly does.
L330375	u6151	m410	AJAY	It matches the pictures.
L330232	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
L330231	u6151	m410	AJAY	You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
L330230	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Sorry.  We were saying?
L330222	u6159	m410	ROLAND	A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
L330221	u6151	m410	AJAY	How do you mean?
L330220	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Just a little bit too much, I think.
L330219	u6151	m410	AJAY	But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
L330218	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
L330217	u6151	m410	AJAY	I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
L330216	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
L330215	u6151	m410	AJAY	You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
L330214	u6159	m410	ROLAND	That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
L330213	u6151	m410	AJAY	How did you know?
L330383	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
L330382	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
L330302	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
L330301	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there an antidote?
L330254	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
L330253	u6152	m410	EDDIE	It doesn't matter what I think.
L330252	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
L330251	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
L330250	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You are an academic.
L330249	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
L330248	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Minimal is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
L330247	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Minimal.
L330246	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Any damage?
L330197	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
L330196	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm not going, John.
L330194	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
L330193	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John . . .
L330192	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
L330191	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So what?
L330190	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
L330189	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
L330188	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
L330187	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
L330186	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
L330185	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't believe you.
L330184	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
L330183	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What are you talking about?
L330182	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
L330181	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330180	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
L330179	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
L330178	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
L330177	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't know you -- weren't well.
L330176	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
L330175	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Resentful.
L330533	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Everyone, keep your voices down!
L330532	u6158	m410	NICK	Are you looking for a problem?
L330395	u6158	m410	NICK	You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
L330394	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	But he's the head of InGen!
L330390	u6158	m410	NICK	Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
L330389	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
L330337	u6158	m410	NICK	-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
L330336	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
L330304	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	-- my --
L330303	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh --
L330324	u6160	m410	SARAH	We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
L330323	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
L330322	u6160	m410	SARAH	Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
L330321	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
L330320	u6160	m410	SARAH	And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
L330316	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
L330315	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
L330312	u6160	m410	SARAH	Not without a shot of the nest.
L330311	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
L330309	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I want to see the nesting ground!
L330308	u6160	m410	SARAH	That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
L330710	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Come on!
L330709	u6155	m410	KELLY	Dad!
L330526	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm fine... I'm fine...
L330525	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
L330524	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
L330425	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
L330424	u6155	m410	KELLY	What are you guys gonna do?
L330388	u6155	m410	KELLY	On the side of that one truck.
L330387	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where does it say that?
L330386	u6155	m410	KELLY	InGen.  What's InGen?
L330349	u6155	m410	KELLY	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
L330348	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	How could you possibly?
L330279	u6155	m410	KELLY	You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
L330278	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
L330277	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
L330276	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
L330275	u6155	m410	KELLY	I could come with you.
L330274	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That Richard.
L330273	u6155	m410	KELLY	No.  Richard talked to his parents.
L330272	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, is he?
L330271	u6155	m410	KELLY	That was about a year ago.
L330270	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
L330269	u6155	m410	KELLY	Which one?
L330268	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is that kid still bothering you?
L330267	u6155	m410	KELLY	No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
L330266	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
L330265	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
L330264	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
L330263	u6155	m410	KELLY	My vacation is over in a week.
L330262	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
L330261	u6155	m410	KELLY	Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
L330260	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
L330259	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't even know this woman.
L330258	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
L330256	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Kelly!  What are you doing here?
L330255	u6155	m410	KELLY	Hi, Dad.
L330677	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
L330676	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
L330675	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
L330674	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	It's... behind... us.
L330672	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why?
L330671	u6159	m410	ROLAND	We took to the rock.
L330662	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Possible.
L330661	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
L330650	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good.
L330649	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
L330644	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Operations building.  Far end of the street.
L330643	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Where's the power and radio setup?
L330637	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Piss.
L330636	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What is that?
L330550	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The velociraptors.
L330549	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What is?
L330450	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Isn't it obvious?
L330449	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What in Christ's name is going on?!
L330443	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
L330442	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You've broken its leg!
L330441	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
L330439	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
L330438	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What?
L330437	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
L330436	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
L330435	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
L330434	u6159	m410	ROLAND	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
L330433	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You rally think this'll draw the parent?
L330431	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
L330430	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
L330429	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	How close do you have to be?
L330428	u6159	m410	ROLAND	My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
L330427	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What kind of gun is that?
L330379	u6159	m410	ROLAND	To collect my fee.
L330378	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Where do you think you're going?!
L330364	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good lad.
L330363	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Okay.
L330362	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
L330361	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
L330360	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
L330359	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What?  Why?
L330358	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Cancel that, Dieter.
L330652	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Piss.
L330651	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What's he got in there?
L330210	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
L330209	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
L330208	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
L330207	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
L330206	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You version of it.
L330205	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
L330204	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
L330203	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
L330202	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
L330201	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
L330200	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
L330665	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
L330664	u6160	m410	SARAH	You're going too?
L330663	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You know how to work a radio, don't you?
L330654	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
L330653	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?
L330537	u6160	m410	SARAH	Oh, God.
L330536	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Their what?
L330529	u6160	m410	SARAH	Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
L330528	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
L330706	u6158	m410	NICK	Look!  Sarah!
L330705	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Something's wrong.
L330701	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
L330700	u6158	m410	NICK	I think she's with Sarah!
L330699	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I have to find Kelly!
L330698	u6158	m410	NICK	Head for the roof!
L330697	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
L330696	u6158	m410	NICK	It'll hold!
L330695	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
L330694	u6158	m410	NICK	"We're sure as hell not going back out there"""
L330693	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We can't stay in here!
L330691	u6158	m410	NICK	She's with Sarah!
L330690	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where's Kelly?
L330689	u6158	m410	NICK	Come on!
L330648	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't know.
L330647	u6158	m410	NICK	What are they?
L330646	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330645	u6158	m410	NICK	Lava?
L330501	u6158	m410	NICK	No way.
L330500	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330485	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What do you think they want?!
L330484	u6158	m410	NICK	What do they want?!
L330458	u6158	m410	NICK	No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
L330457	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
L330456	u6158	m410	NICK	It has a broken leg!
L330455	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	?!
L330423	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
L330422	u6158	m410	NICK	There' no reason for name calling.
L330420	u6158	m410	NICK	I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
L330419	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Our chance to do what?
L330418	u6158	m410	NICK	Then this is our chance.
L330345	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
L330344	u6158	m410	NICK	Do you see any family resemblance here?
L330326	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, my God.
L330325	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No way.
L330314	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	She's nuts.
L330313	u6158	m410	NICK	She's gutty.
L330667	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
L330666	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
L330631	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
L330630	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Four, counting the one in the chamber.
L330629	u6159	m410	ROLAND	How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
L330577	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
L330576	u6159	m410	ROLAND	"You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, ""why did you go up there to die?""  And he said ""I didn't.  I went up there to live."""
L330575	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	But why?
L330574	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
L330572	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
L330571	u6159	m410	ROLAND	So the truth is more important to you than your life?
L330570	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
L330569	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
L330568	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because it exists.
L330567	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why should they?
L330566	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So that others would know about this place?
L330565	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why did you come here?
L330564	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
L330563	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Feeling a bit blue, are we?
L330562	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
L330561	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What's that?
L330560	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
L330556	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
L330555	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
L330554	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
L330686	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Birdshit?
L330685	u6160	m410	SARAH	These formations.  They're dried --
L330684	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330683	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian.  It's guano.
L330590	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
L330589	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Maybe.  Maybe not.
L330588	u6160	m410	SARAH	You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
L330510	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They're pushing us over the cliff.
L330509	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?!
L330508	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Oh, God.
L330504	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
L330503	u6160	m410	SARAH	They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
L330502	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
L330492	u6160	m410	SARAH	I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
L330491	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you insane?!
L330490	u6160	m410	SARAH	Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
L330487	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
L330486	u6160	m410	SARAH	That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
L330470	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Think fast, Sarah.
L330469	u6160	m410	SARAH	It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
L330468	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Can you set up?
L330393	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John Hammond.
L330392	u6160	m410	SARAH	Funded by whom?
L330391	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
L330342	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm her father.
L330341	u6160	m410	SARAH	Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
L330340	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
L330335	u6160	m410	SARAH	What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
L330334	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
L330318	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
L330317	u6160	m410	SARAH	No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
L330712	u6160	m410	SARAH	Where's Ian?
L330711	u6158	m410	NICK	Where's Kelly?
L330621	u6158	m410	NICK	JUMP!
L330620	u6160	m410	SARAH	WHAT ARE YOU-

L330498	u6158	m410	NICK	"There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One ""no"" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:"
L330479	u6158	m410	NICK	I'm trying!
L330478	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hold it down, Nick!
L330474	u6160	m410	SARAH	We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
L330473	u6158	m410	NICK	Give it more morphine!
L330467	u6160	m410	SARAH	That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
L330466	u6158	m410	NICK	That little black line?
L330385	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
L330384	u6158	m410	NICK	Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
L330351	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
L330350	u6158	m410	NICK	The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
L330328	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, no!

L330292	u6158	m410	NICK	He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
L330291	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian's a very good friend of mine.
L330290	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
L330289	u6160	m410	SARAH	You think this is all a joke?
L330288	u6158	m410	NICK	Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
L330287	u6160	m410	SARAH	Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
L330286	u6158	m410	NICK	Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
L330285	u6160	m410	SARAH	That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
L330284	u6158	m410	NICK	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
L330283	u6160	m410	SARAH	So what's your story, Nick?
L330660	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
L330659	u6160	m410	SARAH	You've got to be kidding.
L330633	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Can the kid walk?
L330632	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ask her.
L330600	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
L330599	u6160	m410	SARAH	We have to send someone to look for him!
L330543	u6160	m410	SARAH	Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
L330542	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
L330541	u6159	m410	ROLAND	None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
L330540	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
L332427	u6174	m412	BILLER	No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
L332426	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	You want to put in chain saws?
L332425	u6174	m412	BILLER	Chain saws.
L332423	u6174	m412	BILLER	Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
L332422	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
L332421	u6174	m412	BILLER	You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
L332420	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Ken, we've been through this...
L332419	u6174	m412	BILLER	Fifty? We need seventy-five.
L332418	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Fifty.
L332417	u6174	m412	BILLER	Really? How much?
L332416	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
L332415	u6174	m412	BILLER	Hello?
L332412	u6174	m412	BILLER	I want to look at the rest of the house.
L332411	u6178	m412	JANET	I really think we should go back...
L332410	u6174	m412	BILLER	There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
L332407	u6174	m412	BILLER	Help me with this.
L332406	u6178	m412	JANET	Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
L332405	u6174	m412	BILLER	Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
L332400	u6174	m412	BILLER	You learn something new every day. Let's go.
L332399	u6178	m412	JANET	I didn't think there were any houses up here...
L332397	u6178	m412	JANET	I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
L332396	u6174	m412	BILLER	You have a map.
L332395	u6178	m412	JANET	I think we're lost.
L332394	u6174	m412	BILLER	Yeah?
L332393	u6178	m412	JANET	Mister Biller?
L332391	u6174	m412	BILLER	Great.
L332390	u6178	m412	JANET	Okay... well... I think it's this way...
L332388	u6174	m412	BILLER	Get rid of them.
L332387	u6178	m412	JANET	Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
L332386	u6174	m412	BILLER	Jesus Christ!
L332385	u6174	m412	BILLER	I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
L332384	u6178	m412	JANET	Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
L332383	u6174	m412	BILLER	Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
L332381	u6174	m412	BILLER	We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
L332380	u6178	m412	JANET	That's not true...
L332379	u6174	m412	BILLER	And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
L332378	u6178	m412	JANET	No, but...
L332377	u6174	m412	BILLER	Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
L332376	u6178	m412	JANET	I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
L332449	u6178	m412	JANET	Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
L332448	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
L332447	u6178	m412	JANET	Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
L332446	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Who's there?
L332445	u6178	m412	JANET	He... he's here...
L332444	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
L332442	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
L332441	u6178	m412	JANET	Other guy?
L332440	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	What about that other guy?
L332439	u6178	m412	JANET	I don't know...
L332438	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Where's Ken? Is he all right?
L332437	u6178	m412	JANET	This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
L332436	u6175	m412	BRUCE'S VOICE	Who is this? What's going on?
L332435	u6178	m412	JANET	Hello?
L332804	u6180	m412	RUBY	Come on.
L332803	u6176	m412	HARDING	Who?
L332802	u6180	m412	RUBY	_Krueger_...
L332801	u6176	m412	HARDING	What happened?
L332791	u6180	m412	RUBY	His camera... it's still recording.
L332790	u6176	m412	HARDING	What?
L332789	u6180	m412	RUBY	It's still on.
L332784	u6176	m412	HARDING	Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
L332783	u6180	m412	RUBY	What's going on?
L332765	u6180	m412	RUBY	Fuck you.
L332720	u6180	m412	RUBY	I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
L332719	u6176	m412	HARDING	Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
L332566	u6176	m412	HARDING	You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
L332565	u6180	m412	RUBY	What?
L332564	u6176	m412	HARDING	And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
L332563	u6180	m412	RUBY	Quite a circus.
L332481	u6176	m412	HARDING	That's my job.
L332480	u6180	m412	RUBY	I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
L332479	u6176	m412	HARDING	I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
L332478	u6180	m412	RUBY	Two.
L332718	u6180	m412	RUBY	Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
L332716	u6180	m412	RUBY	And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
L332715	u6180	m412	RUBY	Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
L332714	u6177	m412	HAYES	Who's chest?
L332713	u6180	m412	RUBY	That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
L332506	u6180	m412	RUBY	He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
L332505	u6177	m412	HAYES	Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
L332502	u6177	m412	HAYES	That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
L332501	u6180	m412	RUBY	A house?
L332500	u6177	m412	HAYES	Compared to this guy... amateur.
L332499	u6180	m412	RUBY	I thought that was Ted Bundy.
L332498	u6177	m412	HAYES	Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
L332497	u6180	m412	RUBY	What are the charges?
L332496	u6177	m412	HAYES	Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
L332495	u6180	m412	RUBY	Three.  Where's my client?
L332539	u6179	m412	KWAN	A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
L332538	u6180	m412	RUBY	Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave.
L332537	u6179	m412	KWAN	This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
L332536	u6180	m412	RUBY	You watch this garbage?
L332533	u6180	m412	RUBY	I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
L332532	u6179	m412	KWAN	You think that's going to work?
L332530	u6180	m412	RUBY	Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
L332529	u6179	m412	KWAN	Because everyone knows he's guilty...
L332528	u6180	m412	RUBY	So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
L332526	u6179	m412	KWAN	Video store?
L332525	u6180	m412	RUBY	Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
L332522	u6180	m412	RUBY	It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
L332521	u6179	m412	KWAN	Sorry.
L332518	u6180	m412	RUBY	I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
L332517	u6179	m412	KWAN	Are you going to plead insanity?
L332942	u6180	m412	RUBY	My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
L332941	u6181	m412	SENA	What happened? Where's Jason?
L332918	u6181	m412	SENA	For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
L332917	u6180	m412	RUBY	Are you all right?
L332911	u6180	m412	RUBY	Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
L332910	u6181	m412	SENA	We're down to seven minutes.
L332886	u6181	m412	SENA	If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
L332885	u6180	m412	RUBY	Ten minutes...
L332884	u6181	m412	SENA	About ten minutes.
L332883	u6180	m412	RUBY	How long will the effect last?
L332882	u6181	m412	SENA	Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
L332881	u6180	m412	RUBY	So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
L332880	u6181	m412	SENA	_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
L332879	u6180	m412	RUBY	What's that?
L332877	u6180	m412	RUBY	Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
L332876	u6181	m412	SENA	And if he's not?
L332875	u6180	m412	RUBY	Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
L332874	u6181	m412	SENA	Think it'll do any good?
L332873	u6180	m412	RUBY	I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
L332872	u6181	m412	SENA	You know how to use one of those?
L332867	u6181	m412	SENA	Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
L332866	u6180	m412	RUBY	I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
L332865	u6181	m412	SENA	Where's he going?
L332858	u6181	m412	SENA	Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
L332857	u6180	m412	RUBY	If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
L332856	u6181	m412	SENA	Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
L332855	u6180	m412	RUBY	So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
L332842	u6181	m412	SENA	Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
L332841	u6180	m412	RUBY	How's that possible?
L332840	u6181	m412	SENA	This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
L332836	u6181	m412	SENA	Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
L332835	u6180	m412	RUBY	What are you doing?
L332816	u6180	m412	RUBY	A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
L332815	u6181	m412	SENA	You saw him?
L332814	u6180	m412	RUBY	It was Krueger, wasn't it?
L332813	u6181	m412	SENA	It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
L332761	u6180	m412	RUBY	I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
L332760	u6181	m412	SENA	You're not going to be there?
L332759	u6180	m412	RUBY	I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
L332758	u6181	m412	SENA	Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
L332756	u6181	m412	SENA	Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
L332755	u6180	m412	RUBY	Not yet.
L332754	u6181	m412	SENA	I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
L332753	u6180	m412	RUBY	So what do we do?
L332752	u6181	m412	SENA	Add it to the list.
L332751	u6180	m412	RUBY	That doesn't make sense.
L332750	u6181	m412	SENA	It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
L332748	u6181	m412	SENA	_It's a second REM pattern_.
L332747	u6180	m412	RUBY	Yeah, what is it?
L332746	u6181	m412	SENA	See this?
L332740	u6181	m412	SENA	Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
L332739	u6180	m412	RUBY	Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
L332738	u6181	m412	SENA	Uh-huh...
L332737	u6180	m412	RUBY	That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
L332736	u6181	m412	SENA	I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
L332735	u6180	m412	RUBY	Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
L332734	u6181	m412	SENA	Fascinating.
L332733	u6180	m412	RUBY	He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
L332732	u6181	m412	SENA	Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
L332731	u6180	m412	RUBY	Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
L332730	u6181	m412	SENA	Me too. I'm drunk.
L332729	u6180	m412	RUBY	I think I'm onto something, Joe.
L332687	u6180	m412	RUBY	He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
L332686	u6181	m412	SENA	There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
L332685	u6181	m412	SENA	I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
L332684	u6180	m412	RUBY	That's open to debate.
L332683	u6181	m412	SENA	Cute waitresses?
L332682	u6180	m412	RUBY	There's a pizza place over on Market.
L332681	u6181	m412	SENA	Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
L332675	u6181	m412	SENA	We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
L332674	u6180	m412	RUBY	How long will he need to be asleep?
L332671	u6180	m412	RUBY	Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
L332670	u6181	m412	SENA	Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
L332669	u6180	m412	RUBY	How do we prove it?
L332668	u6181	m412	SENA	Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
L332667	u6180	m412	RUBY	If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
L332666	u6181	m412	SENA	Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
L332665	u6180	m412	RUBY	So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
L332664	u6181	m412	SENA	It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
L332663	u6180	m412	RUBY	Insomnolesence...
L332662	u6181	m412	SENA	It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
L332661	u6180	m412	RUBY	That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
L332660	u6181	m412	SENA	The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
L332659	u6181	m412	SENA	Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
L332658	u6180	m412	RUBY	Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
L332655	u6181	m412	SENA	You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
L332654	u6180	m412	RUBY	Oh?
L332653	u6181	m412	SENA	No. You've told me all I need to know.
L332652	u6180	m412	RUBY	What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
L332651	u6181	m412	SENA	That didn't sound very convincing.
L332650	u6180	m412	RUBY	"I don't ""rationalize"" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all."
L332649	u6181	m412	SENA	Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
L332647	u6180	m412	RUBY	My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
L332646	u6181	m412	SENA	So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
L332645	u6180	m412	RUBY	Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
L332644	u6181	m412	SENA	None of that's true?
L332642	u6181	m412	SENA	I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
L332641	u6180	m412	RUBY	So?
L332640	u6181	m412	SENA	I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
L332639	u6180	m412	RUBY	Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
L332638	u6181	m412	SENA	No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
L332637	u6180	m412	RUBY	This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
L332636	u6181	m412	SENA	Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
L332582	u6180	m412	RUBY	This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
L332581	u6181	m412	SENA	Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
L332580	u6180	m412	RUBY	This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
L332579	u6181	m412	SENA	One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
L332578	u6180	m412	RUBY	Oh?
L332575	u6181	m412	SENA	I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
L332574	u6180	m412	RUBY	He wets the bed?
L332573	u6181	m412	SENA	Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
L332572	u6180	m412	RUBY	Doesnit sleep?
L332571	u6181	m412	SENA	No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
L332570	u6180	m412	RUBY	Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
L332569	u6181	m412	SENA	He's fucking nuts.
L332568	u6180	m412	RUBY	Well?
L340828	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
L340827	u6257	m418	JACK	We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
L340826	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
L340735	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	No.  Do you?
L340734	u6257	m418	JACK	He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
L340328	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Oh, yes.
L340327	u6257	m418	JACK	You killed him.
L340326	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Oh yes.  I killed him.
L340325	u6257	m418	JACK	Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
L340825	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Go ahead.
L340824	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	I'll sue you.
L340748	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
L340747	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
L340746	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
L340741	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
L340740	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
L340737	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
L340736	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
L340731	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
L340730	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
L340729	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	I haven't broken any laws.
L340330	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
L340329	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
L340320	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
L340319	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
L340318	u6254	m418	BICKERMAN	Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
L340765	u6256	m418	HECTOR	<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
L340764	u6255	m418	GARE	Go!!!
L340760	u6255	m418	GARE	Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
L340759	u6256	m418	HECTOR	<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
L340758	u6255	m418	GARE	I might get a shot.
L340745	u6256	m418	HECTOR	He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
L340744	u6255	m418	GARE	<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
L340743	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I need to see his habitat.
L340742	u6255	m418	GARE	C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
L340704	u6255	m418	GARE	<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
L340703	u6256	m418	HECTOR	'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
L340702	u6255	m418	GARE	Why are we landing?
L340701	u6256	m418	HECTOR	It happens when I land.
L340700	u6255	m418	GARE	It seems like we're getting lower.
L340449	u6256	m418	HECTOR	And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
L340448	u6255	m418	GARE	Thank you.
L340447	u6256	m418	HECTOR	You're a beautiful woman.
L340902	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I don't know!
L340901	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Where is he?!
L340899	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
L340898	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
L340897	u6256	m418	HECTOR	No!
L340806	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
L340805	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Gee, that would really disappoint me.
L340779	u6256	m418	HECTOR	So profound and fat.
L340778	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
L340777	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Then do it!!
L340776	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I can arrest you!!
L340683	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Raincheck.
L340682	u6256	m418	HECTOR	That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
L340681	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
L340680	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
L340679	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
L340678	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
L340666	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	It came from across the lake.
L340665	u6256	m418	HECTOR	What's that?
L340621	u6256	m418	HECTOR	<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
L340620	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
L340619	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
L340613	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
L340612	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Asia?  How... how could he get here?
L340604	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
L340603	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Promise you won't kill me, first.
L340581	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
L340580	u6256	m418	HECTOR	This is a setback.
L340577	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
L340576	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	His head was just... bitten off.
L340575	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
L340574	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Yup.
L340573	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Was he a good man?
L340527	u6256	m418	HECTOR	No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
L340526	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
L340518	u6256	m418	HECTOR	What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
L340517	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Is this a trick?
L340516	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
L340515	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
L340511	u6256	m418	HECTOR	No crocodile has ever--
L340510	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	"That ""Walt"" guy got hit underwater--"
L340509	u6256	m418	HECTOR	They don't really attack underwater and--
L340508	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
L340490	u6256	m418	HECTOR	This could end up saving your life,--
L340489	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I coulda shot you, you--
L340488	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
L340487	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	A spring trap!
L340486	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I'm laying a spring trap!
L340485	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You're crawling around like a--
L340484	u6256	m418	HECTOR	What are <u>you</u> doing?!
L340483	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	What the hell are you doing?!!
L340482	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Jesus Christ!!
L340461	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
L340460	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I do <u>not</u> like you.
L340459	u6256	m418	HECTOR	And you like me.
L340458	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
L340457	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	No!!  Out!
L340456	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
L340455	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
L340454	u6256	m418	HECTOR	They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
L340453	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
L340452	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Cocktail?
L340451	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	We are here on official business.
L340437	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
L340436	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Keystone what?
L340435	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
L340434	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	We'd only just met.
L340409	u6256	m418	HECTOR	If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
L340408	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Around here.  Yeah.
L340405	u6256	m418	HECTOR	They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
L340404	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	And what would he do come winter?
L340403	u6256	m418	HECTOR	They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
L340402	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
L340395	u6256	m418	HECTOR	C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
L340394	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Mr. Cyr!
L340393	u6256	m418	HECTOR	They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
L340388	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
L340387	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
L340386	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I'll need any and all topographic studies.
L340385	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
L340937	u6257	m418	JACK	Just those two.
L340936	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
L340935	u6257	m418	JACK	She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
L340934	u6256	m418	HECTOR	You talk to Bickerman?
L340933	u6257	m418	JACK	You take care.
L340912	u6257	m418	JACK	Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
L340911	u6256	m418	HECTOR	<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
L340884	u6257	m418	JACK	Tranq guns down, rifles up!
L340883	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Where is he?
L340867	u6257	m418	JACK	"You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling ""go"" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?"
L340866	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Thank you, Jack.
L340865	u6257	m418	JACK	Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
L340854	u6257	m418	JACK	Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
L340853	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
L340852	u6257	m418	JACK	Can you confirm visually or just radar?
L340851	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
L340850	u6257	m418	JACK	Where?  Where?
L340848	u6257	m418	JACK	You do?
L340847	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I got something on the screen.
L340838	u6257	m418	JACK	We're ready.
L340837	u6256	m418	HECTOR	You ready on shore?
L340836	u6257	m418	JACK	The more he thrashes, the better.
L340835	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Right.
L340834	u6257	m418	JACK	Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
L340823	u6256	m418	HECTOR	That's actually the easy part.
L340822	u6257	m418	JACK	And again.  How would you get him on land?
L340818	u6256	m418	HECTOR	We both know what they'll do.
L340817	u6257	m418	JACK	So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
L340816	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
L340815	u6257	m418	JACK	No way.
L340810	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
L340809	u6257	m418	JACK	<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
L340808	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
L340807	u6257	m418	JACK	Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
L340773	u6257	m418	JACK	'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
L340772	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
L340768	u6257	m418	JACK	Hey!!
L340767	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Bastard bit my chopper.
L340766	u6257	m418	JACK	This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
L340629	u6257	m418	JACK	Get the gun.
L340628	u6256	m418	HECTOR	"He never said ""go""."
L340627	u6257	m418	JACK	Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
L340626	u6256	m418	HECTOR	"At school they'd always say ""go"" first."
L340930	u6256	m418	HECTOR	And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
L340929	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yeah.  Thanks to you.
L340928	u6256	m418	HECTOR	He's gonna live?
L340919	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
L340918	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Guess I finally got bit.
L340917	u6258	m418	KELLY	You're gonna be okay.
L340914	u6258	m418	KELLY	You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
L340913	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I'm okay.
L340814	u6256	m418	HECTOR	We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
L340813	u6258	m418	KELLY	And how would we neutralize him?
L340804	u6256	m418	HECTOR	They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
L340803	u6258	m418	KELLY	They could try to tranq him on land.
L340802	u6256	m418	HECTOR	They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
L340796	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Could we have intercourse?
L340795	u6258	m418	KELLY	What?
L340794	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
L340793	u6258	m418	KELLY	Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
L340792	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Eh.  Fuck it.
L340791	u6258	m418	KELLY	No.
L340790	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
L340789	u6258	m418	KELLY	Oh, bullshit.
L340788	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
L340787	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
L340786	u6256	m418	HECTOR	With crocodiles... everything's even.
L340785	u6256	m418	HECTOR	<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
L340784	u6258	m418	KELLY	Excuse me?
L340783	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Nothing's real.
L340782	u6258	m418	KELLY	Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
L340781	u6256	m418	HECTOR	You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
L340780	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
L340775	u6256	m418	HECTOR	I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
L340774	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>Jack</u>!
L340611	u6258	m418	KELLY	Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
L340610	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Are you sure?
L340609	u6258	m418	KELLY	He was an Indo-pacific.
L340525	u6256	m418	HECTOR	As if.  Will you miss me?
L340524	u6258	m418	KELLY	What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
L340523	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
L340514	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm just saying last resort.
L340513	u6256	m418	HECTOR	And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
L340512	u6258	m418	KELLY	You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
L340425	u6258	m418	KELLY	U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
L340424	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Such the flirt.
L340421	u6256	m418	HECTOR	What's going on?
L340420	u6258	m418	KELLY	None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
L340412	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>Hector</u>.
L340411	u6256	m418	HECTOR	'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
L340410	u6258	m418	KELLY	But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
L340401	u6256	m418	HECTOR	Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
L340400	u6258	m418	KELLY	I never had sex with you!
L340399	u6256	m418	HECTOR	If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
L340397	u6256	m418	HECTOR	That hurt my feelings.
L340396	u6258	m418	KELLY	Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
L340969	u6258	m418	KELLY	Good thinking.
L340968	u6257	m418	JACK	That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
L340967	u6258	m418	KELLY	Probably not.
L340966	u6257	m418	JACK	Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
L340965	u6258	m418	KELLY	You think?
L340964	u6257	m418	JACK	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
L340963	u6258	m418	KELLY	No.
L340962	u6257	m418	JACK	Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
L340961	u6258	m418	KELLY	Different worlds, Jack.
L340959	u6258	m418	KELLY	Likewise.
L340958	u6257	m418	JACK	It was... something meeting you.
L340957	u6258	m418	KELLY	But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
L340956	u6257	m418	JACK	Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
L340955	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yeah.
L340954	u6257	m418	JACK	If I'm ever in New York...
L340952	u6258	m418	KELLY	No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
L340951	u6257	m418	JACK	You sure?  I don't mind...
L340948	u6257	m418	JACK	You wanna ride in my truck?
L340947	u6258	m418	KELLY	Well...
L340916	u6258	m418	KELLY	He heeds a tourniquet.
L340915	u6257	m418	JACK	Get him onto shore.
L340910	u6257	m418	JACK	I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
L340909	u6258	m418	KELLY	He's through fighting.  Look at him.
L340882	u6257	m418	JACK	Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
L340881	u6258	m418	KELLY	We gotta get to Hector!!
L340878	u6257	m418	JACK	Take him.
L340877	u6258	m418	KELLY	Hector!!
L340874	u6257	m418	JACK	Keep firing!
L340873	u6258	m418	KELLY	Watch out!!
L340861	u6257	m418	JACK	You wouldn't?
L340860	u6258	m418	KELLY	He's mooing.
L340845	u6257	m418	JACK	Hector.
L340844	u6258	m418	KELLY	He's floating.  Take it home.
L340843	u6257	m418	JACK	He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
L340842	u6257	m418	JACK	He looks like a giant tea bag.
L340841	u6258	m418	KELLY	He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
L340840	u6257	m418	JACK	It can't work.
L340831	u6257	m418	JACK	We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
L340830	u6258	m418	KELLY	Well...
L340829	u6257	m418	JACK	Are we crazy?
L340800	u6258	m418	KELLY	Good idea.
L340799	u6257	m418	JACK	We might as well pack.
L340798	u6258	m418	KELLY	Okay.
L340797	u6257	m418	JACK	Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
L340771	u6257	m418	JACK	<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
L340770	u6258	m418	KELLY	Alright, Jack!
L340769	u6257	m418	JACK	You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
L340724	u6257	m418	JACK	Look.
L340723	u6258	m418	KELLY	What?
L340716	u6257	m418	JACK	<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
L340715	u6258	m418	KELLY	You calm down!
L340714	u6257	m418	JACK	Calm down.
L340713	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
L340712	u6257	m418	JACK	Really--
L340711	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
L340710	u6257	m418	JACK	Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
L340709	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
L340708	u6257	m418	JACK	You're mushing it a little around the--
L340707	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm not mushing it.
L340706	u6257	m418	JACK	Maybe.  Don't mush it.
L340705	u6258	m418	KELLY	Thing we can lift it?
L340695	u6257	m418	JACK	I heard something.
L340694	u6258	m418	KELLY	What?
L340693	u6257	m418	JACK	Ssssh!
L340692	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
L340686	u6257	m418	JACK	We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
L340685	u6258	m418	KELLY	We seem to say goodnight a lot.
L340684	u6257	m418	JACK	Well.  Goodnight.
L340655	u6258	m418	KELLY	Night.
L340654	u6257	m418	JACK	Thanks for the... bandaid.
L340652	u6258	m418	KELLY	Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
L340651	u6257	m418	JACK	That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
L340649	u6258	m418	KELLY	What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
L340648	u6257	m418	JACK	You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
L340647	u6257	m418	JACK	Thank you.
L340646	u6258	m418	KELLY	Keep it dry.  No swimming.
L340645	u6257	m418	JACK	No thanks.
L340644	u6258	m418	KELLY	Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
L340643	u6257	m418	JACK	Who taught you be be a nurse?
L340642	u6258	m418	KELLY	Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
L340641	u6257	m418	JACK	<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
L340637	u6258	m418	KELLY	It's okay.
L340636	u6257	m418	JACK	Sorry.
L340635	u6257	m418	JACK	Let's get away from the shore.
L340634	u6258	m418	KELLY	I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
L340633	u6257	m418	JACK	I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
L340632	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
L340631	u6257	m418	JACK	Like little children.  You okay?
L340618	u6257	m418	JACK	But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
L340617	u6258	m418	KELLY	Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
L340596	u6257	m418	JACK	Just forget it.
L340595	u6258	m418	KELLY	A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
L340594	u6257	m418	JACK	I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
L340593	u6258	m418	KELLY	You <u>did</u>, you--
L340592	u6257	m418	JACK	I didn't say it like that.
L340591	u6258	m418	KELLY	"Nice?  Nice would be ""you look pretty,"" nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good."
L340590	u6257	m418	JACK	Forgive me for trying to be nice.
L340589	u6258	m418	KELLY	Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
L340588	u6257	m418	JACK	I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
L340587	u6258	m418	KELLY	What are you talking about?
L340586	u6257	m418	JACK	When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
L340585	u6258	m418	KELLY	Excuse me?
L340584	u6257	m418	JACK	You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
L340583	u6257	m418	JACK	I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
L340582	u6258	m418	KELLY	Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
L340569	u6258	m418	KELLY	Um... y'know...  Yeah.
L340568	u6257	m418	JACK	<u>Are</u> you okay?
L340567	u6257	m418	JACK	Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
L340566	u6258	m418	KELLY	That's probably good.
L340565	u6257	m418	JACK	No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
L340564	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
L340563	u6257	m418	JACK	You okay?  Kelly?
L340522	u6258	m418	KELLY	Good luck.
L340521	u6257	m418	JACK	Good.  See ya soon.
L340520	u6258	m418	KELLY	They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
L340500	u6258	m418	KELLY	In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
L340499	u6257	m418	JACK	He thinks they're what?
L340481	u6257	m418	JACK	'Night.
L340480	u6258	m418	KELLY	Good.
L340479	u6257	m418	JACK	Okay.  We're up at six.
L340477	u6257	m418	JACK	I'm sorry but you're...
L340476	u6258	m418	KELLY	That was an awful thing to say to me.
L340473	u6258	m418	KELLY	I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
L340472	u6257	m418	JACK	You flew up here because your boss--
L340471	u6258	m418	KELLY	I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
L340470	u6257	m418	JACK	It's too dangerous for--
L340469	u6258	m418	KELLY	I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
L340468	u6257	m418	JACK	Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
L340467	u6258	m418	KELLY	I beg your pardon?
L340466	u6257	m418	JACK	Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
L340465	u6258	m418	KELLY	Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
L340464	u6257	m418	JACK	What are you doing?
L340444	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'd be able to see something.
L340443	u6257	m418	JACK	He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
L340441	u6258	m418	KELLY	Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
L340440	u6257	m418	JACK	If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
L340439	u6258	m418	KELLY	Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
L340438	u6257	m418	JACK	Baby crocs?
L340428	u6257	m418	JACK	Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
L340427	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>Something's</u> in that water.
L340426	u6257	m418	JACK	Same thing from Fish And Game.
L340381	u6258	m418	KELLY	There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
L340380	u6257	m418	JACK	In Maine?
L340377	u6258	m418	KELLY	Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
L340376	u6257	m418	JACK	Who?
L340375	u6258	m418	KELLY	If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
L340374	u6257	m418	JACK	What?
L340373	u6258	m418	KELLY	Oh my God.
L340372	u6258	m418	KELLY	I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
L340371	u6257	m418	JACK	Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
L340370	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm not making it up.
L340366	u6257	m418	JACK	You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
L340365	u6258	m418	KELLY	So I don't like tents, why--
L340364	u6257	m418	JACK	And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
L340363	u6258	m418	KELLY	How would <u>you</u> know, what--
L340362	u6257	m418	JACK	The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
L340361	u6258	m418	KELLY	I <u>told</u> you.
L340360	u6257	m418	JACK	Why are you here?  Really.
L340359	u6258	m418	KELLY	I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
L340358	u6257	m418	JACK	Never been to Maine before?
L340357	u6258	m418	KELLY	It really is beautiful, isn't it?
L340356	u6257	m418	JACK	Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
L340355	u6258	m418	KELLY	And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
L340354	u6257	m418	JACK	Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
L340353	u6258	m418	KELLY	How big do the bears get?
L340312	u6257	m418	JACK	Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
L340311	u6258	m418	KELLY	Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
L340307	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
L340306	u6257	m418	JACK	Did you make anything of the tooth?
L340305	u6258	m418	KELLY	Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
L340304	u6257	m418	JACK	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
L340303	u6258	m418	KELLY	Kelly Scott.
L340944	u6257	m418	JACK	You too.
L340943	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Thanks for your help.
L340921	u6257	m418	JACK	Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
L340920	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	He's done.  He's dying.
L340888	u6257	m418	JACK	Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
L340887	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I'll take it!
L340886	u6257	m418	JACK	If you get a safe shot...
L340880	u6257	m418	JACK	Where is he?!
L340879	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
L340820	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Other than to eat us?
L340819	u6257	m418	JACK	Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
L340722	u6257	m418	JACK	<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
L340721	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Now I'm gonna puke.
L340691	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	So does he.
L340690	u6257	m418	JACK	They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
L340689	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	We shouldn't even really be doing this.
L340688	u6257	m418	JACK	Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
L340668	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Obviously I was wrong!
L340667	u6257	m418	JACK	You said nobody came in here!
L340616	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
L340615	u6257	m418	JACK	Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
L340417	u6257	m418	JACK	They look like they're jumping.
L340416	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
L340415	u6257	m418	JACK	Are they feeding?
L340414	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	White perch.
L340413	u6257	m418	JACK	What's that?
L340334	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I'll call the coroner.
L340333	u6257	m418	JACK	You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
L340332	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Half mile up, there's a clearing.
L340310	u6257	m418	JACK	Let's go.
L340309	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I'm ready when you are.
L340302	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
L340301	u6257	m418	JACK	We set?
L340946	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I guess.
L340945	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
L340906	u6258	m418	KELLY	Wait.
L340905	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Should I?
L340894	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I don't know.  Back the truck--
L340893	u6258	m418	KELLY	Did you get him?
L340864	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	That it's about to go wrong.
L340863	u6258	m418	KELLY	Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
L340862	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	They're coming right in.
L340857	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	She's worried about the cow now.
L340856	u6258	m418	KELLY	If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
L340727	u6258	m418	KELLY	Look ten feet into the water.
L340726	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	What?
L340725	u6258	m418	KELLY	What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
L340697	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Look.
L340696	u6258	m418	KELLY	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
L340625	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	He said he knew Karate!
L340624	u6258	m418	KELLY	Hank!
L340602	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
L340601	u6258	m418	KELLY	Are you okay?
L340600	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Yes.
L340599	u6258	m418	KELLY	Hank?
L340557	u6258	m418	KELLY	I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
L340556	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Are you alright?
L340546	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
L340545	u6258	m418	KELLY	What was that?
L340544	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>That</u> was a bust.
L340543	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
L340540	u6258	m418	KELLY	Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
L340539	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
L340538	u6258	m418	KELLY	What is this?
L340537	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You think Jack's handsome?
L340536	u6258	m418	KELLY	Well Hector's a giant cracker.
L340535	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Hector thinks you like him.
L340534	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
L340533	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You like Jack?
L340532	u6258	m418	KELLY	He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
L340531	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
L340530	u6258	m418	KELLY	He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
L340529	u6258	m418	KELLY	I asked you to be nice to him.
L340528	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
L340504	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm sorry.
L340503	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
L340502	u6258	m418	KELLY	It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
L340501	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
L340496	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	<u>Apologize</u>?
L340495	u6258	m418	KELLY	You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
L340423	u6258	m418	KELLY	Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
L340422	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	They don't believe her.
L340379	u6258	m418	KELLY	Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
L340378	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	With what?
L340348	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I just let go of it.
L340347	u6258	m418	KELLY	You threw it at me!!
L340346	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Hey!!
L340345	u6258	m418	KELLY	It looks like a branch.
L340344	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I thought I saw...
L340343	u6258	m418	KELLY	What?
L340342	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	What the hell?
L340341	u6258	m418	KELLY	"Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard ""tents"", will there be toilets?"
L340340	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
L340339	u6258	m418	KELLY	We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
L340338	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
L340337	u6258	m418	KELLY	Gee.
L340336	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
L340335	u6258	m418	KELLY	What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
L340324	u6258	m418	KELLY	Sheriff.
L340323	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Was he swallowed?
L340322	u6258	m418	KELLY	We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
L340299	u6258	m418	KELLY	It's just that--
L340298	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	You're sort of a rude person.
L340297	u6258	m418	KELLY	And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
L340296	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
L340295	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
L340294	u6258	m418	KELLY	Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
L340293	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I got nothing against--
L340292	u6258	m418	KELLY	You have a thing against museums?
L340291	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
L340290	u6258	m418	KELLY	What?
L340289	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	<u>We</u>?
L340288	u6258	m418	KELLY	What kind of backup do we have?
L340287	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Not yet.
L340286	u6258	m418	KELLY	You talk to the married couple?
L340285	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
L340284	u6258	m418	KELLY	Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
L340283	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Yes.
L340282	u6258	m418	KELLY	And this is how he came to the boat?
L340281	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Seconds.  Three, four.
L340280	u6258	m418	KELLY	This... how long did this attack go on for?
L340277	u6258	m418	KELLY	I can look at dead things.
L340276	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	This is a little different.
L340275	u6258	m418	KELLY	Well.  At wakes.
L340274	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
L340273	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm fine, thank you.
L340272	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	I wouldn't.
L340268	u6258	m418	KELLY	Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
L340267	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
L340266	u6258	m418	KELLY	Is the dead guy in there?
L340265	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	Yes.
L340264	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
L340263	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
L340262	u6258	m418	KELLY	And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
L340261	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
L340260	u6258	m418	KELLY	Did he say anything?
L340259	u6259	m418	KEOUGH	He just came up screaming.
L340258	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
L340257	u6260	m418	KEVIN	<u>Kelly</u>--
L340256	u6258	m418	KELLY	I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
L340255	u6260	m418	KEVIN	It has nothing to do with--
L340254	u6258	m418	KELLY	This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
L340253	u6260	m418	KEVIN	Well on this one I'd like you to be.
L340252	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm not even a field person.
L340251	u6260	m418	KEVIN	Part of our research--
L340250	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
L340249	u6260	m418	KEVIN	Kelly--
L340248	u6258	m418	KELLY	Are you on drugs?
L340247	u6260	m418	KEVIN	I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
L340246	u6258	m418	KELLY	This is what we do?
L340245	u6260	m418	KEVIN	I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
L340244	u6258	m418	KELLY	Sorry?
L340243	u6260	m418	KEVIN	I want you to go there.
L340242	u6258	m418	KELLY	Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
L340241	u6260	m418	KEVIN	A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
L340240	u6258	m418	KELLY	A tooth?
L340239	u6260	m418	KEVIN	This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
L340238	u6258	m418	KELLY	Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
L340237	u6260	m418	KEVIN	Hey.
L340208	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yes, well...  famished.
L340207	u6260	m418	KEVIN	It's ten after nine.
L340206	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
L340205	u6260	m418	KEVIN	A jerk.
L340204	u6258	m418	KELLY	Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
L340203	u6260	m418	KEVIN	Else.
L340202	u6258	m418	KELLY	Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
L340201	u6260	m418	KEVIN	The somebody else part?
L340200	u6258	m418	KELLY	Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
L340199	u6260	m418	KEVIN	I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
L340198	u6258	m418	KELLY	"I was working for you when ""us"" started, what's--"
L340197	u6260	m418	KEVIN	"You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, ""us""..."
L340196	u6258	m418	KELLY	That's not what you came to say.
L340195	u6258	m418	KELLY	Me too.
L340194	u6260	m418	KEVIN	I had a great time last night. Again.
L340193	u6258	m418	KELLY	Absolutely.
L340192	u6260	m418	KEVIN	Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
L340191	u6258	m418	KELLY	Kevin, hey.
L340190	u6260	m418	KEVIN	Kelly.
L340234	u6258	m418	KELLY	I really... I should get back.
L340233	u6261	m418	OKUBO	Shitbutt?
L340232	u6258	m418	KELLY	Myra.
L340231	u6261	m418	OKUBO	Liar?
L340230	u6258	m418	KELLY	No.
L340229	u6261	m418	OKUBO	Backstabber?
L340228	u6258	m418	KELLY	I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
L340227	u6261	m418	OKUBO	Kelly--
L340226	u6258	m418	KELLY	You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
L340225	u6261	m418	OKUBO	It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
L340224	u6258	m418	KELLY	You and Kevin.
L340223	u6261	m418	OKUBO	It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
L340222	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>You</u>?
L340221	u6261	m418	OKUBO	It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
L340220	u6258	m418	KELLY	<u>You</u>?
L340219	u6261	m418	OKUBO	Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
L340218	u6258	m418	KELLY	Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
L340217	u6261	m418	OKUBO	Kevin told me you were upset.
L340216	u6258	m418	KELLY	I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
L340215	u6261	m418	OKUBO	Wild guess.
L340214	u6258	m418	KELLY	Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
L340213	u6261	m418	OKUBO	I <u>tapped</u> you.
L340212	u6258	m418	KELLY	What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
L347669	u6289	m421	BECK	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
L347668	u6293	m421	DOC	Be careful with it.

L347590	u6293	m421	DOC	Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
L347589	u6289	m421	BECK	But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
L347588	u6293	m421	DOC	Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
L347587	u6293	m421	DOC	It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
L347586	u6289	m421	BECK	Not exactly a big ocean country.

L347584	u6289	m421	BECK	Was there such a thing?
L347583	u6293	m421	DOC	No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...

L347484	u6289	m421	BECK	Yeah...right...
L347483	u6293	m421	DOC	It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
L347482	u6289	m421	BECK	Why Sixpack?
L347481	u6293	m421	DOC	And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...

L347389	u6289	m421	BECK	What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
L347388	u6293	m421	DOC	These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
L347387	u6289	m421	BECK	What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
L347382	u6289	m421	BECK	Be my guest.

L347641	u6294	m421	JONES	He did.
L347640	u6289	m421	BECK	No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?

L347421	u6297	m421	WILLIE	After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
L347420	u6289	m421	BECK	That was a loud one wasn't it?
L347342	u6289	m421	BECK	Why can't we pick up his signal?
L347341	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Sixpack?
L347323	u6297	m421	WILLIE	You screw around like that again and--

L347460	u6291	m421	COBB	No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
L347459	u6289	m421	BECK	Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
L347458	u6291	m421	COBB	Excuse me, sir...
L347405	u6289	m421	BECK	All right...
L347404	u6291	m421	COBB	...I'd really have to show it to you.
L347403	u6289	m421	BECK	What's wrong with it?
L347402	u6291	m421	COBB	Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
L347401	u6289	m421	BECK	Something wrong, Cobb?
L347229	u6289	m421	BECK	You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
L347228	u6291	m421	COBB	What about our quota?
L347188	u6289	m421	BECK	He's not at his station.
L347187	u6291	m421	COBB	Where's Doc?!

L347514	u6289	m421	BECK	Do it.
L347513	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
L347512	u6289	m421	BECK	I'm not anxious to find out, either.

L347509	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.

L355326	u6361	m424	BILLY	I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
L355230	u6361	m424	BILLY	I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.

L355223	u6367	m424	HARRY	They go together.
L355222	u6361	m424	BILLY	I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
L354927	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	That's so cool.

L354995	u6370	m424	MILLER	About?
L354994	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
L354993	u6370	m424	MILLER	"What do you mean, ""all of us?"""
L354992	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.

L354988	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	He's a priest?
L354987	u6370	m424	MILLER	I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
L354986	u6370	m424	MILLER	I know him.  I saw him.
L354985	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?

L355531	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
L355530	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
L355529	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Why did you wait so long?
L355528	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.

L355636	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
L355635	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You can't.
L355634	u6367	m424	HARRY	I've got to help him.
L355623	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hang on!
L355622	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh God!
L355435	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's all right.  It's not hurting...
L355434	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry?
L355430	u6367	m424	HARRY	Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
L355429	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Are you all right?
L355418	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's okay.
L355417	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What was that?
L355416	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
L355415	u6367	m424	HARRY	Quaid and Jennifer--
L355414	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.
L355413	u6367	m424	HARRY	And they all came...
L355412	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
L355411	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
L355410	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm sure.  He's dead.
L355409	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Are you sure?
L355408	u6367	m424	HARRY	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
L355407	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was so afraid.
L355406	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nothing you don't want.
L355405	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Nothing?
L355404	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nothing's going to happen to you.
L355403	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm here, aren't I?
L355402	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
L355401	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's okay.
L355399	u6367	m424	HARRY	He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
L355398	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
L355397	u6367	m424	HARRY	What then?
L355396	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I wasn't.
L355395	u6367	m424	HARRY	You said you weren't with him for love.
L355394	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No.
L355393	u6367	m424	HARRY	Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
L355392	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I told you --
L355391	u6367	m424	HARRY	So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
L355390	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Some or it.
L355389	u6367	m424	HARRY	He taught all this to Swann?
L355388	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
L355387	u6367	m424	HARRY	Stuff?
L355386	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
L355385	u6367	m424	HARRY	He was the real thing, right?
L355384	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	It was more than that, I think.
L355383	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
L355382	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why don't you tell me the truth?
L355381	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh Christ.
L355380	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
L355379	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What did you find?
L355378	u6367	m424	HARRY	I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
L355377	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
L355253	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  You do that.
L355252	u6367	m424	HARRY	Okay.  I'll keep digging.
L355251	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
L355250	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Jennifer Desiderio?
L355249	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
L355248	u6367	m424	HARRY	Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
L355247	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	That's my business. Harry.
L355246	u6367	m424	HARRY	So why did you marry him?
L355245	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't marry him for love.
L355244	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He... didn't have me..  I told you-
L355243	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why?  Because he had you?
L355242	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	They were jealous of him.
L355241	u6367	m424	HARRY	I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
L355240	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	How did it go today?
L355165	u6367	m424	HARRY	Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
L355164	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
L355163	u6367	m424	HARRY	I can be very persuasive.
L355162	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	They won't tell you anything.
L355161	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
L355160	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I don't know where you'd start.
L355159	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
L355158	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
L355157	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are they treating you okay?
L355120	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You haven't seen anything yet.
L355119	u6367	m424	HARRY	He's good.
L355090	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sure.
L355089	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
L355088	u6367	m424	HARRY	Do you?
L355087	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
L355086	u6367	m424	HARRY	When do you want me to start?
L355085	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
L355084	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm no bodyguard.
L355083	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry.
L355082	u6367	m424	HARRY	Harry.
L355081	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
L355080	u6367	m424	HARRY	Where do I sign?
L355079	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
L355078	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sorry.  You asked.
L355077	u6367	m424	HARRY	He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
L355076	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You don't believe me.
L355075	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
L355074	u6367	m424	HARRY	But obviously you still care what happens to him.
L355073	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
L355072	u6367	m424	HARRY	Does that mean...?
L355071	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
L355070	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you don't ask questions?
L355069	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He's a secretive man.
L355068	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why not?
L355067	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
L355066	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's the connection?
L355065	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I think we make our own futures.
L355064	u6367	m424	HARRY	You don't?
L355063	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
L355062	u6367	m424	HARRY	Did your husband know Quaid?
L355061	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
L355451	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
L355450	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What about me?
L355321	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I left three messages already.
L355320	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
L355319	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
L355318	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No word from D'Amour?
L355317	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
L355021	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You saw this?
L355020	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Good.  There.  Yes?
L355019	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Valentin?
L355017	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.  I'm not going near him.
L355016	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
L355015	u6373	m424	SWANN	I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
L355014	u6373	m424	SWANN	I just saw him.
L355013	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh God.
L355012	u6373	m424	SWANN	Somebody killed him.
L355011	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Sure.
L355010	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
L355009	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	... they believe you.
L355008	u6373	m424	SWANN	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
L355007	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Bad show last night?
L355156	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.  Not yet...
L355155	u6366	m424	EDDISON	For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
L355154	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you finished with me?
L355153	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Another fucking magician. Jesus.
L355152	u6367	m424	HARRY	--vanished.
L355151	u6366	m424	EDDISON	And this Butterfield guy--
L354983	u6366	m424	EDDISON	After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
L354982	u6367	m424	HARRY	He got up and walked.
L354981	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Where the fuck is he?
L354980	u6366	m424	EDDISON	New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
L354979	u6367	m424	HARRY	I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
L354978	u6366	m424	EDDISON	What makes you so sure?
L354977	u6367	m424	HARRY	Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
L354976	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
L354975	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
L354974	u6366	m424	EDDISON	What were you doing up there?
L355220	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Fuck you.
L355219	u6367	m424	HARRY	Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
L355217	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
L355216	u6367	m424	HARRY	With what?
L355215	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
L355214	u6367	m424	HARRY	Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
L355213	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
L355212	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'd like to hear them.
L355211	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Oh, I've got plenty.
L355210	u6367	m424	HARRY	You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
L355209	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	If he was so good why's he so dead?
L355208	u6367	m424	HARRY	I heard he was the best.
L355207	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	They weren't worth a damn.
L355206	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Swann's miracles?
L355205	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
L355204	u6367	m424	HARRY	So could you walk on water?
L355203	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
L355202	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
L355201	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Trickery and divinity.
L355200	u6367	m424	HARRY	Heaven and Hell?
L355199	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
L355198	u6367	m424	HARRY	You believe that?
L355566	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
L355565	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about?
L355564	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm sorry, D'Amour...
L355563	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
L355562	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Don't bother.
L355561	u6367	m424	HARRY	We've got to get you to a hospital.
L355560	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Him too.
L355554	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Help me.
L355553	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shit...
L355552	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	D'Amour --
L355449	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
L355448	u6367	m424	HARRY	I want to see Swann face to face.
L355447	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
L355446	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
L355445	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
L355444	u6367	m424	HARRY	Was that Swann's idea?
L355443	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I tried to pay you off.
L355442	u6367	m424	HARRY	And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
L355441	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.
L355440	u6367	m424	HARRY	You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
L355439	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.
L355438	u6367	m424	HARRY	You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
L355433	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355432	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you satisfied now?
L355375	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shut up!
L355374	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Leave her alone --
L355372	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You want more money, is that it?
L355371	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah, I know.
L355370	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I can't let you in.
L355315	u6367	m424	HARRY	When will she be in?
L355314	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm afraid she's not in.
L355313	u6367	m424	HARRY	I want to speak to Dorothea.
L355271	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355270	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
L355269	u6367	m424	HARRY	I like to know why things happen.
L355268	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	What for?  You need to stay busy?
L355267	u6367	m424	HARRY	Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
L355266	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.  It's regrettable
L355265	u6367	m424	HARRY	Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
L355264	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
L355263	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
L355262	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	A ticket home,
L355261	u6367	m424	HARRY	What for?
L355260	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
L355259	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why'd you come here?
L355258	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
L355257	u6367	m424	HARRY	What the fuck are you doing here?
L355060	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Swann's wife.
L355059	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is she?
L355057	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you a believer, then?
L355056	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you sure?
L355055	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I don't think the dead much care.
L355054	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
L355053	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Probably.
L355052	u6367	m424	HARRY	Any movie stars buried here?
L355051	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
L355050	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's the difference?
L355049	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
L355048	u6367	m424	HARRY	When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
L355047	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you a gambling man?
L355046	u6367	m424	HARRY	I saw him in Vegas once.
L355045	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You know of him?
L355044	u6367	m424	HARRY	Philip Swann?
L355043	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
L355042	u6367	m424	HARRY	Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
L355041	u6367	m424	HARRY	Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
L355040	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Maybe I just bought it.
L355039	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
L355038	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Mine.
L355037	u6367	m424	HARRY	Whose is the car?
L355035	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
L355034	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
L355033	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm here to offer you a job.
L355032	u6367	m424	HARRY	Then what do you want?
L355031	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	We've never met.
L355030	u6367	m424	HARRY	Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
L355029	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
L355028	u6367	m424	HARRY	What are you, my mother?
L355027	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	It's one in the afternoon.
L355026	u6367	m424	HARRY	Go away.
L355025	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Mr. D'Amour?
L355024	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shit.
L355283	u6367	m424	HARRY	And what does Jennifer think's real?
L355282	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
L355281	u6367	m424	HARRY	Does anybody?
L355280	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	She has no real grip on reality.
L355279	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's her problem?
L355278	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
L355277	u6367	m424	HARRY	I won't say anything.
L355276	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
L355275	u6367	m424	HARRY	A Mister Quaid?
L355274	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
L354972	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is he?
L354971	u6372	m424	QUAID	Yes...
L354970	u6367	m424	HARRY	The Puritan?
L354969	u6372	m424	QUAID	I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
L354968	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hold on.
L354967	u6372	m424	QUAID	You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
L354966	u6367	m424	HARRY	Not much.
L354965	u6372	m424	QUAID	You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
L354964	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah.  You could say that.
L354963	u6372	m424	QUAID	You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
L354962	u6367	m424	HARRY	What?
L354961	u6372	m424	QUAID	My God.
L354959	u6372	m424	QUAID	Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
L354958	u6367	m424	HARRY	You need an ambulance.
L355194	u6377	m424	WILDER	No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
L355193	u6367	m424	HARRY	Have you been in?
L355192	u6377	m424	WILDER	That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
L355191	u6377	m424	WILDER	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
L355190	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are they all in the business?
L355189	u6377	m424	WILDER	You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
L355188	u6367	m424	HARRY	I only wear ties for funerals.
L355186	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well... nobody.
L355185	u6377	m424	WILDER	For an introduction.
L355184	u6367	m424	HARRY	For what?
L355183	u6377	m424	WILDER	People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
L355182	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
L355181	u6377	m424	WILDER	He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
L355180	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sure.  Vivovich.
L355179	u6377	m424	WILDER	You know Vinovich?
L355176	u6367	m424	HARRY	Not the Walter Wilder?
L355175	u6377	m424	WILDER	You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
L355174	u6367	m424	HARRY	Was he taking a lot of risks?
L355173	u6377	m424	WILDER	What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
L355172	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
L355171	u6377	m424	WILDER	I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
L355170	u6367	m424	HARRY	Harry D'Amour.
L355169	u6377	m424	WILDER	At birth.  I don't know you --
L355168	u6367	m424	HARRY	That.
L355167	u6377	m424	WILDER	What?
L355166	u6367	m424	HARRY	Where'd you learn that?
L355685	u6367	m424	HARRY	Try.
L355684	u6373	m424	SWANN	I don't know.
L355683	u6367	m424	HARRY	Can you do it?
L355682	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes?
L355681	u6367	m424	HARRY	He did something with the ground.
L355606	u6373	m424	SWANN	I can't... I can't go any further...
L355605	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't try hard enough.
L355604	u6373	m424	SWANN	This is where we killed him.
L355591	u6367	m424	HARRY	Fuck.
L355590	u6373	m424	SWANN	At a guess... they just resurrected him.
L355589	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
L355572	u6367	m424	HARRY	In my time, and nobody else's.
L355571	u6373	m424	SWANN	That's where we're all going.
L355570	u6373	m424	SWANN	You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
L355569	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nobody's better off this wav!
L355568	u6373	m424	SWANN	He's better off this way.
L355567	u6367	m424	HARRY	... no...
L355549	u6373	m424	SWANN	Looks that way.
L355548	u6367	m424	HARRY	They got here before us.
L355527	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jesus!
L355526	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355525	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who else did?  Did Valentin?
L355524	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.
L355523	u6367	m424	HARRY	Did she know where Nix was buried?
L355518	u6373	m424	SWANN	I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
L355517	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you believed him?
L355516	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
L355515	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is that all?
L355514	u6373	m424	SWANN	He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
L355513	u6367	m424	HARRY	And he didn't have them?
L355512	u6373	m424	SWANN	Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
L355511	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you're not?
L355510	u6373	m424	SWANN	I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
L355509	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is that all?
L355508	u6373	m424	SWANN	I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
L355507	u6367	m424	HARRY	Didn't know you read minds.
L355506	u6373	m424	SWANN	You think I'm an asshole.
L355499	u6373	m424	SWANN	Will that do?  No?
L355498	u6367	m424	HARRY	Oh Jeez.
L355491	u6367	m424	HARRY	Help me.
L355490	u6373	m424	SWANN	I don't know what else to do.
L355489	u6367	m424	HARRY	And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
L355488	u6373	m424	SWANN	It's me betrayed him.
L355487	u6367	m424	HARRY	So Nix won't come looking for her?
L355486	u6373	m424	SWANN	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
L355485	u6367	m424	HARRY	Oh yeah?
L355484	u6373	m424	SWANN	I did it for Dorothea.
L355483	u6367	m424	HARRY	Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
L355482	u6373	m424	SWANN	He deserved it.
L355481	u6367	m424	HARRY	Or murdered, like Nix.
L355480	u6373	m424	SWANN	Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
L355479	u6367	m424	HARRY	You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
L355477	u6373	m424	SWANN	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
L355476	u6367	m424	HARRY	I don't think so.  You need me alive.
L355475	u6373	m424	SWANN	Now I'm going to have to kill you.
L355474	u6367	m424	HARRY	How the fuck do you do that?
L355473	u6373	m424	SWANN	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
L355472	u6367	m424	HARRY	Look, Ma, no wires.
L355471	u6373	m424	SWANN	They'll never find out.
L355470	u6367	m424	HARRY	A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
L355102	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Who is she?
L355101	u6367	m424	HARRY	What?
L355100	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	One question.
L355099	u6367	m424	HARRY	A couple of weeks.
L355098	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
L355097	u6367	m424	HARRY	There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
L355096	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Call me tomorrow.
L355095	u6367	m424	HARRY	I got to go.  I'm late.
L355094	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
L355093	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
L355092	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
L355307	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
L355306	u6367	m424	HARRY	And he's dead?
L355305	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Yes! Yes!
L355304	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is he the Puritan?
L355303	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Nix! Nix!
L355302	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who's not?
L355301	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	He's not!  He's not!
L355296	u6367	m424	HARRY	Swann?
L355295	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
L355294	u6367	m424	HARRY	What is?
L355293	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
L355292	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why's that?
L355291	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
L355290	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Philip Swann?
L355289	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Maybe... I... don't...
L355288	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
L355287	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
L355286	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355285	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Have we met before?
L355646	u6371	m424	NIX	Liar!
L355645	u6373	m424	SWANN	No!
L355644	u6371	m424	NIX	Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
L355643	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355642	u6371	m424	NIX	But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
L355641	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355640	u6371	m424	NIX	You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
L355633	u6371	m424	NIX	The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
L355632	u6373	m424	SWANN	Not true.
L355631	u6371	m424	NIX	Because you've got nothing else to live for.
L355630	u6373	m424	SWANN	Why would I want to?
L355629	u6371	m424	NIX	You could still help me do that.
L355628	u6371	m424	NIX	I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
L355627	u6373	m424	SWANN	And?
L354908	u6373	m424	SWANN	Binding you.
L354907	u6371	m424	NIX	Swann?  What are you doing?
L354898	u6371	m424	NIX	You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
L354897	u6373	m424	SWANN	Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
L354884	u6373	m424	SWANN	No!
L354883	u6371	m424	NIX	You don't think I've got it to give?
L354882	u6373	m424	SWANN	Fuck you.
L354881	u6371	m424	NIX	I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
L359126	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	We're still going to be together.
L359125	u6398	m426	PETER	You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
L359124	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
L359123	u6398	m426	PETER	So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
L359122	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	She's been stalking you, Peter.
L359121	u6398	m426	PETER	I found the pentacle.
L359120	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
L359118	u6398	m426	PETER	I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
L359117	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Must be a spare set.
L359116	u6398	m426	PETER	I found them in your file box.
L359115	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	I don't know.  What are they?
L359114	u6398	m426	PETER	What're these?
L359112	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	This is the person...you were talking about?
L359111	u6398	m426	PETER	Claire...
L359110	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
L358981	u6398	m426	PETER	I believe in you.
L358980	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	You need to believe in something besides yourself.
L358979	u6398	m426	PETER	I'm just temporarily off my game.
L358978	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
L358977	u6398	m426	PETER	It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
L358976	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
L358975	u6398	m426	PETER	Yeah, like...
L358974	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
L358973	u6398	m426	PETER	You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
L358972	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
L358971	u6398	m426	PETER	I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
L358900	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Thank God he did.
L358899	u6398	m426	PETER	I can't believe Will killed him.
L358898	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	I'm still shaking.
L358895	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	When did they find her?
L358894	u6398	m426	PETER	Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
L358892	u6398	m426	PETER	What happened?
L358891	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	What?  That's horrible!
L358819	u6398	m426	PETER	"Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the ""stop"" button?"
L358818	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	I spaced out.
L358817	u6398	m426	PETER	Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
L358816	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
L358796	u6398	m426	PETER	No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
L358795	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
L358794	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
L358793	u6398	m426	PETER	Says she can get me in to see this killer.
L358792	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
L358791	u6398	m426	PETER	Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
L358790	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Peter, where are you?
L358789	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
L358788	u6398	m426	PETER	Hmmm.
L358787	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
L358786	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Sushi.
L358785	u6398	m426	PETER	Uh...sure...I...what?
L358784	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
L358783	u6398	m426	PETER	Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
L358782	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Bad?
L358781	u6398	m426	PETER	Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
L358668	u6398	m426	PETER	It's probably trivial.
L358667	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	You never said anything to me...
L358635	u6398	m426	PETER	It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
L358634	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
L358623	u6398	m426	PETER	She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
L358622	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
L358621	u6398	m426	PETER	Do you think they have a room here?
L358620	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	I missed you.
L358659	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Eight.  That okay?
L358658	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	What time did you make it for?
L358657	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
L358640	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Yes.  It's exactly...
L358639	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	...you wearing a watch, Father?
L358638	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
L358637	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
L358636	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
L358632	u6387	m426	CLAIRE	Peter, are you okay?
L358631	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	What a...jerk!
L358579	u6396	m426	MR. SILBERMAN	Just me.
L358578	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
L358577	u6396	m426	MR. SILBERMAN	He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
L358576	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
L358575	u6396	m426	MR. SILBERMAN	Seemed...on edge.
L358574	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
L358573	u6396	m426	MR. SILBERMAN	Quiet.  Real quiet...
L358572	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	And how would you describe him?
L358571	u6396	m426	MR. SILBERMAN	Yes.
L358803	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
L358802	u6403	m426	VIZNICK	I can take care of myself.
L358801	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	You have to tell me who did it.
L358800	u6403	m426	VIZNICK	Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
L358799	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
L358798	u6403	m426	VIZNICK	It's nothing.
L358797	u6388	m426	DEFENSE ATTORNEY	George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
L358841	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
L358840	u6398	m426	PETER	So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
L358839	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
L358838	u6398	m426	PETER	No, I wasn't, actually.
L358837	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
L358836	u6398	m426	PETER	My secretary?
L358835	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
L358834	u6398	m426	PETER	Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
L358833	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
L358553	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	I think I should join you.
L358552	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
L358551	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
L358550	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	It's the patient's request, doctor.
L358549	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
L358548	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	But your patient is legally entitled to it.
L358547	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	You know I'm not comfortable with this.
L358546	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Your court order, Dr. Allen.
L358848	u6393	m426	MAYA	You heard voices, you know you did.
L358847	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
L358846	u6393	m426	MAYA	And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
L358845	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
L358844	u6393	m426	MAYA	What did you hear?
L358843	u6389	m426	DR. ALLEN	I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
L358842	u6393	m426	MAYA	Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
L359155	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
L359154	u6393	m426	MAYA	You'll do it?
L358970	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	You have a sister in New Orleans.
L358969	u6393	m426	MAYA	Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
L358968	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
L358709	u6393	m426	MAYA	I hope so.
L358708	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	Is he going to be okay?
L358699	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
L358698	u6393	m426	MAYA	He will.  He has great faith.
L358697	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
L358687	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
L358686	u6393	m426	MAYA	If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
L358685	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
L358684	u6393	m426	MAYA	You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
L358683	u6390	m426	FATHER FRANK	I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
L359215	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
L359214	u6398	m426	PETER	You killed my parents.
L359213	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
L359212	u6398	m426	PETER	You raised me, like a son.
L359211	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
L359210	u6398	m426	PETER	You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
L359209	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
L359208	u6398	m426	PETER	So all that bullshit about God and faith.
L359207	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
L359206	u6398	m426	PETER	You fucking bastard.
L358912	u6398	m426	PETER	You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
L358911	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
L358910	u6398	m426	PETER	But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
L358909	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	No matter, my son, he believes in you.
L358908	u6398	m426	PETER	You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
L358907	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
L358906	u6398	m426	PETER	Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
L358905	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	He spoke to you?
L358904	u6398	m426	PETER	Something he said, just before...
L358903	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	What is it?
L358630	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
L358629	u6398	m426	PETER	You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
L358628	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
L358625	u6398	m426	PETER	You ready?
L358624	u6391	m426	FATHER JAMES	How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
L359181	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
L359180	u6393	m426	MAYA	Father, please don't die.
L359145	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Miette, come here and relax.
L359144	u6393	m426	MAYA	So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
L359143	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
L359142	u6393	m426	MAYA	So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
L359141	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
L359140	u6393	m426	MAYA	We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
L359139	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Yes.  We won, that's right.
L359138	u6393	m426	MAYA	So...we won?
L359135	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
L359134	u6393	m426	MAYA	"What do you mean ""don't worry?"""
L359133	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
L359132	u6393	m426	MAYA	Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
L358695	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
L358694	u6393	m426	MAYA	Father, I'm right here.
L358693	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
L358555	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	Just open the door, please.
L358554	u6393	m426	MAYA	-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
L358542	u6392	m426	LAREAUX	I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
L358541	u6393	m426	MAYA	Why are you doing this to me?
L358729	u6393	m426	MAYA	Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
L358728	u6399	m426	RECEPTIONIST	Two negatives always make a positive.
L358726	u6393	m426	MAYA	I didn't know what else to do...
L358725	u6399	m426	RECEPTIONIST	You just call?
L358724	u6393	m426	MAYA	Peter...Peter Kelson.
L358723	u6399	m426	RECEPTIONIST	What's his name?
L358722	u6393	m426	MAYA	Well I know he's come here before.
L358721	u6399	m426	RECEPTIONIST	You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
L358720	u6393	m426	MAYA	"Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says ""Goodbye?"""
L358719	u6399	m426	RECEPTIONIST	How many weeks are you honey/
L358718	u6393	m426	MAYA	I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
L358714	u6399	m426	RECEPTIONIST	Kelson, hold on a second...
L358713	u6393	m426	MAYA	Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
L359231	u6398	m426	PETER	It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
L359230	u6393	m426	MAYA	Oh, Peter.
L359226	u6393	m426	MAYA	Not a lot.
L359225	u6398	m426	PETER	How much time do we have?
L359198	u6398	m426	PETER	And what's that mean?
L359197	u6393	m426	MAYA	"Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  ""But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."""
L359192	u6398	m426	PETER	"And his message was  ""Together, no matter what?"""
L359191	u6393	m426	MAYA	He was trying to tell me something.
L359190	u6398	m426	PETER	Terrific.
L359189	u6393	m426	MAYA	"That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, ""together, no matter what."""
L359188	u6398	m426	PETER	What did he say to you in French?
L359187	u6393	m426	MAYA	He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
L359186	u6398	m426	PETER	So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
L359185	u6393	m426	MAYA	I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
L359153	u6393	m426	MAYA	You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
L359152	u6398	m426	PETER	What can I do?
L359109	u6398	m426	PETER	Sure.
L359108	u6393	m426	MAYA	Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
L359107	u6398	m426	PETER	I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
L359106	u6393	m426	MAYA	What are these?
L359105	u6398	m426	PETER	Plenty of time.
L359101	u6393	m426	MAYA	Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
L359100	u6398	m426	PETER	What about after?
L359099	u6393	m426	MAYA	Until it happens, you're still a human being.
L359098	u6398	m426	PETER	Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
L359097	u6393	m426	MAYA	Maybe that's my problem.
L359096	u6398	m426	PETER	No oxygen to the brain.
L359095	u6393	m426	MAYA	I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
L359094	u6398	m426	PETER	Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
L359093	u6393	m426	MAYA	I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
L359092	u6398	m426	PETER	Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
L359087	u6398	m426	PETER	That's true.
L359086	u6393	m426	MAYA	You have to say that.
L359085	u6398	m426	PETER	We're going to do this.
L359084	u6393	m426	MAYA	I'm scared I'm slipping back.
L359083	u6393	m426	MAYA	I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
L359082	u6398	m426	PETER	What do you mean?
L359081	u6393	m426	MAYA	Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
L359080	u6398	m426	PETER	Are you alright?
L359076	u6393	m426	MAYA	Comfort.
L359075	u6398	m426	PETER	What's the bible for?
L359074	u6393	m426	MAYA	There's nothing else here.
L359073	u6398	m426	PETER	I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
L359072	u6393	m426	MAYA	He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
L359070	u6398	m426	PETER	That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
L359069	u6393	m426	MAYA	It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
L359068	u6393	m426	MAYA	Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
L359067	u6398	m426	PETER	Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
L359066	u6398	m426	PETER	What?
L359065	u6393	m426	MAYA	When's your birthday?
L359064	u6398	m426	PETER	You okay?
L359061	u6398	m426	PETER	What?
L359060	u6393	m426	MAYA	Peter, let go of the chair!
L359059	u6398	m426	PETER	What's the...OH SHIT!
L359058	u6393	m426	MAYA	Get up!!
L359046	u6398	m426	PETER	I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
L359045	u6393	m426	MAYA	Nothing yet.
L359041	u6398	m426	PETER	I'm going to look around.
L359040	u6393	m426	MAYA	We needed to know all we could.
L359037	u6393	m426	MAYA	The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
L359036	u6398	m426	PETER	What are you looking for exactly?
L359034	u6393	m426	MAYA	Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
L359033	u6398	m426	PETER	"When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  ""The time of transformation is near..."""
L359032	u6393	m426	MAYA	I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
L359031	u6398	m426	PETER	And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
L359030	u6393	m426	MAYA	Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
L359029	u6393	m426	MAYA	Then why are you here?
L359028	u6398	m426	PETER	So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
L359027	u6393	m426	MAYA	Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
L359026	u6398	m426	PETER	I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
L359025	u6393	m426	MAYA	Do you know your parents' blood types?
L359024	u6398	m426	PETER	Yes.
L359023	u6393	m426	MAYA	Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
L359022	u6398	m426	PETER	So what?
L359021	u6393	m426	MAYA	The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
L359020	u6398	m426	PETER	Yes, I know.
L359019	u6393	m426	MAYA	You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
L359018	u6398	m426	PETER	But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
L359017	u6393	m426	MAYA	There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
L359016	u6398	m426	PETER	I don't understand what's going on.
L358967	u6398	m426	PETER	If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
L358966	u6393	m426	MAYA	You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
L358965	u6398	m426	PETER	My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
L358964	u6393	m426	MAYA	I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
L358963	u6398	m426	PETER	I'm not going to be drawn into this.
L358962	u6393	m426	MAYA	You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
L358961	u6398	m426	PETER	You should think about getting professional help.
L358960	u6393	m426	MAYA	The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
L358959	u6398	m426	PETER	Trick him.
L358958	u6393	m426	MAYA	If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
L358957	u6398	m426	PETER	Why didn't Birdson just say so?
L358956	u6393	m426	MAYA	It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
L358955	u6398	m426	PETER	What?!?!
L358954	u6393	m426	MAYA	At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
L358953	u6398	m426	PETER	And the point is?
L358952	u6393	m426	MAYA	Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
L358951	u6398	m426	PETER	Why did he try to kill me?
L358950	u6393	m426	MAYA	Please, the children.
L358949	u6398	m426	PETER	Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
L358945	u6393	m426	MAYA	Peter, please...
L358944	u6398	m426	PETER	We need to talk.
L358859	u6398	m426	PETER	Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
L358858	u6393	m426	MAYA	That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
L358857	u6398	m426	PETER	And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
L358856	u6393	m426	MAYA	I had to.
L358855	u6398	m426	PETER	Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
L358828	u6393	m426	MAYA	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
L358827	u6398	m426	PETER	So what'd I miss?
L358826	u6398	m426	PETER	I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
L358825	u6393	m426	MAYA	You're sure?  There was nothing?
L358824	u6398	m426	PETER	It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
L358823	u6393	m426	MAYA	What do you mean?
L358822	u6398	m426	PETER	I think you gave me the wrong one.
L358821	u6393	m426	MAYA	So...what did you think of the tape.
L358769	u6393	m426	MAYA	Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
L358768	u6398	m426	PETER	The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
L358767	u6393	m426	MAYA	On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
L358766	u6398	m426	PETER	I'll bet.
L358765	u6393	m426	MAYA	An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
L358764	u6398	m426	PETER	I do.
L358763	u6393	m426	MAYA	Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
L358762	u6398	m426	PETER	What's that got to do with you?
L358761	u6393	m426	MAYA	Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
L358760	u6398	m426	PETER	Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
L358759	u6393	m426	MAYA	In the end, the jury saw it my way.
L358758	u6398	m426	PETER	Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
L358757	u6393	m426	MAYA	I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
L358756	u6398	m426	PETER	Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
L358755	u6393	m426	MAYA	And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
L358754	u6398	m426	PETER	A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
L358753	u6393	m426	MAYA	What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
L358752	u6398	m426	PETER	Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
L358751	u6393	m426	MAYA	"That there is no such thing as evil with a capital ""E."""
L358750	u6398	m426	PETER	Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
L358749	u6393	m426	MAYA	And also that...
L358748	u6398	m426	PETER	Not pure evil.  That's correct.
L358747	u6393	m426	MAYA	You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
L358746	u6398	m426	PETER	Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
L358745	u6393	m426	MAYA	I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
L358744	u6398	m426	PETER	Yes... and you are?
L358743	u6393	m426	MAYA	Peter Kelson?
L358742	u6398	m426	PETER	May I help you?
L358643	u6398	m426	PETER	...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
L358642	u6393	m426	MAYA	Oh my God!
L358707	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	I'm not waiting until it's too late.
L358706	u6393	m426	MAYA	Look, John, I'm facing it.
L358705	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	You don't want to face it.
L358704	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
L358703	u6393	m426	MAYA	You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
L358702	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	It's useless...look at him.
L358680	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
L358679	u6393	m426	MAYA	We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
L358678	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
L358677	u6393	m426	MAYA	We need all the help we can get.
L358676	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	A lot of good that'll do.
L358675	u6393	m426	MAYA	I've filed a report with Father Frank.
L358674	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	And what are you thinking we should do now?
L358647	u6393	m426	MAYA	I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
L358646	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	Maya?  What do you mean?
L358645	u6393	m426	MAYA	I know who he is.
L358644	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	Hello?
L358545	u6402	m426	TOWNSEND	Whish the circumstances were different.
L358544	u6393	m426	MAYA	Good seeing you again.
L359009	u6394	m426	MELVIN	Goodbye.
L359008	u6398	m426	PETER	Get out of here.
L359007	u6394	m426	MELVIN	You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
L359006	u6394	m426	MELVIN	Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
L359005	u6398	m426	PETER	You know what?  You can go.
L359004	u6394	m426	MELVIN	Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
L359003	u6398	m426	PETER	Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
L359002	u6394	m426	MELVIN	But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
L359000	u6394	m426	MELVIN	You are the younger of two...
L358999	u6398	m426	PETER	I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
L358586	u6395	m426	MICHAEL	Nice suit.
L358585	u6398	m426	PETER	I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
L358584	u6395	m426	MICHAEL	The police used him as a witness in this case.
L358583	u6398	m426	PETER	I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
L358582	u6395	m426	MICHAEL	He can see you Thursday.
L358581	u6398	m426	PETER	What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
L358580	u6395	m426	MICHAEL	Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
L358997	u6398	m426	PETER	We millionaires yet?
L358996	u6397	m426	MRS. QUINTANA	Good of you to stop by.
L358920	u6397	m426	MRS. QUINTANA	It's Detective Smythe.
L358919	u6398	m426	PETER	Yeah.
L358739	u6397	m426	MRS. QUINTANA	You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
L358738	u6398	m426	PETER	You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
L358737	u6397	m426	MRS. QUINTANA	Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
L358736	u6398	m426	PETER	Lemme guess.  The lottery.
L358735	u6397	m426	MRS. QUINTANA	I plan to.  You want a tip?
L358619	u6398	m426	PETER	Of course.
L358618	u6400	m426	SALLY	Would you sign it for me?
L358611	u6400	m426	SALLY	And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
L358610	u6398	m426	PETER	Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
L358609	u6400	m426	SALLY	Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
L358608	u6398	m426	PETER	Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
L358607	u6400	m426	SALLY	Are you saying he's legally sane?
L358606	u6398	m426	PETER	Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
L358605	u6400	m426	SALLY	What do you mean by that?
L358604	u6398	m426	PETER	As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
L358603	u6400	m426	SALLY	Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
L358602	u6398	m426	PETER	There weren't any voices.
L358601	u6400	m426	SALLY	"You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by ""demonic voices?"""
L358600	u6398	m426	PETER	"No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital ""E.""  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings."
L358599	u6400	m426	SALLY	It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
L358598	u6398	m426	PETER	Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
L358597	u6400	m426	SALLY	Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
L358596	u6398	m426	PETER	Thanks for having me, Sally.
L358595	u6400	m426	SALLY	As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
L358937	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
L358936	u6398	m426	PETER	Where is she now?
L358935	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
L358934	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
L358933	u6398	m426	PETER	She told me she killed them.
L358932	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
L358931	u6398	m426	PETER	What happened?
L358930	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Yeah, murder-suicide.
L358929	u6398	m426	PETER	Parents died?
L358928	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
L358927	u6398	m426	PETER	She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
L358924	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
L358923	u6398	m426	PETER	It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
L358922	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	How're you doin' today?
L358921	u6398	m426	PETER	What's up?
L358885	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
L358884	u6398	m426	PETER	Thanks again for everything.
L358881	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
L358880	u6398	m426	PETER	Thanks for handling this.
L358813	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	I'll quit, maybe you should start.
L358812	u6398	m426	PETER	He could see me.
L358811	u6398	m426	PETER	He's looking right at me.
L358810	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	What's the matter with you?
L358806	u6398	m426	PETER	You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
L358805	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
L358804	u6398	m426	PETER	Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
L358594	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
L358593	u6398	m426	PETER	What's this?
L358592	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
L358591	u6398	m426	PETER	Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
L358590	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
L358589	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
L358588	u6398	m426	PETER	Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
L358587	u6401	m426	SMYTHE	Hey!  Mr. big shot.
L368286	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
L368285	u6466	m430	CRAIG	You mind if I ride with you?
L368279	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
L368278	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
L368266	u6468	m430	DOYLE	If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
L368265	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Every step of the way.
L368264	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Cooperate?
L368263	u6466	m430	CRAIG	I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
L368262	u6466	m430	CRAIG	That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
L368261	u6468	m430	DOYLE	If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
L368260	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
L368259	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
L368258	u6466	m430	CRAIG	I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
L368257	u6468	m430	DOYLE	We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
L368256	u6466	m430	CRAIG	We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
L368254	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
L368253	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
L368252	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What can I do for you?
L368250	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?
L368249	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Captain Doyle?
L368294	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Alright, stay on the phone.
L368293	u6467	m430	D.T.	What do you think?
L368292	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	You set to go -
L368291	u6467	m430	D.T.	We're by Ozone...
L368290	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Where are you?
L368289	u6467	m430	D.T.	Yeah?
L368138	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
L368137	u6467	m430	D.T.	You mean shut your ass down!
L368136	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	So what is they have enough to shut us down!
L368135	u6467	m430	D.T.	So what?
L368134	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
L368133	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
L368132	u6467	m430	D.T.	What do you need?
L368131	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	It's Marvosa -
L368439	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
L368438	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	It's just...catching up with me, you know?
L368437	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Something wrong with you Marvosa?
L368434	u6468	m430	DOYLE	That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
L368433	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
L368429	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
L368428	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
L368426	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Where do you come from, Marvosa?
L368425	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Gotta come from somewhere...
L368424	u6468	m430	DOYLE	It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
L368423	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What?
L368422	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Well don't you think that's odd?
L368421	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
L368420	u6468	m430	DOYLE	So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
L368419	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Yeah...
L368418	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Did you start out area six?
L368417	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
L368416	u6468	m430	DOYLE	When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
L368415	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What?
L368403	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
L368402	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What's this?
L368284	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Fine -
L368283	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	I'll take the south end -
L368282	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
L368281	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
L368280	u6468	m430	DOYLE	If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
L368270	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Right behind you.
L368269	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Let's roll -
L368244	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Fine...
L368243	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Find out for me.
L368241	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
L368240	u6468	m430	DOYLE	But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
L368239	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
L368238	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
L368237	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What did the six-toes have to say?
L368202	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I didn't hit shit!
L368201	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Did you hit him?
L368125	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Don't worry -
L368124	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
L368122	u6468	m430	DOYLE	We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
L368121	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
L368120	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Great. Well that changes a lot...
L368119	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
L368118	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What the hell is this Marvosa!!
L368099	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
L368098	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
L368097	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
L368096	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
L368095	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
L368094	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What the hell happened?
L368060	u6468	m430	DOYLE	we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
L368059	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	You can cut the shit, asshole--
L368053	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Did you report it stolen?
L368052	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Bullshit...
L368572	u6469	m430	JIM	It wasn't in the cards.
L368571	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
L368570	u6469	m430	JIM	I'll live...
L368569	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Are you alright?
L368056	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
L368055	u6469	m430	JIM	I didn't break in - the back door was open!
L368054	u6468	m430	DOYLE	So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
L368051	u6469	m430	JIM	She stole my car!!
L368041	u6469	m430	JIM	I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
L368040	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
L368039	u6469	m430	JIM	And who are you?
L368038	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Alright, where is she?
L368223	u6470	m430	LURCH	Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
L368222	u6468	m430	DOYLE	And what did he do to the girl?
L368221	u6470	m430	LURCH	I was just having a little fun -
L368219	u6470	m430	LURCH	Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
L368218	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
L368217	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
L368216	u6470	m430	LURCH	Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
L368215	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Did he harm the girl?
L368214	u6470	m430	LURCH	Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
L368213	u6468	m430	DOYLE	And he took a swing at you?
L368212	u6470	m430	LURCH	The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
L368388	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
L368387	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	He said he was following up some lead.
L368386	u6468	m430	DOYLE	And where the hell is Marvosa?
L368380	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Could explain why Fleming was there.
L368379	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
L368378	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
L368377	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Something I don't already know?
L368376	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Well read this -
L368375	u6468	m430	DOYLE	No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
L368374	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Did you read today's paper?
L368115	u6468	m430	DOYLE	That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
L368114	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
L368113	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What?  Wait a minute -
L368112	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
L368111	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?
L368110	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
L368109	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Zydowski.  It's about time.
L368432	u6472	m430	OFFICER	LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
L368431	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?
L368430	u6472	m430	OFFICER	Captain?
L368384	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
L368383	u6472	m430	OFFICER	They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
L368382	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Speak of the devil.
L368314	u6472	m430	OFFICER	I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
L368313	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Where is he?!!
L368247	u6472	m430	OFFICER	I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
L368246	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Who is it?
L368245	u6472	m430	OFFICER	Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
L368579	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
L368578	u6469	m430	JIM	No -
L368577	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
L368576	u6469	m430	JIM	Where the hell is my car?
L368575	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Yeah.
L368574	u6469	m430	JIM	There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
L368526	u6469	m430	JIM	So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
L368525	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
L368524	u6469	m430	JIM	What happened with the tape?
L368523	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
L368522	u6469	m430	JIM	What did you do then?
L368521	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I had it all on tape...
L368518	u6469	m430	JIM	Found what?
L368516	u6469	m430	JIM	And what did you do?
L368504	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Yeah...they did.  One girl...
L368503	u6469	m430	JIM	Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
L368502	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
L368501	u6469	m430	JIM	No, but I'm listening.
L368500	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
L368499	u6469	m430	JIM	What exactly did you see?
L368498	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	No.  A witness.
L368497	u6469	m430	JIM	Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
L368496	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
L368495	u6469	m430	JIM	Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
L368494	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
L368493	u6469	m430	JIM	Why did you set me up?
L368456	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You'll find out - soon enough.
L368455	u6469	m430	JIM	What's going on here?
L367994	u6469	m430	JIM	Only on dates?
L367993	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	No.
L367992	u6469	m430	JIM	You always carry a gun with you?
L367991	u6469	m430	JIM	Figure you would have tried it already.
L367990	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
L367989	u6469	m430	JIM	No...
L367988	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Mind if I turn out the light?
L367985	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You're the mysterious type, right?
L367984	u6469	m430	JIM	No...
L367983	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You got any family?
L367982	u6469	m430	JIM	Seattle.
L367981	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Where up north?
L367980	u6469	m430	JIM	Up north.
L367979	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	So where are you from?
L368467	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
L368466	u6469	m430	JIM	Are you going to be alright?
L368464	u6469	m430	JIM	I'm going to need a way to get there.
L368463	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
L368462	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
L368461	u6469	m430	JIM	Tubbs, these people mean business.
L368460	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I'm not going anywhere!
L368459	u6469	m430	JIM	That was her - the girl... We have to go.
L368448	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
L368447	u6469	m430	JIM	It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
L368446	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
L368444	u6474	m430	TUBBS	And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
L368443	u6469	m430	JIM	Both at the same bank...
L368442	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
L368441	u6469	m430	JIM	A bank?
L368440	u6474	m430	TUBBS	OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
L368372	u6469	m430	JIM	What else is new?
L368371	u6474	m430	TUBBS	You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
L368370	u6469	m430	JIM	I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
L368369	u6474	m430	TUBBS	So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
L368368	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
L368367	u6469	m430	JIM	How about Marvosa and the others?
L368366	u6469	m430	JIM	OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
L368365	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
L368364	u6469	m430	JIM	I knew I could count on you.
L368363	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
L368362	u6469	m430	JIM	No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
L368361	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Donut?
L368360	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Let's see what we got...
L368359	u6469	m430	JIM	1490...Breckinridge...
L368358	u6474	m430	TUBBS	OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
L368356	u6474	m430	TUBBS	OK...where do you want to start?
L368355	u6469	m430	JIM	I've got a better idea...
L368354	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
L368353	u6469	m430	JIM	I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
L368352	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
L368351	u6469	m430	JIM	I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
L368350	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Oh man...what happened?
L368349	u6469	m430	JIM	I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
L368348	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
L368347	u6469	m430	JIM	They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
L368346	u6474	m430	TUBBS	You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
L368345	u6469	m430	JIM	It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
L368344	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
L368343	u6469	m430	JIM	Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
L368342	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
L368341	u6469	m430	JIM	I killed them.
L368340	u6474	m430	TUBBS	And?...
L368338	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
L368337	u6469	m430	JIM	No...
L368332	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
L368331	u6469	m430	JIM	Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
L368330	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Holy shit -
L368273	u6474	m430	TUBBS	This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
L368272	u6469	m430	JIM	Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
L368180	u6469	m430	JIM	Please...
L368179	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Jesus, man...
L368178	u6469	m430	JIM	It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
L368177	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
L368176	u6469	m430	JIM	Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
L368175	u6474	m430	TUBBS	You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -

L367969	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Screw him!
L367968	u6469	m430	JIM	What would your - boyfriend - think?
L367966	u6469	m430	JIM	Bartender said there are motels south of here.
L367965	u6475	m430	WOMAN	We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
L367964	u6469	m430	JIM	Ditched you?

L367962	u6469	m430	JIM	Are you a regular there?
L367961	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
L367960	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
L367957	u6469	m430	JIM	Hop in.
L367956	u6475	m430	WOMAN	I'm stranded out here.
L367955	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Mind if I come along for the ride?
L367954	u6469	m430	JIM	I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
L367953	u6475	m430	WOMAN	You must be going somewhere.
L367952	u6469	m430	JIM	Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
L367951	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Where are you going?
L368063	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	County jail - get in.
L368062	u6469	m430	JIM	Where am I going?
L368048	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Then what did you do, play canasta?
L368047	u6469	m430	JIM	No.  It wasn't like that!
L368046	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
L368045	u6469	m430	JIM	What?
L368044	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Did you have sex with her?
L368043	u6469	m430	JIM	No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
L368486	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Nahhh...
L368485	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
L368484	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
L368483	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
L368482	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Long gone, huh?
L368472	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
L368471	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Where is he?
L368470	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Don't you guys ever knock?
L374319	u6528	m434	BOY	Let go of her.
L374318	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
L374316	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nothing's private...
L374315	u6528	m434	BOY	Look fella...this is private...
L374314	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
L374210	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
L374209	u6528	m434	BOY	Sounds good.

L374000	u6529	m434	BOY #1	No.
L373997	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
L373996	u6529	m434	BOY #1	Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
L373993	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.

L374003	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Yeah.
L373999	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
L373998	u6530	m434	BOY #2	Well, we want good stuff.
L373995	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...

L373991	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
L373990	u6530	m434	BOY #2	Well the guy over there said...
L373989	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
L374018	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
L374017	u6531	m434	BOYS	Uh...can we give you a check?
L374016	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
L374015	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
L374014	u6531	m434	BOYS	Can't we come with you?
L374013	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I gotta get the stuff.
L374012	u6531	m434	BOYS	Why?
L374011	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
L374009	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok.  Wait here.
L374008	u6531	m434	BOYS	Yeah.
L374379	u6543	m434	TONY	Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
L374378	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
L374377	u6543	m434	TONY	Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
L374376	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Panther!  Same thing...
L374375	u6543	m434	TONY	Panther...
L374373	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Thanks for the ride.
L374372	u6543	m434	TONY	Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
L374371	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I'll say that I'm travelling.
L374370	u6543	m434	TONY	And say what?
L374369	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
L374368	u6543	m434	TONY	How about Teresa?  I could talk...
L374367	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
L374366	u6543	m434	TONY	Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
L374365	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hey, come on...
L374364	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L374363	u6543	m434	TONY	You flew before?
L374362	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah.
L374361	u6543	m434	TONY	Nervous?
L374360	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
L374359	u6543	m434	TONY	So?
L374358	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
L374357	u6543	m434	TONY	I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
L374356	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Kennedy.
L374355	u6543	m434	TONY	Where to?
L374338	u6543	m434	TONY	Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
L374337	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
L374336	u6543	m434	TONY	Get out of here before this really goes up.
L374304	u6543	m434	TONY	Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
L374303	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	She don't look Jewish.
L374302	u6543	m434	TONY	Look at her.
L374301	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How do you know?
L374300	u6543	m434	TONY	Jewish...
L374299	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Who's the girl?
L374054	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
L374053	u6543	m434	TONY	Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
L374051	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
L374050	u6543	m434	TONY	'Thou art then a king?'
L374049	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
L374047	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
L374046	u6543	m434	TONY	'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
L374045	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Salute!!!
L374044	u6543	m434	TONY	'And with your spirit.'
L374043	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	May God be with you.
L373766	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Anybody wanna have a game?
L373765	u6543	m434	TONY	No.
L373755	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
L373754	u6543	m434	TONY	You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
L373753	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
L373746	u6543	m434	TONY	'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
L373745	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
L373742	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Be careful.
L373741	u6543	m434	TONY	Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
L373740	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
L373739	u6543	m434	TONY	Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
L374200	u6535	m434	JIMMY	Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
L374199	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You got some mouth!
L374165	u6535	m434	JIMMY	I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
L374164	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
L374163	u6535	m434	JIMMY	The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
L374162	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Next time, bet with your own kind.
L373761	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not quite...but keep trying.
L373760	u6535	m434	JIMMY	Waddaya think?
L374344	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Good idea.
L374343	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What are you going to do?  Hide me?
L374342	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Forget it.
L374341	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
L374340	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L374339	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I think we should see your uncle.
L374324	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
L374323	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
L374296	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Mind your own business.
L374295	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Back so soon.
L374289	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'll be here.  Don't worry.
L374288	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't you move!!!
L374285	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Come on.
L374284	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
L374283	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
L374282	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
L374281	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh, cut it out, will ya?
L374280	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	No you're not...
L374279	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
L374274	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
L374273	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
L374262	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
L374261	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
L374257	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
L374256	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't be smart.
L374255	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
L374254	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
L374253	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
L374251	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
L374250	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Shut up!
L374184	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	You tell me that in front of these creeps?
L374183	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Keep your mouth shut.
L374099	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I understand.
L374098	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
L374097	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
L374096	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
L374095	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
L374094	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
L374093	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How?
L374092	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
L374091	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
L374090	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
L374089	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
L374088	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
L374087	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's not going to help.
L374086	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
L374085	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Did you see them run!
L374084	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Let's get out of here.
L374081	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
L374080	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
L374077	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
L374076	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Don't come any closer!!!
L373829	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
L373828	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I could have told you that.
L373827	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hey...you got nothing here.
L373825	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Listen...I'm a guest here.
L373824	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
L373823	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
L373822	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't promise...just deliver.
L373821	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
L373820	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
L373819	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
L373818	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
L373817	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I don't like loading crates.
L373816	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
L373815	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Didn't show up.
L373814	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What do you mean?
L373813	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	There won't be any this week.
L373812	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
L373811	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Don't worry.  I can handle it.
L373810	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
L373809	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Wouldn't bother me.
L373808	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
L373805	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, she isn't.
L373804	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
L373775	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Should I slap him?
L373774	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
L373764	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
L373763	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Nah.
L373731	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
L373730	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	It's the truth, I swear.
L373712	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
L373711	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I know but let's hear it anyway.
L373710	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
L373709	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What happened to you Flash?
L373698	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Giovanino!  Where have you been?
L373697	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Drinks for everybody Tony...
L373889	u6540	m434	OSCAR	What can I say?
L373888	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
L373887	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
L373886	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't understand, where's Groppi?
L373885	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
L373884	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
L373883	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
L373882	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
L373881	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
L373880	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That bad, huh?
L373879	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
L373878	u6540	m434	OSCAR	What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
L373877	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What pipes?
L373876	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
L373875	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L373874	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
L373873	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok, how's everything going?
L373872	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
L374332	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
L374331	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're really crazy.
L374327	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, where's the rest?
L374326	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Where's the rest?
L374240	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Whatever.
L374239	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
L374234	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	We'll be here.
L374233	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
L374068	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You said it.
L374067	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
L374066	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
L374065	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
L374064	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
L374063	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
L374062	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Charlie, this is business.
L374061	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
L374060	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
L374059	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How much was the original loan again?
L374058	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
L374057	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
L374056	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
L374032	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Let's go to the movies...on you.
L374031	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	$20.
L374030	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How much?
L374029	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
L374028	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What's a'matter?
L373982	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	We'll settle it tonight.
L373981	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
L373980	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
L373979	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
L373978	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh Michael, look...
L373801	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
L373800	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You getting out too?
L373799	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	C'mon Johnny.
L373798	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Out!!!!
L373797	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok...that's it.
L373796	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Disgraceful.
L373792	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Get him in.
L373791	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Hey, shut up.
L373769	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	OK, get in.
L373768	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, give us a lift.
L373695	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	OK.
L373694	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
L373693	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
L373692	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
L373691	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
L373690	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
L373689	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
L373688	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
L373687	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
L373686	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
L373685	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nope...
L373684	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
L373683	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...I'll be ok for a week.
L373682	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
L373681	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	OK, ok...
L373680	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
L373679	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh great...hey - Winstons?
L374232	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Bye.
L374231	u6533	m434	DIANE	Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
L374230	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
L374229	u6533	m434	DIANE	Chinese food?
L374228	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
L374227	u6533	m434	DIANE	Hostess?
L374226	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...no stripping...as the hostess.
L374225	u6533	m434	DIANE	Stripper?
L374224	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
L374223	u6533	m434	DIANE	That's nice.
L374222	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
L374221	u6533	m434	DIANE	I know.
L374220	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, I'm serious...You're really good.
L374219	u6533	m434	DIANE	Fine.
L374218	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
L374217	u6533	m434	DIANE	Fine.
L374216	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Diane, how are you feeling?
L374152	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
L374151	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Well, maybe you missed something?
L374148	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	All right.
L374147	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	"Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm ""cumpari"" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved."
L374146	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What do they expect you to say?
L374145	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
L374144	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
L374143	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, she's got epilepsy.
L374142	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
L374141	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Teresa.
L374140	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
L374135	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What did he do?
L374134	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
L374129	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
L374128	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh yes, he's pretty good.
L374116	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
L374115	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
L374114	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
L374113	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
L373968	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
L373967	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
L373966	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
L373965	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh...around...why?
L373964	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Hey, where you been?
L373963	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok.
L373962	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Take a drink!
L373913	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
L373912	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
L373911	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Yes, you did.
L373910	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
L373909	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	No you weren't.
L373908	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	About that shooting last night...I was there and...
L373907	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
L373906	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Uncle, how are you feeling?
L374150	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
L374149	u6538	m434	MARIO	Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
L374131	u6538	m434	MARIO	Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
L374130	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
L374124	u6538	m434	MARIO	Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
L374123	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.
L374122	u6538	m434	MARIO	Wha?
L374121	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Francis Macomber.
L374120	u6538	m434	MARIO	No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
L374119	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nothing.
L374118	u6538	m434	MARIO	What was it?
L374117	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Wasn't a book...was a short story.
L374242	u6542	m434	TERESA	For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
L374241	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
L374214	u6542	m434	TERESA	But...
L374213	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
L374212	u6542	m434	TERESA	Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
L374211	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
L374073	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
L374072	u6542	m434	TERESA	The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
L373947	u6542	m434	TERESA	The green capsules in the top drawer.
L373946	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
L373945	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'm sleepy.
L373944	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
L373943	u6542	m434	TERESA	Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
L373942	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
L373938	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I know...I know.
L373937	u6542	m434	TERESA	I can take care of myself.  You know that.
L373936	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well you can't blame them in a way.
L373935	u6542	m434	TERESA	You know why...with my parents.
L373934	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
L373933	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
L373931	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Watch your language.
L373930	u6542	m434	TERESA	You're intolerable today.
L373929	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That W.A.S.P. bastard.
L373928	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
L373927	u6542	m434	TERESA	Sure...He lives there?
L373926	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
L373924	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's the word...preoccupied.
L373923	u6542	m434	TERESA	I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
L373922	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Take your time.  I don't care.
L373921	u6542	m434	TERESA	It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
L373920	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
L373919	u6542	m434	TERESA	A paper on that one too?
L373918	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Bore.
L373917	u6542	m434	TERESA	Ok.
L373916	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
L373915	u6542	m434	TERESA	C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
L373862	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
L373861	u6542	m434	TERESA	It's still sick.
L373860	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
L373859	u6542	m434	TERESA	It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
L373858	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
L373857	u6542	m434	TERESA	No.
L373856	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Did you?
L373855	u6542	m434	TERESA	Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
L373854	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't ask.
L373853	u6542	m434	TERESA	What is it now?
L373852	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
L373851	u6542	m434	TERESA	Anything specific?
L373850	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
L373849	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nobody knows anything, believe me.
L373848	u6542	m434	TERESA	Charlie...?
L373847	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Maybe, who knows.
L373846	u6542	m434	TERESA	An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
L373845	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
L373844	u6542	m434	TERESA	It's all right.
L373843	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Sure...it's not that...I mean...
L373842	u6542	m434	TERESA	I don't mind.
L373841	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well...
L373840	u6542	m434	TERESA	Please take it.
L373839	u6542	m434	TERESA	Here.
L373838	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
L373837	u6542	m434	TERESA	Do you have enough?
L373836	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok, we'll go for lunch.
L373835	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.

L385080	u6604	m440	JEREMY	Hey, you can't...
L385123	u6605	m440	JOSH	Take a look.
L385122	u6608	m440	PETER	Weird shit...?
L385121	u6605	m440	JOSH	There's some weird shit here.
L385120	u6608	m440	PETER	Yeah...?
L385119	u6605	m440	JOSH	Peter...
L384942	u6605	m440	JOSH	Shit.
L384941	u6608	m440	PETER	There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
L384897	u6605	m440	JOSH	Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
L384896	u6608	m440	PETER	Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
L384894	u6608	m440	PETER	Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
L384893	u6605	m440	JOSH	Immigration's gonna love you for that.
L384892	u6608	m440	PETER	Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
L384847	u6605	m440	JOSH	Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
L384846	u6608	m440	PETER	You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
L384844	u6608	m440	PETER	"Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell ""Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"""
L384843	u6605	m440	JOSH	Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
L384842	u6608	m440	PETER	Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
L384841	u6605	m440	JOSH	"The blintzes!  ""Try the blintzes..."""
L385149	u6605	m440	JOSH	Right.
L385148	u6606	m440	LEONARD	And a right.
L385147	u6605	m440	JOSH	I think so. One right, two lefts...
L385146	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
L385145	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
L385144	u6605	m440	JOSH	H-how do I get...?
L385143	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
L385111	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
L385110	u6605	m440	JOSH	What?
L385109	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
L385099	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
L385098	u6605	m440	JOSH	There's really people living down here?
L385097	u6605	m440	JOSH	New York's finest.
L385096	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
L385315	u6608	m440	PETER	Go!! Just go!!
L385314	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What do you-?
L385313	u6608	m440	PETER	The kid's with them!!
L385312	u6606	m440	LEONARD	The kid...
L385273	u6608	m440	PETER	Depends.  You got a memo?
L385272	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
L385256	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
L385255	u6608	m440	PETER	Can we get this car there?
L385231	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
L385230	u6608	m440	PETER	Is there a switch?
L385213	u6606	m440	LEONARD	How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
L385212	u6608	m440	PETER	It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
L385211	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Mistake?  What's that supposed to...?
L385210	u6608	m440	PETER	A mistake.
L385208	u6608	m440	PETER	I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
L385207	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
L385206	u6608	m440	PETER	Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
L385205	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
L385204	u6608	m440	PETER	You feel anything?
L385197	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, Jesus!!
L385196	u6608	m440	PETER	Its muscles are locked.
L385194	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
L385193	u6608	m440	PETER	Wait a minute-
L385177	u6608	m440	PETER	Just do it!
L385176	u6606	m440	LEONARD	I only got...
L385160	u6606	m440	LEONARD	All right, motherfucker, that's it.
L385159	u6608	m440	PETER	For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
L385158	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
L385157	u6608	m440	PETER	What?
L385156	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, man, there you go again.
L385155	u6608	m440	PETER	You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
L385154	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
L385153	u6608	m440	PETER	Any luck?
L385142	u6608	m440	PETER	You got a better way up?
L385141	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, that's gonna work.
L385136	u6608	m440	PETER	Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
L385135	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Did you see the size of that thing?!
L385108	u6608	m440	PETER	20 minutes.  Susan?
L385107	u6606	m440	LEONARD	20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
L385106	u6608	m440	PETER	We'll be back at the platform in...
L385005	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
L385004	u6608	m440	PETER	For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
L385001	u6606	m440	LEONARD	No, you talkin' at me.
L385000	u6608	m440	PETER	Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
L384993	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
L384992	u6608	m440	PETER	Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
L384991	u6606	m440	LEONARD	...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
L384990	u6608	m440	PETER	The Department of Public Health...
L384989	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
L384988	u6608	m440	PETER	Look, I showed you my badge...
L385297	u6607	m440	MANNY	Nino, please...
L385296	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
L385271	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
L385270	u6607	m440	MANNY	I pull.
L385269	u6606	m440	LEONARD	The lights come up, you pull the switch.
L385191	u6607	m440	MANNY	Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
L385190	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
L385170	u6607	m440	MANNY	Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
L385169	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What are you doing down here?
L385164	u6607	m440	MANNY	Hurry, the woman needs help!
L385163	u6606	m440	LEONARD	My God, what the hell are you...?
L384999	u6606	m440	LEONARD	He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
L384998	u6607	m440	MANNY	He's special.
L385327	u6606	m440	LEONARD	No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
L385326	u6611	m440	SUSAN	We're no leaving you!
L385323	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Across both tracks!!
L385322	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Which way?
L385318	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
L385317	u6611	m440	SUSAN	What?
L385316	u6606	m440	LEONARD	He didn't do it!
L385262	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
L385261	u6606	m440	LEONARD	It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
L385258	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
L385257	u6611	m440	SUSAN	But the power...
L385252	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
L385251	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What are you putting that crap on me for?
L385278	u6611	m440	SUSAN	We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
L385277	u6607	m440	MANNY	I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
L385276	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Manny...
L385275	u6607	m440	MANNY	He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
L385226	u6611	m440	SUSAN	This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
L385225	u6607	m440	MANNY	...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ...
L385224	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
L385217	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No...
L385216	u6607	m440	MANNY	But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
L385215	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Just inner chambers...
L385352	u6608	m440	PETER	We can do it!
L385351	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No...
L385345	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Peter...
L385344	u6608	m440	PETER	Talk to me.
L385343	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Ah...
L385342	u6608	m440	PETER	C'mon...
L385339	u6608	m440	PETER	I can.  We can do this...
L385338	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Your arm, you can't...
L385337	u6608	m440	PETER	You go first. I'll be right below you.
L385336	u6608	m440	PETER	Jump in.
L385335	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Oh, come on, come on!
L385286	u6611	m440	SUSAN	That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
L385285	u6608	m440	PETER	I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
L385281	u6608	m440	PETER	Try not to sweat?
L385280	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
L385267	u6608	m440	PETER	That's why we should do it now.
L385266	u6611	m440	SUSAN	The scent won't last...
L385265	u6608	m440	PETER	It worked before...
L385264	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Peter-
L385263	u6608	m440	PETER	We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
L385250	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Just do it!!
L385249	u6608	m440	PETER	What-
L385248	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Rub it on the windows!
L385243	u6608	m440	PETER	Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
L385242	u6611	m440	SUSAN	They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
L385241	u6608	m440	PETER	It's no use! They know we're in here!
L385240	u6608	m440	PETER	How?!
L385239	u6611	m440	SUSAN	His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
L385220	u6611	m440	SUSAN	That's camouflage...
L385219	u6608	m440	PETER	So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
L385175	u6608	m440	PETER	Toss the flare down!
L385174	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No, Jesus, no.
L385167	u6608	m440	PETER	Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
L385166	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Don't.
L385103	u6608	m440	PETER	Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
L385102	u6611	m440	SUSAN	It's me. Can you hear me?
L385059	u6608	m440	PETER	I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
L385058	u6611	m440	SUSAN	It didn't bite me.
L385057	u6608	m440	PETER	Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
L385056	u6608	m440	PETER	No.
L385055	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
L385054	u6608	m440	PETER	You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
L385053	u6611	m440	SUSAN	...you don't even know what you're looking for.
L385040	u6608	m440	PETER	Susan, we're not b-
L385039	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
L385038	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I was just late.
L385037	u6608	m440	PETER	Oh, no, you were-
L385034	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Right.
L385033	u6608	m440	PETER	Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
L385032	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
L385031	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No such thing, baby.
L385030	u6608	m440	PETER	Great crowd.
L385010	u6608	m440	PETER	Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
L385009	u6611	m440	SUSAN	He was just doing his job.
L385008	u6608	m440	PETER	Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
L385007	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I heard how you talked to him.
L385006	u6608	m440	PETER	You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
L384985	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No, there's...
L384984	u6608	m440	PETER	Honey, just leave it.
L384965	u6608	m440	PETER	So?
L384964	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Metaxonycha Godmani.
L384960	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
L384959	u6608	m440	PETER	Maybe they lied to you.
L384958	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
L384953	u6608	m440	PETER	We?
L384952	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
L384950	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Don't you get it? It's more than that.
L384949	u6608	m440	PETER	Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
L384948	u6611	m440	SUSAN	This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
L384947	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
L384946	u6608	m440	PETER	Thought it was my week for that.
L384837	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I'll be late.
L384836	u6608	m440	PETER	Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
L384835	u6608	m440	PETER	Don't get kinky here...
L384834	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
L384831	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
L384830	u6608	m440	PETER	You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
L384816	u6611	m440	SUSAN	"We're down to a ""couple"" now, huh?"
L384815	u6608	m440	PETER	Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
L384809	u6608	m440	PETER	Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
L384808	u6611	m440	SUSAN	We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
L384807	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You know what I mean...
L384806	u6608	m440	PETER	Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
L384805	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Do you think we did the right thing?
L384804	u6608	m440	PETER	You did!
L384803	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Please.
L384802	u6608	m440	PETER	A shame.  You looked great tonight.
L384973	u6609	m440	RICKY	No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
L384972	u6611	m440	SUSAN	"An ""Ootheca"". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh ""weirdbugs"" inside."
L384971	u6609	m440	RICKY	Gross. What is it?
L384970	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You sure you didn't see one of these?
L384879	u6609	m440	RICKY	That's it?
L384878	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
L384870	u6609	m440	RICKY	You the bug lady, right?
L384869	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Hello.
L384920	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I know.  Help me get a sample.
L384919	u6610	m440	SIRI	That's impossible.  Insects don't...
L384917	u6610	m440	SIRI	What?
L384916	u6611	m440	SUSAN	My God.
L384915	u6611	m440	SUSAN	And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
L384914	u6610	m440	SIRI	Fuck! It broke the skin...
L384913	u6611	m440	SUSAN	This wing configuration. I've never...
L384912	u6610	m440	SIRI	No shit.
L384911	u6611	m440	SUSAN	It bit you.
L384908	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I have no idea.  Are you ready?
L384907	u6610	m440	SIRI	What is it?
L384906	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
L384868	u6610	m440	SIRI	Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
L384867	u6611	m440	SUSAN	What's this?
L384864	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Oh, Jesus.
L384863	u6610	m440	SIRI	Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
L384862	u6610	m440	SIRI	She used a baster.
L384861	u6611	m440	SUSAN	What?
L384860	u6610	m440	SIRI	I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
L384859	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
L384858	u6610	m440	SIRI	I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
L384857	u6611	m440	SUSAN	...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
L384839	u6610	m440	SIRI	Just like Trump Tower, then.
L384838	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
L416759	u6878	m460	JESSE	Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
L416758	u6875	m460	DAD	Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
L416756	u6878	m460	JESSE	And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
L416755	u6875	m460	DAD	I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
L416744	u6875	m460	DAD	You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
L416743	u6878	m460	JESSE	What are you talking about?
L416742	u6875	m460	DAD	You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
L416734	u6875	m460	DAD	Don't tell me it's not the gas!
L416733	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's not the gas, Dad!
L416732	u6875	m460	DAD	Help me with this thing!
L416688	u6875	m460	DAD	No.  Upstairs.
L416687	u6878	m460	JESSE	Oh, come on Dad...
L416686	u6875	m460	DAD	I told you I want that room unpacked.
L416685	u6878	m460	JESSE	Just out for a while.
L416684	u6875	m460	DAD	Where are you going?
L416612	u6875	m460	DAD	Who's Lisa?
L416611	u6878	m460	JESSE	That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
L416606	u6875	m460	DAD	Don't be a smart ass.
L416605	u6878	m460	JESSE	Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
L416604	u6875	m460	DAD	I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
L416594	u6875	m460	DAD	We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
L416593	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's getting there.
L416592	u6875	m460	DAD	You got your room straightened out yet?
L416865	u6881	m460	MOM	I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
L416864	u6875	m460	DAD	Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
L416863	u6881	m460	MOM	He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
L416747	u6881	m460	MOM	Ken!
L416746	u6875	m460	DAD	Come back here!
L416739	u6875	m460	DAD	What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
L416738	u6881	m460	MOM	Oh, please...
L416737	u6875	m460	DAD	Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
L416736	u6881	m460	MOM	I wasn't sure, Ken...
L416735	u6875	m460	DAD	Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
L417039	u6876	m460	FREDDY	He'll die with me!
L417038	u6880	m460	LISA	He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
L417037	u6876	m460	FREDDY	I'll kill you now.
L417036	u6876	m460	FREDDY	He's dead, you bitch.
L417035	u6880	m460	LISA	I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
L417033	u6876	m460	FREDDY	Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
L417032	u6880	m460	LISA	I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
L417029	u6880	m460	LISA	I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
L417028	u6876	m460	FREDDY	There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
L417027	u6880	m460	LISA	Where's Jesse?
L417026	u6876	m460	FREDDY	Wanna join your little friend?
L417024	u6876	m460	FREDDY	Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
L417023	u6880	m460	LISA	Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
L417000	u6876	m460	FREDDY	I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
L416999	u6880	m460	LISA	Jesse, help!
L416962	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's happening again.
L416961	u6877	m460	GRADY	What?
L416950	u6878	m460	JESSE	Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
L416949	u6877	m460	GRADY	Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
L416948	u6878	m460	JESSE	No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
L416947	u6877	m460	GRADY	I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
L416946	u6878	m460	JESSE	Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
L416945	u6877	m460	GRADY	The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
L416944	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
L416943	u6877	m460	GRADY	You're fucked in the head.
L416937	u6878	m460	JESSE	Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
L416936	u6877	m460	GRADY	Are you nuts or something?
L416935	u6878	m460	JESSE	You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
L416934	u6877	m460	GRADY	What are you doing here?
L416933	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm sorry...
L416932	u6877	m460	GRADY	Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
L416893	u6878	m460	JESSE	Shut up, Grady.
L416892	u6877	m460	GRADY	You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
L416879	u6877	m460	GRADY	He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
L416878	u6878	m460	JESSE	Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
L416797	u6877	m460	GRADY	Only the wet ones.
L416796	u6878	m460	JESSE	You remember your dreams, Grady?
L416795	u6878	m460	JESSE	Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
L416794	u6877	m460	GRADY	Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
L416793	u6878	m460	JESSE	Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
L416792	u6877	m460	GRADY	No shit.
L416791	u6878	m460	JESSE	My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
L416790	u6877	m460	GRADY	Who told you to choke up that way?
L416789	u6878	m460	JESSE	It was okay.
L416788	u6877	m460	GRADY	You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
L416654	u6877	m460	GRADY	They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
L416653	u6878	m460	JESSE	What the hell are you talking about?
L416652	u6877	m460	GRADY	Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
L416651	u6878	m460	JESSE	Yeah, why?
L416650	u6877	m460	GRADY	Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
L416649	u6878	m460	JESSE	Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
L416648	u6877	m460	GRADY	So, you live around here.
L416646	u6877	m460	GRADY	Naw. Just killing time.
L416645	u6878	m460	JESSE	You got a problem with me, Grady?
L416644	u6877	m460	GRADY	She giving you any carfare for the ride?
L416643	u6878	m460	JESSE	She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
L416642	u6877	m460	GRADY	You two got a thing going, or what?
L416641	u6878	m460	JESSE	What about it?
L416640	u6877	m460	GRADY	So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
L416639	u6878	m460	JESSE	Get outa here.
L416638	u6877	m460	GRADY	Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
L416637	u6878	m460	JESSE	How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
L417044	u6880	m460	LISA	We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
L417043	u6878	m460	JESSE	What's so funny?
L417042	u6880	m460	LISA	Hi.
L417041	u6878	m460	JESSE	Hi.
L416990	u6878	m460	JESSE	I can't!
L416989	u6880	m460	LISA	You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
L416975	u6880	m460	LISA	No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
L416974	u6878	m460	JESSE	Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
L416973	u6880	m460	LISA	Who?  Who's doing this to you?
L416972	u6878	m460	JESSE	he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
L416971	u6880	m460	LISA	Who, Jesse?
L416970	u6878	m460	JESSE	I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
L416969	u6880	m460	LISA	Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
L416968	u6878	m460	JESSE	I killed him!  I killed him!
L416967	u6880	m460	LISA	Jesse, God - what happened?
L416925	u6880	m460	LISA	We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
L416924	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
L416922	u6878	m460	JESSE	What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
L416921	u6880	m460	LISA	You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
L416920	u6878	m460	JESSE	Will you leave me alone?  Please.
L416919	u6880	m460	LISA	Why won't you talk to me?
L416918	u6878	m460	JESSE	I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
L416891	u6878	m460	JESSE	There's nothing to figure out.
L416890	u6880	m460	LISA	I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
L416889	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm not hungry.
L416888	u6880	m460	LISA	You should eat something - you'll feel better.
L416874	u6878	m460	JESSE	My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
L416873	u6880	m460	LISA	You want to talk about it?
L416872	u6878	m460	JESSE	yeah, I had a bad night.
L416871	u6880	m460	LISA	you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
L416870	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
L416869	u6880	m460	LISA	Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
L416848	u6880	m460	LISA	Oh, Jesse...
L416847	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's gone now.
L416846	u6878	m460	JESSE	I don't know - a sharp pain.
L416845	u6880	m460	LISA	What is it?
L416844	u6878	m460	JESSE	Whoa!
L416843	u6880	m460	LISA	What is it - What's wrong?
L416842	u6880	m460	LISA	Ghostbusters are fearless.
L416841	u6878	m460	JESSE	Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?

L417328	u6889	m461	NANCY	We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
L417327	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
L417326	u6889	m461	NANCY	You like gymnastics?

L417177	u6889	m461	NANCY	It's an amazing gift.
L417176	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
L417175	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
L417174	u6889	m461	NANCY	Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
L417173	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.

L417307	u6893	m461	TARYN	I don't do that shit.
L417306	u6887	m461	LORENZO	The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
L417305	u6893	m461	TARYN	What?
L417304	u6887	m461	LORENZO	So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
L417303	u6893	m461	TARYN	So?
L417302	u6887	m461	LORENZO	Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
L417301	u6893	m461	TARYN	Can't be good news coming from you.
L417300	u6887	m461	LORENZO	Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
L417510	u6889	m461	NANCY	Thank you.
L417509	u6888	m461	MAX	You got five minutes.
L417508	u6889	m461	NANCY	It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
L417507	u6888	m461	MAX	I don't know...
L417504	u6889	m461	NANCY	But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
L417503	u6888	m461	MAX	Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
L417299	u6889	m461	NANCY	Thanks, Max.
L417298	u6888	m461	MAX	You need me, I'll be here all night.
L417295	u6888	m461	MAX	Restless.  Very restless.
L417294	u6889	m461	NANCY	I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
L417293	u6888	m461	MAX	Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
L417171	u6888	m461	MAX	She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
L417170	u6889	m461	NANCY	Max, where's Kristen?
L417130	u6889	m461	NANCY	Why is that?
L417129	u6888	m461	MAX	This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
L417128	u6888	m461	MAX	I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
L417127	u6889	m461	NANCY	A little basic, but nice.
L417126	u6888	m461	MAX	The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
L417075	u6888	m461	MAX	Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
L417074	u6890	m461	NEIL	It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
L417073	u6888	m461	MAX	Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
L417072	u6890	m461	NEIL	Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
L417071	u6888	m461	MAX	Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
L417070	u6890	m461	NEIL	Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
L417626	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
L417625	u6889	m461	NANCY	Crossed over?
L417623	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Nancy...
L417622	u6889	m461	NANCY	It's over.  It's over.
L417480	u6889	m461	NANCY	People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
L417479	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
L417478	u6889	m461	NANCY	I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
L417475	u6889	m461	NANCY	You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
L417474	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
L417473	u6889	m461	NANCY	That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
L417472	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
L417471	u6889	m461	NANCY	It's been a long time.
L417470	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
L417493	u6890	m461	NEIL	Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
L417492	u6889	m461	NANCY	Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
L417487	u6889	m461	NANCY	No...
L417486	u6890	m461	NEIL	Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
L417482	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
L417481	u6890	m461	NEIL	Nancy...
L417464	u6889	m461	NANCY	There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
L417463	u6890	m461	NEIL	Who would know where they were hidden?
L417462	u6889	m461	NANCY	They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
L417461	u6890	m461	NEIL	The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
L417460	u6889	m461	NANCY	All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
L417459	u6890	m461	NEIL	I've heard crazier things this week.
L417458	u6889	m461	NANCY	Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
L417457	u6890	m461	NEIL	Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
L417456	u6889	m461	NANCY	Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
L417455	u6890	m461	NEIL	You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
L417437	u6890	m461	NEIL	There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
L417436	u6889	m461	NANCY	What are we going to do?
L417408	u6890	m461	NEIL	Anything?
L417407	u6889	m461	NANCY	Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
L417400	u6890	m461	NEIL	This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
L417399	u6889	m461	NANCY	We made it.  Neil, we made it!
L417391	u6890	m461	NEIL	Everybody take five.
L417390	u6889	m461	NANCY	We can try again.
L417388	u6890	m461	NEIL	Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
L417387	u6889	m461	NANCY	Take us there, Kristen.
L417386	u6890	m461	NEIL	Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
L417385	u6889	m461	NANCY	Remember -- open mind.
L417384	u6890	m461	NEIL	You sound like Peter Pan.
L417360	u6890	m461	NEIL	I can do that.
L417359	u6889	m461	NANCY	Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
L417358	u6890	m461	NEIL	Try me.
L417357	u6889	m461	NANCY	The truth.
L417356	u6890	m461	NEIL	For what?
L417355	u6889	m461	NANCY	Then maybe you're ready.
L417354	u6890	m461	NEIL	I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
L417353	u6889	m461	NANCY	Stop blaming yourself.
L417351	u6889	m461	NANCY	C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
L417350	u6890	m461	NEIL	Doesn't matter.
L417349	u6889	m461	NANCY	To who?
L417291	u6890	m461	NEIL	We're gonna try.
L417290	u6889	m461	NANCY	Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
L417289	u6890	m461	NEIL	I can't believe I just did that.
L417244	u6890	m461	NEIL	I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
L417243	u6889	m461	NANCY	Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
L417242	u6890	m461	NEIL	So do I.
L417241	u6889	m461	NANCY	I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
L417240	u6890	m461	NEIL	Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
L417239	u6889	m461	NANCY	Just until we get things under control.
L417238	u6890	m461	NEIL	You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
L417237	u6889	m461	NANCY	That's right.
L417236	u6890	m461	NEIL	With Hypnocyl?
L417235	u6889	m461	NANCY	All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
L417234	u6890	m461	NEIL	The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
L417233	u6889	m461	NANCY	That's what I know.
L417232	u6890	m461	NEIL	That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
L417231	u6889	m461	NANCY	What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
L417230	u6890	m461	NEIL	Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
L417229	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'm serious.
L417228	u6890	m461	NEIL	I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
L417227	u6889	m461	NANCY	It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
L417226	u6890	m461	NEIL	Sounds like a rough time.
L417225	u6889	m461	NANCY	My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
L417224	u6890	m461	NEIL	Sorry.
L417223	u6889	m461	NANCY	My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
L417222	u6890	m461	NEIL	Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
L417221	u6889	m461	NANCY	Must have opened while I was away at school.
L417220	u6890	m461	NEIL	Never been here before?
L417219	u6889	m461	NANCY	This is nice.
L417202	u6889	m461	NANCY	All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
L417201	u6890	m461	NEIL	Yes, tell us, Nancy.
L417169	u6890	m461	NEIL	Well, we've got --
L417168	u6889	m461	NANCY	Didn't get much sleep.
L417167	u6890	m461	NEIL	You're late.
L417125	u6889	m461	NANCY	Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
L417124	u6890	m461	NEIL	Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
L417123	u6889	m461	NANCY	Call me Nancy.
L417122	u6890	m461	NEIL	Ms. Thompson.
L417120	u6890	m461	NEIL	Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
L417119	u6889	m461	NANCY	Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
L417118	u6890	m461	NEIL	So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
L417117	u6889	m461	NANCY	I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
L417116	u6890	m461	NEIL	What's that supposed to mean?
L417115	u6889	m461	NANCY	I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
L417114	u6890	m461	NEIL	Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
L417113	u6889	m461	NANCY	Oh God.
L417112	u6890	m461	NEIL	We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
L417111	u6889	m461	NANCY	Anything?
L417110	u6890	m461	NEIL	"Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a ""boogeyman"" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep."
L417109	u6889	m461	NANCY	But nightmares are the common thread?
L417108	u6890	m461	NEIL	You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
L417107	u6889	m461	NANCY	Tell me about the kids.
L417522	u6889	m461	NANCY	We can't get to her.  I've tried.
L417521	u6893	m461	TARYN	What about Kristen?
L417520	u6889	m461	NANCY	Okay, straight talk only in here.
L417512	u6889	m461	NANCY	Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
L417511	u6893	m461	TARYN	What'd you do, take the scenic route?
L417370	u6889	m461	NANCY	Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
L417369	u6893	m461	TARYN	Who is he?
L417192	u6893	m461	TARYN	Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
L417191	u6889	m461	NANCY	Your dreams?
L417190	u6893	m461	TARYN	I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
L417282	u6889	m461	NANCY	Neil, please --
L417281	u6892	m461	SIMMS	That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
L417280	u6889	m461	NANCY	You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
L417279	u6892	m461	SIMMS	We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
L417198	u6892	m461	SIMMS	The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
L417197	u6889	m461	NANCY	And what are they?
L417196	u6892	m461	SIMMS	And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
L417605	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	No.  We're alone.
L417604	u6890	m461	NEIL	Somebody else is out here.
L417603	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Listen.
L417602	u6890	m461	NEIL	What?
L417601	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	What was that?
L417535	u6890	m461	NEIL	You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
L417534	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	What are you talking about?
L417533	u6890	m461	NEIL	We've got work to do.
L417517	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	They used to keep a spare key.
L417516	u6890	m461	NEIL	How do we get in?
L417515	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
L417450	u6891	m461	NUN	You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
L417449	u6890	m461	NEIL	You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
L417448	u6891	m461	NUN	The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
L417447	u6890	m461	NEIL	Freddy.
L417446	u6891	m461	NUN	That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
L417445	u6890	m461	NEIL	My God.
L417444	u6891	m461	NUN	A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
L417443	u6890	m461	NEIL	The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
L417442	u6891	m461	NUN	Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
L417441	u6890	m461	NEIL	This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
L417346	u6890	m461	NEIL	I beg your pardon?
L417345	u6891	m461	NUN	Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
L417344	u6890	m461	NEIL	I could've saved them.
L417343	u6891	m461	NUN	I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
L417342	u6890	m461	NEIL	You do volunteer work at the hospital?
L417341	u6891	m461	NUN	Mary Helena.
L417340	u6890	m461	NEIL	There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
L417339	u6891	m461	NUN	A sad choice.
L417338	u6890	m461	NEIL	Science...I suppose.
L417435	u6892	m461	SIMMS	Of course.
L417434	u6890	m461	NEIL	For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
L417433	u6892	m461	SIMMS	I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
L417287	u6890	m461	NEIL	I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
L417286	u6892	m461	SIMMS	I won't allow it.
L417285	u6890	m461	NEIL	Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
L417284	u6892	m461	SIMMS	I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
L417283	u6890	m461	NEIL	Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
L417273	u6892	m461	SIMMS	There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
L417272	u6890	m461	NEIL	That's enough, Kincaid.
L417181	u6892	m461	SIMMS	Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
L417180	u6890	m461	NEIL	Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
L417093	u6890	m461	NEIL	Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
L417092	u6892	m461	SIMMS	She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
L417091	u6890	m461	NEIL	Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
L417090	u6892	m461	SIMMS	What did you think?
L417087	u6890	m461	NEIL	Don't worry, it won't come to that.
L417086	u6892	m461	SIMMS	If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
L417085	u6890	m461	NEIL	Cooling down.
L417084	u6892	m461	SIMMS	How is he?
L417526	u6893	m461	TARYN	Me too.
L417525	u6895	m461	WILL	I'm in.
L417395	u6893	m461	TARYN	Where...here?
L417394	u6895	m461	WILL	We're here.
L417375	u6893	m461	TARYN	"Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  ""Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."""
L417374	u6895	m461	WILL	Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
L417372	u6893	m461	TARYN	Yeah?  What did we ever do?
L417371	u6895	m461	WILL	Why is he after us?
L417211	u6893	m461	TARYN	I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
L417210	u6895	m461	WILL	Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
L417209	u6893	m461	TARYN	In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
L417208	u6895	m461	WILL	C'mon.
L417207	u6893	m461	TARYN	This is stupid.
L417206	u6895	m461	WILL	Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
L417205	u6893	m461	TARYN	Uh, fourteen.
L417204	u6895	m461	WILL	Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
L417184	u6893	m461	TARYN	Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
L417183	u6895	m461	WILL	I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
L432327	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I do not joke in my proposal.
L432326	u6968	m466	BOB	Leave her alone, I tell you!
L432325	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
L432324	u6968	m466	BOB	If I could get my hands on you...
L432323	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
L432322	u6968	m466	BOB	Leave her alone, you fiend!
L432391	u6968	m466	BOB	Of course I do.
L432390	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	You love me then?
L432389	u6968	m466	BOB	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
L432388	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
L432339	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Maybe so.
L432338	u6968	m466	BOB	<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
L432337	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
L432336	u6968	m466	BOB	All right.  Put it on heavy.
L432335	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
L432334	u6968	m466	BOB	I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
L432333	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What can we do against them?
L432332	u6968	m466	BOB	I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
L432311	u6968	m466	BOB	...And I thought you loved me.
L432310	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
L432309	u6968	m466	BOB	That sudden?
L432308	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I should hope not.  I hate you!
L432307	u6968	m466	BOB	They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
L432306	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
L432305	u6968	m466	BOB	You're talking nonsense.
L432304	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Yes I feel it in my bones.
L432303	u6968	m466	BOB	You do?
L432302	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
L432301	u6968	m466	BOB	Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
L432300	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
L432299	u6968	m466	BOB	My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
L432298	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Nothing is worth your life.
L432297	u6968	m466	BOB	I am--It's our only chance.
L432296	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Be careful!
L432295	u6968	m466	BOB	The ropes are coming loose.
L432237	u6968	m466	BOB	Whatever you do, don't do that.
L432236	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm afraid I'll faint.
L432235	u6968	m466	BOB	Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
L432234	u6968	m466	BOB	I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
L432233	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What can we do?
L432232	u6968	m466	BOB	Don't let them hear you.
L432231	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Those creatures..!
L432230	u6968	m466	BOB	You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
L432229	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm so frightened.
L432207	u6968	m466	BOB	Be careful!--They'll see you.
L432206	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Look!
L432204	u6968	m466	BOB	I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
L432203	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What do you mean?
L432202	u6968	m466	BOB	I'm not sure...
L432201	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Can't we get out of here?
L432200	u6968	m466	BOB	It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
L432199	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Could it be some kind of college initiation?
L432198	u6968	m466	BOB	Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
L432197	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
L432196	u6968	m466	BOB	Not dead?  In a cemetery?
L432195	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
L432194	u6968	m466	BOB	All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
L432193	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
L432192	u6968	m466	BOB	Something's making that music.
L432191	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
L432190	u6968	m466	BOB	That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
L432189	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Then..then what's that music?
L432188	u6968	m466	BOB	Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
L432187	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	It frightens me.
L432186	u6968	m466	BOB	In there.
L432185	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Where?
L432184	u6968	m466	BOB	Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
L432171	u6968	m466	BOB	Okay.
L432170	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
L432169	u6968	m466	BOB	There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
L432168	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
L432167	u6968	m466	BOB	All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
L432166	u6968	m466	BOB	Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
L432165	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	That's life.  My kisses are alive.
L432164	u6968	m466	BOB	Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
L432162	u6968	m466	BOB	Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
L432161	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
L432160	u6968	m466	BOB	Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
L432159	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
L432158	u6968	m466	BOB	You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
L432157	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	But does it have to be in a cemetery?
L432156	u6968	m466	BOB	No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
L432155	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
L432376	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
L432375	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
L432374	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You better hope there is.
L432373	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Is there time?
L432372	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You may take her now.
L432371	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	You mean...!
L432370	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Your pleasures of course!
L432369	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	For what!?!
L432368	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	The time...is short.
L432367	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
L432366	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
L432365	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Oh, if there is only time!
L432364	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
L432363	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
L432362	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Then cancel my order.
L432361	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
L432360	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I will decide the conclusion.
L432359	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
L432356	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Well then let us proceed.
L432355	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	There are others.
L432354	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
L432353	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	I understand, Master
L432352	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
L432351	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	I would have time for my own pleasures!
L432350	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
L432349	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
L432348	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, there is yet time.
L432347	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	The moon is almost gone!
L432346	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
L432345	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	When!?
L432344	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, she will be yours.
L432343	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Well?
L432329	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
L432328	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
L432291	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
L432290	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	It would seem so, Master
L432289	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
L432288	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
L432287	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Yes, yes yes I know all that.
L432262	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	As you wish, Master
L432261	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
L432260	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
L432251	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	It would seem so, Master.
L432250	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
L432249	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
L432248	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	She was?
L432246	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Her dance has pleased me.
L432245	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
L432244	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
L432243	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
L432242	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	What kind of symbol?
L432241	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	A symbol, Master.
L432240	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	...And what is this?
L432223	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Tie them that they may watch.
L432222	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	A situation easily remedied.
L432221	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	But they are not yet one of us.
L432294	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Yes, sir, Master.
L432293	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
L432292	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
L432284	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
L432283	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Then it is some service you desire of us.
L432282	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Aaaahhhh.
L432281	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
L432280	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
L432279	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Then why do you shake so?
L432278	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	We don't know of anything, Master...
L432277	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You know better than that.
L432276	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
L432218	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
L432217	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Live ones where only the dead should be?
L432216	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Yes, Master.
L432215	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	They are live ones?
L432331	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
L432330	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	No. No! No!
L432321	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
L432320	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
L432319	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
L432318	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
L432183	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm so frightened.
L432182	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
L432342	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Without the snake, of course.
L432341	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
L432340	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	I could make her another Cleopatra...
L432271	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
L432270	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aannnnaahhnn.
L432269	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
L432268	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aannnnaahhnn.
L432267	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
L432266	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
L432265	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	What do you suppose for?
L432264	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
L432263	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	He wants us.
L432259	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaarrrgggaahh.
L432258	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
L432257	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
L432256	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
L432255	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
L432254	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
L432253	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
L432252	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
L440479	u7029	m470	CHASE	My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
L440478	u7036	m470	YOLANDER	Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
L440377	u7029	m470	CHASE	Well... uh... thanks...
L440376	u7036	m470	YOLANDER	You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
L440374	u7029	m470	CHASE	Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
L440373	u7036	m470	YOLANDER	"The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was ""Church"".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?"
L440372	u7029	m470	CHASE	...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
L440371	u7029	m470	CHASE	I... um...
L440370	u7036	m470	YOLANDER	Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
L440490	u7029	m470	CHASE	God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
L440489	u7032	m470	GUS	I was building a doggy door.
L440114	u7029	m470	CHASE	How'd you know that?
L440113	u7032	m470	GUS	I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
L440111	u7032	m470	GUS	--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
L440110	u7029	m470	CHASE	Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
L440108	u7029	m470	CHASE	There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
L440107	u7032	m470	GUS	When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
L440071	u7032	m470	GUS	I suppose so.
L440070	u7029	m470	CHASE	That's Renee alright.
L440068	u7029	m470	CHASE	I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
L440067	u7032	m470	GUS	I hear you moved into town.
L440066	u7029	m470	CHASE	Pretty much so.
L440065	u7032	m470	GUS	Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
L440354	u7035	m470	RUDMAN	Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
L440353	u7029	m470	CHASE	Yes... why?
L440352	u7035	m470	RUDMAN	You took over for Doctor Yolander?
L440351	u7035	m470	RUDMAN	Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
L440350	u7029	m470	CHASE	Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
L440349	u7035	m470	RUDMAN	I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
L440348	u7029	m470	CHASE	What?
L440396	u7029	m470	CHASE	He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
L440395	u7033	m470	MARJORIE	I hope he doesn't have rabies.
L440393	u7033	m470	MARJORIE	You sure did...
L440392	u7029	m470	CHASE	I had a little run-in with Zowie.
L440391	u7033	m470	MARJORIE	What happened to you?
L440273	u7033	m470	MARJORIE	Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
L440272	u7029	m470	CHASE	What do they do up there?
L440271	u7033	m470	MARJORIE	He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
L440270	u7029	m470	CHASE	Out?
L440081	u7029	m470	CHASE	Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
L440080	u7033	m470	MARJORIE	I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
L440079	u7029	m470	CHASE	Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
L440078	u7033	m470	MARJORIE	Is something wrong?
L440529	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Anywhere but here.
L440528	u7029	m470	CHASE	So where're we going?
L440527	u7029	m470	CHASE	All set.
L440526	u7031	m470	GEOFF	All set?
L440460	u7031	m470	GEOFF	He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
L440459	u7029	m470	CHASE	Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
L440458	u7031	m470	GEOFF	I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
L440457	u7029	m470	CHASE	What are you talking about?
L440451	u7031	m470	GEOFF	I'm not hungry.
L440450	u7029	m470	CHASE	Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
L440323	u7031	m470	GEOFF	I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
L440322	u7029	m470	CHASE	Out. Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
L440321	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Just out.
L440269	u7031	m470	GEOFF	I'm going out, Dad!
L440268	u7029	m470	CHASE	Hey! Where're you off to?
L440240	u7029	m470	CHASE	Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
L440239	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Who was that?
L440238	u7031	m470	GEOFF	I still can't believe she's dead...
L440237	u7029	m470	CHASE	Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
L440236	u7029	m470	CHASE	I think so.
L440234	u7029	m470	CHASE	You alright?
L440233	u7031	m470	GEOFF	What?
L440170	u7031	m470	GEOFF	It sucked.
L440169	u7029	m470	CHASE	Hey! How was your first day at school?
L440122	u7031	m470	GEOFF	I'll be fine, Dad.
L440121	u7029	m470	CHASE	You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
L440120	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Sure.
L440119	u7029	m470	CHASE	What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
L440093	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
L440092	u7029	m470	CHASE	What's wrong?!
L440090	u7029	m470	CHASE	It's been a few years.
L440089	u7031	m470	GEOFF	How long ago did this guy retire?
L440229	u7032	m470	GUS	Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
L440228	u7030	m470	DREW	Zowie...
L440220	u7030	m470	DREW	I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
L440219	u7032	m470	GUS	Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
L440183	u7030	m470	DREW	Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
L440182	u7032	m470	GUS	Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
L440176	u7030	m470	DREW	Just until he heals up?
L440175	u7032	m470	GUS	Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
L440105	u7030	m470	DREW	Is he gonna be okay?
L440104	u7032	m470	GUS	Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
L440415	u7031	m470	GEOFF	All the time.
L440414	u7030	m470	DREW	You ever think about running away?
L440411	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Go later...
L440410	u7030	m470	DREW	I gotta go back and do my chores...
L440409	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Dies?
L440408	u7030	m470	DREW	I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
L440407	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
L440382	u7030	m470	DREW	I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
L440381	u7031	m470	GEOFF	What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
L440340	u7030	m470	DREW	It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
L440339	u7031	m470	GEOFF	What do you mean?
L440338	u7030	m470	DREW	It's weird...
L440262	u7030	m470	DREW	Maybe it takes a while...
L440261	u7031	m470	GEOFF	How can he not have a heartbeat?
L440260	u7030	m470	DREW	You think he'd believe it if he did?
L440259	u7031	m470	GEOFF	You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
L440249	u7030	m470	DREW	He was dead. You know he was.
L440248	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
L440216	u7030	m470	DREW	Yeah...
L440215	u7031	m470	GEOFF	It's getting pretty late. We better go.
L440214	u7031	m470	GEOFF	You never get over it.
L440213	u7030	m470	DREW	I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
L440211	u7030	m470	DREW	You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
L440210	u7031	m470	GEOFF	You want me to help?
L440207	u7030	m470	DREW	Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
L440206	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
L440205	u7030	m470	DREW	What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
L440204	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
L440203	u7030	m470	DREW	The old Indian burial ground.
L440202	u7031	m470	GEOFF	What did?
L440201	u7030	m470	DREW	This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
L440197	u7030	m470	DREW	There's a better place...
L440196	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Why not?
L440195	u7030	m470	DREW	I'm not burying him here...
L440194	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Is this a good spot?
L440168	u7030	m470	DREW	Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
L440167	u7031	m470	GEOFF	What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
L440166	u7030	m470	DREW	Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
L440165	u7031	m470	GEOFF	You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
L440164	u7030	m470	DREW	I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
L440162	u7030	m470	DREW	Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
L440161	u7031	m470	GEOFF	He pissed me off.
L440160	u7030	m470	DREW	I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
L440103	u7030	m470	DREW	Zowie.
L440102	u7031	m470	GEOFF	What's his name?
L440505	u7034	m470	RENEE	I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
L440504	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Mom...
L440029	u7034	m470	RENEE	You know everything, don't you?
L440028	u7031	m470	GEOFF	I know, Mom.
L440026	u7034	m470	RENEE	I miss him too...
L440025	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
L440024	u7034	m470	RENEE	How did it go with your father last night?
L440023	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
L440022	u7034	m470	RENEE	How long have you been here?
L440021	u7031	m470	GEOFF	Right here, Mom...
L440020	u7034	m470	RENEE	Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
L454272	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
L454271	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
L454270	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
L454269	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
L454268	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. I told you, she's confined...
L454267	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
L454266	u7177	m482	NORMAN	That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
L454265	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
L454264	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
L454263	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
L454262	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Now, look...!
L454261	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	If she paid you well?
L454260	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Of course not.
L454259	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
L454258	u7177	m482	NORMAN	She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
L454257	u7177	m482	NORMAN	My mother.
L454256	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Someone is sitting in that window.
L454255	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I live there. Alone.
L454254	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Anyone at home?
L454253	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
L454251	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
L454250	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
L454249	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Not at all!
L454248	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She isn't still here, is she?
L454247	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
L454246	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
L454245	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
L454244	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	And when she left, she never came back.
L454243	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Cash.
L454242	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Cash or check? For the cabin...
L454241	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What?
L454240	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	How did she pay you?
L454239	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
L454238	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	"You said she was sitting ""back there,"" or standing rather..."
L454237	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What do you mean?
L454236	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Back where?
L454235	u7177	m482	NORMAN	She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
L454234	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	How do you know she didn't make a call?
L454233	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No! Of all...
L454232	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
L454231	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No.
L454230	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
L454229	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No.
L454228	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Or arrived with her.
L454227	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No.
L454226	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	No one met her?
L454225	u7177	m482	NORMAN	The following morning. Sunday.
L454224	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Of which morning?
L454223	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Very early. Dawn.
L454222	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	How early?
L454221	u7177	m482	NORMAN	She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
L454220	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Tell me all about her.
L454219	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
L454218	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
L454217	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	"Don't know where she got ""Marie,"" but ""Samuels"" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?"
L454214	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
L454213	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What?
L454212	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
L454210	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
L454209	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
L454208	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. At least I don't recall.
L454207	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Look at the picture. Please.
L454206	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
L454205	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
L454204	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
L454203	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
L454202	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh.
L454201	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I'm not the police.
L454200	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
L454199	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
L454198	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
L454197	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	No.
L454196	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You out to buy a motel?
L454195	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
L454194	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
L454193	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
L454192	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
L454191	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
L454167	u7180	m482	SAM	I don't believe it.  Do you?
L454166	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
L454165	u7180	m482	SAM	Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
L454154	u7180	m482	SAM	What are you talking about?  What is this?
L454153	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Must've needed it.
L454152	u7180	m482	SAM	Why?
L454151	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
L454150	u7180	m482	SAM	Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
L454149	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Money.
L454148	u7180	m482	SAM	What's your interest?
L454145	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
L454144	u7180	m482	SAM	Who are you, friend?
L454143	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Let's all talk about Mary.
L454164	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
L454163	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
L454162	u7173	m482	LILA	Not even a hunch. Just hope.
L454161	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
L454159	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, if she's here...
L454158	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Casharoonie!
L454157	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
L454156	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
L454147	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
L454146	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't know.
L453978	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Okay. If you'll come along...
L453977	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
L453976	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
L453975	u7175	m482	MARY	But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
L453974	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
L453973	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
L453972	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
L453971	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
L453970	u7175	m482	MARY	I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
L453969	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
L453968	u7175	m482	MARY	All right.
L453967	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
L453966	u7175	m482	MARY	Five hundred.
L453965	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
L453964	u7175	m482	MARY	Of course not. Please.
L453963	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
L453962	u7175	m482	MARY	It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
L453961	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
L453960	u7175	m482	MARY	How much?
L453959	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
L453957	u7175	m482	MARY	No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
L453956	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
L453955	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
L453954	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
L453953	u7175	m482	MARY	Can I trade in my car and take another?
L453952	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	"There's an old saying, ""First customer of the day is always the most trouble!"" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me..."
L453951	u7175	m482	MARY	What?
L453950	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I'm in no mood for trouble!
L453924	u7175	m482	MARY	I don't need pills... just sleep.
L453923	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
L453897	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
L453896	u7175	m482	MARY	Were there any calls?
L453895	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
L453894	u7175	m482	MARY	It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
L453893	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
L453892	u7175	m482	MARY	Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
L453992	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
L453991	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
L453990	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
L453989	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
L453988	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	Buzz me the minute she comes in.
L453987	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
L453986	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
L453985	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	Yes, Mr. Lowery.
L454413	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't know.
L454412	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
L454411	u7173	m482	LILA	I still feel...
L454408	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Just what he told your detective.
L454407	u7173	m482	LILA	Did he say anything about my sister?
L454383	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
L454382	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454379	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
L454378	u7173	m482	LILA	What difference does that...
L454377	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
L454373	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
L454372	u7173	m482	LILA	Please!
L454359	u7173	m482	LILA	He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
L454358	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
L454357	u7173	m482	LILA	Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
L454356	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Like what?
L454355	u7173	m482	LILA	He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
L454354	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	With the forty thousand dollars?
L454353	u7173	m482	LILA	Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
L454350	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	And the police haven't been able to...
L454349	u7173	m482	LILA	Forty thousand dollars.
L454348	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	A lot?
L454347	u7173	m482	LILA	She stole some money.
L454344	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
L454343	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454340	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
L454339	u7173	m482	LILA	She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
L454338	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Now. Your sister is missing how long?
L454337	u7173	m482	LILA	Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
L454522	u7173	m482	LILA	I could stand something regular.
L454521	u7180	m482	SAM	It's regular. Okay?
L454483	u7180	m482	SAM	Bates.
L454482	u7173	m482	LILA	Why not?
L454481	u7180	m482	SAM	You can't go up there.
L454480	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
L454479	u7180	m482	SAM	Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
L454478	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
L454477	u7180	m482	SAM	Bates never denied Mary was here.
L454476	u7173	m482	LILA	That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
L454475	u7173	m482	LILA	It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
L454474	u7180	m482	SAM	What is it?
L454473	u7173	m482	LILA	The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
L454472	u7180	m482	SAM	What?
L454471	u7173	m482	LILA	Hospital clean.
L454470	u7180	m482	SAM	Sorry.
L454466	u7173	m482	LILA	Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
L454465	u7180	m482	SAM	What makes you sound so certain?
L454464	u7173	m482	LILA	There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
L454463	u7180	m482	SAM	How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
L454462	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
L454461	u7180	m482	SAM	I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
L454460	u7173	m482	LILA	We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
L454459	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm glad we didn't.
L454458	u7173	m482	LILA	We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
L454441	u7173	m482	LILA	Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
L454440	u7180	m482	SAM	I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
L454439	u7173	m482	LILA	I believe it.
L454438	u7180	m482	SAM	You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
L454437	u7173	m482	LILA	We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
L454436	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
L454435	u7173	m482	LILA	You going to wait here for me?
L454434	u7180	m482	SAM	She always tries to be proper.
L454433	u7173	m482	LILA	Huh?
L454432	u7180	m482	SAM	Watch your tenses.
L454431	u7173	m482	LILA	I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
L454430	u7180	m482	SAM	This is the old highway.
L454429	u7173	m482	LILA	Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
L454428	u7180	m482	SAM	We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
L454427	u7173	m482	LILA	I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
L454426	u7180	m482	SAM	She was willing to lick the stamps.
L454425	u7173	m482	LILA	I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
L454424	u7180	m482	SAM	Where'd you go to college?
L454422	u7173	m482	LILA	Alive.
L454421	u7180	m482	SAM	Of course we will.
L454420	u7173	m482	LILA	I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
L454419	u7180	m482	SAM	Neither will I.
L454418	u7173	m482	LILA	I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
L454416	u7173	m482	LILA	You're not.
L454415	u7180	m482	SAM	Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
L454367	u7173	m482	LILA	All right! Then call! At least, call!
L454366	u7180	m482	SAM	I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
L454330	u7180	m482	SAM	This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
L454329	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454328	u7180	m482	SAM	I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
L454327	u7173	m482	LILA	No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
L454319	u7180	m482	SAM	No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
L454318	u7173	m482	LILA	Does that mean we can't...
L454317	u7180	m482	SAM	Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
L454316	u7173	m482	LILA	Well?
L454315	u7180	m482	SAM	Our Deputy sleeps.
L454314	u7180	m482	SAM	He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
L454313	u7173	m482	LILA	Who's he?
L454312	u7180	m482	SAM	Let's go see Al Chambers.
L454311	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes. I think he would have.
L454310	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
L454309	u7180	m482	SAM	In a hurry.
L454308	u7173	m482	LILA	Without calling me?
L454307	u7180	m482	SAM	Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
L454306	u7173	m482	LILA	Where could he have gone?
L454305	u7180	m482	SAM	No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
L454304	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam.
L454303	u7180	m482	SAM	He didn't come back here?
L454301	u7180	m482	SAM	Contemplate your... panic button.
L454300	u7173	m482	LILA	Just wait here?
L454299	u7180	m482	SAM	I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
L454298	u7173	m482	LILA	Why can't I go out there with you?
L454297	u7180	m482	SAM	Stay here.
L454296	u7180	m482	SAM	You'll never find it.
L454295	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, I'm going.
L454294	u7180	m482	SAM	Probably on his way back right now.
L454293	u7180	m482	SAM	And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
L454292	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam! Why call when we can go?
L454291	u7180	m482	SAM	Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
L454290	u7173	m482	LILA	An hour! Or less!
L454289	u7180	m482	SAM	Arbogast said...
L454288	u7173	m482	LILA	Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
L454287	u7180	m482	SAM	That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
L454286	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454285	u7180	m482	SAM	You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
L454284	u7173	m482	LILA	Where's the old highway?
L454283	u7180	m482	SAM	I feel better when you feel better.
L454282	u7173	m482	LILA	Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
L454281	u7180	m482	SAM	Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
L454280	u7173	m482	LILA	You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
L454279	u7180	m482	SAM	He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
L454278	u7173	m482	LILA	Are we just going to go on sitting here?
L454277	u7180	m482	SAM	It's been three.
L454276	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
L454275	u7180	m482	SAM	Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
L454190	u7180	m482	SAM	First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
L454189	u7173	m482	LILA	Where... can I stay?
L454188	u7180	m482	SAM	She'll need both of us.
L454187	u7173	m482	LILA	You want me to stay here?
L454186	u7180	m482	SAM	I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
L454185	u7173	m482	LILA	I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
L454184	u7180	m482	SAM	Maybe we can handle it together. 
L454183	u7173	m482	LILA	No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
L454182	u7180	m482	SAM	You've led a charmed life.
L454181	u7173	m482	LILA	I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
L454180	u7180	m482	SAM	I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
L454179	u7173	m482	LILA	She haven't even called you?
L454178	u7180	m482	SAM	How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
L454177	u7173	m482	LILA	Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
L454176	u7180	m482	SAM	No.
L454175	u7173	m482	LILA	I ought to call the police right now!
L454174	u7180	m482	SAM	He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
L454173	u7173	m482	LILA	No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
L454172	u7180	m482	SAM	It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
L454171	u7173	m482	LILA	I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
L454169	u7180	m482	SAM	You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
L454168	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
L454142	u7180	m482	SAM	Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
L454141	u7173	m482	LILA	Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
L454140	u7180	m482	SAM	Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
L454139	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454138	u7180	m482	SAM	Is Mary... in trouble?
L454137	u7173	m482	LILA	I hate tears. 
L454136	u7180	m482	SAM	What thing could we be in together?
L454135	u7173	m482	LILA	Huh?
L454134	u7180	m482	SAM	What thing?
L454130	u7173	m482	LILA	Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
L454129	u7180	m482	SAM	Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
L454128	u7173	m482	LILA	What do you know about it?
L454127	u7180	m482	SAM	I was getting to that!
L454126	u7173	m482	LILA	Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
L454125	u7180	m482	SAM	Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
L454124	u7173	m482	LILA	A good reason, I suppose.
L454123	u7180	m482	SAM	And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
L454122	u7173	m482	LILA	Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
L454121	u7180	m482	SAM	No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
L454120	u7173	m482	LILA	To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
L454119	u7180	m482	SAM	What should I know?
L454117	u7173	m482	LILA	Don't you know?
L454116	u7180	m482	SAM	What's the matter?
L454115	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
L454114	u7180	m482	SAM	Where?
L454113	u7173	m482	LILA	With you.
L454112	u7180	m482	SAM	Here?
L454111	u7173	m482	LILA	I want to know if my sister is here.
L454110	u7180	m482	SAM	Is something wrong?
L454109	u7173	m482	LILA	Is Mary here?
L454108	u7180	m482	SAM	Lila.
L454107	u7173	m482	LILA	I'm Mary's sister.
L454106	u7180	m482	SAM	Sure...
L454105	u7173	m482	LILA	May I talk to you?
L454104	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes?
L453891	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
L453890	u7180	m482	SAM	Hey, we can leave together can't we?
L453889	u7175	m482	MARY	Don't miss your plane.
L453888	u7180	m482	SAM	How can you even think a thing like that!
L453887	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm thinking of it.
L453886	u7180	m482	SAM	You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
L453885	u7175	m482	MARY	I'll lick the stamps.
L453884	u7180	m482	SAM	And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
L453883	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam, let's go get married.
L453882	u7180	m482	SAM	Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
L453881	u7175	m482	MARY	I haven't even been married once yet!
L453880	u7180	m482	SAM	A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
L453879	u7175	m482	MARY	I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
L453878	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
L453877	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
L453876	u7175	m482	MARY	You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
L453875	u7180	m482	SAM	Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
L453874	u7180	m482	SAM	All right.
L453873	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam! No!
L453872	u7180	m482	SAM	And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
L453871	u7175	m482	MARY	We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
L453870	u7180	m482	SAM	Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
L453869	u7175	m482	MARY	No.
L453868	u7180	m482	SAM	I can come down next week.
L453867	u7175	m482	MARY	I have to go, Sam.
L453866	u7180	m482	SAM	I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
L453865	u7175	m482	MARY	You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
L453864	u7180	m482	SAM	And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
L453863	u7180	m482	SAM	Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
L453862	u7175	m482	MARY	Can you?
L453861	u7180	m482	SAM	You can't laugh at it, huh?
L453860	u7175	m482	MARY	It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
L453859	u7180	m482	SAM	And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
L453858	u7175	m482	MARY	I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
L453857	u7180	m482	SAM	Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
L453856	u7175	m482	MARY	This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
L453855	u7180	m482	SAM	For what?
L453854	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam. This is the last time.
L453853	u7180	m482	SAM	The only girlish thing you have lost.
L453852	u7175	m482	MARY	I've lost my girlish laughter.
L453851	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
L453850	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam!
L453849	u7180	m482	SAM	You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
L453848	u7175	m482	MARY	When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
L453847	u7180	m482	SAM	I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
L453846	u7175	m482	MARY	Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
L453845	u7180	m482	SAM	We could laze around here a while longer.
L453844	u7175	m482	MARY	What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
L453843	u7180	m482	SAM	Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
L454097	u7175	m482	MARY	Good night.
L454096	u7177	m482	NORMAN	That's it. 
L454095	u7175	m482	MARY	Crane.
L454094	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Alright, Miss... 
L454093	u7175	m482	MARY	Very early. Dawn.
L454092	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
L454091	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd like to, but...
L454090	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
L454089	u7175	m482	MARY	I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
L454088	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Phoenix?
L454087	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
L454086	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You're not going to... to your room already?
L454085	u7175	m482	MARY	Norman.
L454084	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Thank you, Norman.
L454083	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
L454082	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
L454081	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
L454080	u7175	m482	MARY	I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
L454079	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
L454078	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
L454077	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse ""someplace.""  Put her in Someplace!"
L454076	u7175	m482	MARY	Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
L454075	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
L454074	u7175	m482	MARY	No, not like me.
L454073	u7177	m482	NORMAN	To a private island, like you?
L454072	u7175	m482	MARY	Why don't you go away?
L454071	u7177	m482	NORMAN	A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
L454070	u7175	m482	MARY	Except you.
L454069	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
L454068	u7175	m482	MARY	She sounded strong...
L454067	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
L454066	u7175	m482	MARY	If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
L454065	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
L454064	u7175	m482	MARY	You should... mind it.
L454063	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
L454062	u7175	m482	MARY	Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
L454061	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
L454060	u7175	m482	MARY	Why do you ask that?
L454059	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What are you running away from?
L454058	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm looking for a private island.
L454057	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
L454056	u7175	m482	MARY	Only my share.
L454055	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
L454054	u7175	m482	MARY	You go out... with friends?
L454053	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
L454052	u7175	m482	MARY	Is your time so empty?
L454051	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
L454050	u7175	m482	MARY	A man should have a hobby.
L454049	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
L454048	u7175	m482	MARY	I imagine so.
L454047	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Uncommon, too.
L454046	u7175	m482	MARY	It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
L454045	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats ""like a bird,"" is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them..."
L454044	u7175	m482	MARY	You'd know, of course.
L454043	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You eat like a bird.
L454042	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
L454041	u7175	m482	MARY	You're very... kind.
L454037	u7175	m482	MARY	Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
L454036	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
L454035	u7175	m482	MARY	You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
L454034	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"Mother...  ...what is the phrase... ""she isn't herself today""... I think that's it."
L454033	u7175	m482	MARY	I've caused you some trouble.
L454024	u7177	m482	NORMAN	All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
L454023	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd like to.
L454022	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
L454021	u7175	m482	MARY	No.
L454020	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
L454019	u7175	m482	MARY	Thank you. Again.
L454018	u7177	m482	NORMAN	There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
L454017	u7175	m482	MARY	I have?
L454016	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You have something most girls never have.
L454015	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Norman Bates.
L454014	u7175	m482	MARY	Thank you, Mr. Bates.
L454013	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
L454012	u7175	m482	MARY	The bathroom.
L454011	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with ""Bates' Motel"" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... "
L454010	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
L454009	u7175	m482	MARY	Am I that close to Fairvale?
L454008	u7177	m482	NORMAN	There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
L454007	u7175	m482	MARY	I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
L454005	u7175	m482	MARY	Los Angeles.
L454004	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
L454002	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
L454001	u7175	m482	MARY	I thought I'd gotten off the main...
L454000	u7177	m482	NORMAN	We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
L453999	u7175	m482	MARY	You have a vacancy?
L453998	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Dirty night.
L453948	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Please.
L453947	u7175	m482	MARY	Why?
L453946	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	May I see your license?
L453945	u7175	m482	MARY	Now what?
L453944	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Wait a minute!
L453943	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	No need to apologize...
L453942	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm sorry.
L453941	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	"In the course of my duty, I never ""take up"" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest..."
L453940	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
L453939	u7175	m482	MARY	Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
L453938	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Is there?
L453937	u7175	m482	MARY	Please... I'd like to go...
L453936	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Frankly, yes.
L453935	u7175	m482	MARY	Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
L453934	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Is anything wrong?
L453933	u7175	m482	MARY	Then I'm free to go...?
L453932	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	No, m'am.
L453931	u7175	m482	MARY	I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
L453930	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
L453929	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
L453928	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	You slept here all night?
L453927	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
L453926	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	In quite a hurry.
L454402	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	He's already been.
L454401	u7180	m482	SAM	We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
L454389	u7180	m482	SAM	I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
L454388	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Maybe you saw Mary!
L454387	u7180	m482	SAM	You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
L454336	u7180	m482	SAM	No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
L454335	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Norman took a wife?
L454334	u7180	m482	SAM	He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
L454333	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
L454332	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
L454331	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Mary is Lila's sister?
L454326	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
L454325	u7180	m482	SAM	We have a problem.
L454322	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
L454321	u7180	m482	SAM	Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
L454320	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Oh?
L454404	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Have you two had breakfast?
L454403	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Went out before service.
L454386	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
L454385	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
L454384	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
L454381	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
L454380	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Barefaced.
L454371	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
L454370	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Arbogast.
L454369	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
L454365	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
L454364	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Recluse. Kinder word.
L454361	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	At this hour?
L454360	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
L454513	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Leave me alone!
L454512	u7180	m482	SAM	...Forty thousand dollars!
L454511	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Leave me alone!
L454510	u7180	m482	SAM	Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
L454509	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Shut up!
L454508	u7180	m482	SAM	Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
L454507	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Do what?
L454506	u7180	m482	SAM	I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
L454505	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't know what you've been saying.
L454504	u7180	m482	SAM	You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
L454503	u7180	m482	SAM	I didn't think so.
L454502	u7177	m482	NORMAN	My mother is not dead!
L454501	u7180	m482	SAM	And now that your mother's dead?
L454500	u7177	m482	NORMAN	This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
L454499	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
L454497	u7180	m482	SAM	Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
L454496	u7177	m482	NORMAN	That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
L454495	u7180	m482	SAM	I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
L454494	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Yes.
L454493	u7180	m482	SAM	I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
L454492	u7180	m482	SAM	Fine.
L454491	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Satisfied with your cabin?
L454490	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
L454489	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Looking for me?
L454452	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll show you the cabin.
L454451	u7180	m482	SAM	Haven't any.
L454450	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll get your bags.
L454449	u7180	m482	SAM	Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
L454448	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It isn't necessary.
L454447	u7180	m482	SAM	Better sign in first, hasn't we?
L454446	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll take you to...
L454445	u7180	m482	SAM	We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
L454444	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I suppose you want a cabin.
L454443	u7180	m482	SAM	Just coming up to ring for you.
L454032	u7178	m482	NORMAN'S VOICE	Shut up! Shut up!
L454031	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
L454030	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
L454029	u7178	m482	NORMAN'S VOICE	Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
L454028	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
L454027	u7178	m482	NORMAN'S VOICE	Mother, please...
L454026	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
L454410	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
L454409	u7180	m482	SAM	No mother.
L454406	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
L454405	u7180	m482	SAM	You didn't find anything.
L454392	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
L454391	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
L454390	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
L454375	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
L454374	u7180	m482	SAM	Was that all?
L454363	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
L454362	u7180	m482	SAM	He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
L454352	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
L454351	u7180	m482	SAM	Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
L454346	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	From what?
L454345	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes.
L454342	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Left Phoenix under her own steam?
L454341	u7180	m482	SAM	They thought she'd be coming to me.
L456022	u7184	m483	2ND EMBALMER	What--special autopsy?
L456021	u7183	m483	1ST EMBALMER	That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
L456020	u7184	m483	2ND EMBALMER	Did I?
L456019	u7183	m483	1ST EMBALMER	You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
L456018	u7184	m483	2ND EMBALMER	Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
L456017	u7183	m483	1ST EMBALMER	By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
L456118	u7190	m483	JONES	[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
L456117	u7185	m483	2ND OFFICER	Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
L456116	u7190	m483	JONES	Did she talk?
L456115	u7185	m483	2ND OFFICER	Just before she died she came to--
L456114	u7190	m483	JONES	Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
L456113	u7185	m483	2ND OFFICER	Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
L456267	u7186	m483	ALICE	How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
L456266	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
L456265	u7186	m483	ALICE	What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
L456264	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
L456263	u7186	m483	ALICE	Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
L456262	u7186	m483	ALICE	I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
L456261	u7186	m483	ALICE	No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
L456260	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
L456259	u7186	m483	ALICE	Then you knew of the inheritance?
L456258	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
L456257	u7186	m483	ALICE	So--friendly or otherwise--?
L456256	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
L456255	u7186	m483	ALICE	Gosh, you had me fooled.
L456228	u7186	m483	ALICE	Okay--I'll be here at eight.
L456227	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
L456226	u7186	m483	ALICE	Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
L456225	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
L456224	u7186	m483	ALICE	He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
L456223	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
L456222	u7186	m483	ALICE	He's inherited a fortune.
L456221	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Indeed, he has often told me.
L456220	u7186	m483	ALICE	It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
L456219	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
L456218	u7186	m483	ALICE	You mean he doesn't work for you?
L456216	u7186	m483	ALICE	I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
L456215	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Did you wish to see someone?
L456125	u7190	m483	JONES	Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
L456124	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
L456123	u7190	m483	JONES	Dr. Meirschultz, too?
L456122	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
L456121	u7190	m483	JONES	Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
L456112	u7190	m483	JONES	Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
L456111	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
L456106	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	I don't know--I can't tell--
L456105	u7190	m483	JONES	Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
L456104	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	You--a friend to me?
L456103	u7190	m483	JONES	No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
L456102	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	Maybe you want my money, too.
L456101	u7190	m483	JONES	Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
L456100	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
L456099	u7190	m483	JONES	What made you steal? Are you hungry?
L456097	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	I don't know, [I tell you].
L456096	u7190	m483	JONES	Who are you? What is your name?
L456095	u7187	m483	BUCKLEY	No-
L456132	u7188	m483	COLLINS	Why didn't you notify the police?
L456131	u7193	m483	WOMAN	I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
L456130	u7188	m483	COLLINS	Maybe you're right.
L456129	u7193	m483	WOMAN	It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
L456128	u7188	m483	COLLINS	That sounds to me very remarkable.
L456127	u7193	m483	WOMAN	Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
L456149	u7190	m483	JONES	By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
L456148	u7189	m483	GOOF	Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
L456146	u7189	m483	GOOF	You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
L456145	u7190	m483	JONES	But where do the rats come in?
L456144	u7189	m483	GOOF	That's it. You get it quick.
L456143	u7190	m483	JONES	Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
L456142	u7189	m483	GOOF	Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
L456141	u7190	m483	JONES	What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
L456140	u7189	m483	GOOF	Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
L456139	u7190	m483	JONES	Thousands?
L456138	u7189	m483	GOOF	Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
L456137	u7190	m483	JONES	[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
L456136	u7189	m483	GOOF	He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
L456135	u7190	m483	JONES	I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
L456279	u7190	m483	JONES	Come on, we're wasting time.
L456278	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
L456277	u7190	m483	JONES	Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
L456276	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
L456275	u7190	m483	JONES	Take me down there.
L456274	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
L456273	u7190	m483	JONES	What's that?
L456272	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
L456271	u7190	m483	JONES	Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
L456270	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	You here again?
L456242	u7190	m483	JONES	I'd like to have a look.
L456241	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
L456240	u7190	m483	JONES	What's down there?
L456239	u7190	m483	JONES	Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
L456238	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
L456237	u7190	m483	JONES	Do you have many patients, doctor?
L456236	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
L456235	u7190	m483	JONES	Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
L456234	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
L456233	u7190	m483	JONES	So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
L456232	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
L456231	u7190	m483	JONES	Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
L456230	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Well, news of Buckley?
L456229	u7190	m483	JONES	How do you do.
L456157	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
L456156	u7190	m483	JONES	By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
L456153	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	You found Buckley?
L456152	u7190	m483	JONES	I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
L456253	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
L456252	u7192	m483	MRS. BUCKLEY	It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
L456251	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
L456250	u7192	m483	MRS. BUCKLEY	How? What can I do?
L456249	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
L456213	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
L456212	u7192	m483	MRS. BUCKLEY	You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
L456080	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
L456079	u7192	m483	MRS. BUCKLEY	I'm going to call the police.
L456078	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	What are you going to do?
L456032	u7191	m483	MAXWELL	He isn't here.
L456031	u7192	m483	MRS. BUCKLEY	Dr. Meirschultz, please.
L457450	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
L457449	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	Yes!
L457448	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	You're losing your blood?
L457447	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	I'm losing my blood!
L457446	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	What is it now?
L457443	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	Go to sleep!
L457442	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	The wound is bleeding!
L457441	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	What is it?
L457396	u7198	m484	NURSE	The master ... is asleep!
L457395	u7195	m484	LONE	Yes!
L457394	u7198	m484	NURSE	Your father?
L457376	u7198	m484	NURSE	What did it say?
L457375	u7195	m484	LONE	That called ... commanded ...
L457374	u7198	m484	NURSE	That spoke to you?
L457373	u7195	m484	LONE	A voice ...
L457372	u7198	m484	NURSE	What were you dreaming about?
L457332	u7196	m484	MARC	No!  Good night!
L457331	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	No?
L457330	u7196	m484	MARC	There's no child here, and no dogs either.
L457329	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	But ... the dogs...
L457328	u7196	m484	MARC	There's no child here.
L457327	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	Yes.
L457326	u7196	m484	MARC	The child!
L457325	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	Yes, the child ...
L457324	u7196	m484	MARC	Did you hear?
L457434	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Lone.
L457433	u7199	m484	THE DRAWING-ROOM	Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
L457432	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
L457431	u7199	m484	THE DRAWING-ROOM	Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
L457430	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
L457429	u7199	m484	THE DRAWING-ROOM	Joseph returns from the room where Gis?le is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
L457428	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
L458287	u7212	m485	SPARROW	It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
L458286	u7201	m485	CAPTAIN	You lie!
L458285	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
L458284	u7201	m485	CAPTAIN	But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
L458283	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
L458282	u7201	m485	CAPTAIN	You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
L458010	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
L458009	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I think so.
L457999	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
L457998	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
L457997	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
L457996	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
L457995	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
L457994	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
L457993	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
L457992	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Why didn't you eat last night?
L457991	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
L457990	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	There's no hurry. It's early.
L457924	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'll have it for supper.  So long.
L457923	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But what about lunch?
L457876	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
L457875	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
L457874	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
L457873	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	You would.
L457872	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
L457871	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I don't agree with you.
L457870	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
L457869	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
L457868	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
L457844	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
L457843	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Did you? Where?
L457842	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
L457841	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
L457840	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
L457839	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	What are you laughing at?
L457838	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
L457837	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
L457836	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Yes, why?
L458071	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
L458070	u7210	m485	RALPH	That's the way I feel about it.
L458069	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	So that's the way it is?
L458068	u7210	m485	RALPH	Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
L458067	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'd call it stupid at any time.
L458066	u7210	m485	RALPH	You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
L458061	u7210	m485	RALPH	I'm not quarreling, only ...
L458060	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
L458059	u7210	m485	RALPH	Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
L458058	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
L458057	u7210	m485	RALPH	Well, I do say it.
L458056	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I won't let you say that!
L458055	u7210	m485	RALPH	What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
L458054	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
L458053	u7210	m485	RALPH	She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
L458052	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But why? She's the best friend I've got.
L457911	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Delighted, I'm sure. 
L457910	u7210	m485	RALPH	Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
L457892	u7210	m485	RALPH	Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
L457891	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
L458291	u7208	m485	IGOR	And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
L458290	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
L458258	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Ralph! Ralph!
L458257	u7208	m485	IGOR	We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
L458256	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Let me go! Let me go!
L458250	u7208	m485	IGOR	It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
L458249	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
L458248	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'd love to.
L458247	u7208	m485	IGOR	And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
L458246	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But it was really my fault.
L458245	u7208	m485	IGOR	Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
L458244	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
L458243	u7208	m485	IGOR	Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
L458242	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
L458022	u7208	m485	IGOR	They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
L458021	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But I think these things are beautiful.
L457918	u7208	m485	IGOR	At any time. You will always be welcome.
L457917	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	We'll be coming to the opening.
L457915	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'd love to, at any time.
L457914	u7208	m485	IGOR	Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
L457913	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
L457912	u7208	m485	IGOR	If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
L458162	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
L458161	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
L458133	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
L458132	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	You mean he was colored?
L458131	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
L458122	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
L458121	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	It happens that I'm the law.
L458120	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
L458119	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	What do you think I am?
L458118	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
L458113	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
L458112	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	Are you giving me this straight?
L458111	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
L458110	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
L458109	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	The body of Joan Gale!
L458108	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	What! What are you talking about?
L458337	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
L458336	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That's what I said.
L458332	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
L458331	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
L458218	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
L458217	u7204	m485	EDITOR	What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
L458216	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
L458215	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
L458214	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
L458213	u7204	m485	EDITOR	What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
L458212	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
L458211	u7204	m485	EDITOR	You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
L458210	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
L457971	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
L457970	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Almost certain.
L457969	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No kiddin'?
L457968	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
L457967	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What do you mean?
L457966	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
L457965	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
L457964	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
L457963	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Let it go.
L457962	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
L457961	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
L457960	u7204	m485	EDITOR	I used to be married to one.
L457959	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
L457958	u7204	m485	EDITOR	About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
L457957	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What!
L457956	u7204	m485	EDITOR	We'll grant that.
L457955	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
L457954	u7204	m485	EDITOR	No kiddin'. What's your idea?
L457953	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
L457952	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
L457951	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I asked you to keep your trap shut!
L457950	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Now don't that call for an extra!
L457949	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
L457948	u7204	m485	EDITOR	All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
L457947	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
L457946	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
L457945	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I am right! I know I'm right!
L457942	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
L457941	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
L457938	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
L457937	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
L457936	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
L457790	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Get out of here.
L457789	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Which one is me? The horse?
L457786	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
L457785	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No, there's another point I want to iron out.
L457784	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
L457783	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
L457781	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Nope, I'm through!
L457780	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
L457779	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
L457778	u7204	m485	EDITOR	You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
L457777	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
L457776	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
L457775	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
L457774	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
L457773	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	And they never proved anything against him.
L457772	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
L457771	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
L457770	u7204	m485	EDITOR	You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
L457769	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
L457768	u7204	m485	EDITOR	I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
L457767	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	You give me a pain!
L457766	u7204	m485	EDITOR	He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
L457765	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
L457764	u7204	m485	EDITOR	And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
L457763	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
L457762	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
L457761	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
L457760	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
L457635	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
L457634	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
L457633	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
L457631	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
L457630	u7204	m485	EDITOR	All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
L457629	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
L457628	u7204	m485	EDITOR	I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
L457625	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
L457624	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Meaning what?
L457623	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
L457622	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Charming. More delightful people crippled.
L457621	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
L457620	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
L457619	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
L457618	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
L458231	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
L458230	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
L458229	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
L458228	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
L458225	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No, sir. About three months ago.
L458224	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	Don't remember what day that was, do you?
L458223	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I don't remember. Not so very far--
L458222	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	Where were you going when you got in that cab?
L458221	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
L457676	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Thanks.
L457675	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	It's all yours.
L457674	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
L457673	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
L457672	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Make it snappy, Colonel.
L457668	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Hotcha! Saved, one job!
L457667	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
L457666	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What does that prove?
L457665	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
L457664	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
L457663	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
L457662	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
L457661	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	That's the one.
L457660	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Old Howard Winton's cub?
L457659	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Do you know George Winton?
L457658	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No foolin' -- any suspect?
L457657	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
L457656	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
L457655	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
L457654	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
L457653	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	No kiddin'.
L457652	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
L457651	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
L457650	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	How's every little thing?
L457649	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Call the Homicide Squad!
L457640	u7209	m485	MAN	Here's a wow.
L457639	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
L457638	u7209	m485	MAN	I told you he was a sore.
L457616	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
L457615	u7209	m485	MAN	Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
L457614	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
L457613	u7209	m485	MAN	What do you mean police dog?
L457612	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
L457611	u7209	m485	MAN	Where'd you get the stag hound?
L458278	u7210	m485	RALPH	Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
L458277	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
L458268	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
L458267	u7210	m485	RALPH	Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
L458266	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
L458265	u7210	m485	RALPH	I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
L458264	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
L458263	u7210	m485	RALPH	What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
L457901	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Horsefeathers!
L457900	u7210	m485	RALPH	Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
L457899	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
L457898	u7210	m485	RALPH	No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
L457897	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	He might get some publicity out of it.
L457890	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
L457889	u7210	m485	RALPH	Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
L457888	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Fine, thanks.
L458309	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
L458308	u7213	m485	WINTON	What is it? What happened?
L458206	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
L458205	u7213	m485	WINTON	Heaven knows. A lot.
L458204	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	How much money have you got?
L458203	u7213	m485	WINTON	You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
L458202	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Oh, is that what caused it?
L458201	u7213	m485	WINTON	No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
L458200	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
L458199	u7213	m485	WINTON	I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
L458198	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
L458194	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Darned if I don't! 
L458193	u7213	m485	WINTON	You go in for dangerous things.
L458192	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Why?
L458144	u7213	m485	WINTON	No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
L458143	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
L458082	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
L458081	u7213	m485	WINTON	Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
L458080	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
L458079	u7213	m485	WINTON	I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
L458078	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
L458077	u7213	m485	WINTON	Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
L458076	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
L458075	u7213	m485	WINTON	Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
L457755	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	That's what they're going to ask you.
L457754	u7213	m485	WINTON	Who'd steal her body?
L457753	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	That happens to be the truth.
L457752	u7213	m485	WINTON	Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
L457751	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
L457750	u7213	m485	WINTON	Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
L457749	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
L457748	u7213	m485	WINTON	No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
L457747	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	You weren't going with her?
L457746	u7213	m485	WINTON	We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
L457745	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I see. Was that all she said?
L457744	u7213	m485	WINTON	She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
L457743	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
L457742	u7213	m485	WINTON	They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
L457741	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
L457740	u7213	m485	WINTON	For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
L457739	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
L457738	u7213	m485	WINTON	My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
L457737	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	That's what I said.
L457736	u7213	m485	WINTON	Cry-baby?
L457735	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
L457734	u7213	m485	WINTON	Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! 
L457733	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
L457732	u7213	m485	WINTON	Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
L457545	u7208	m485	IGOR	Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
L457544	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	Good night, sir.
L457543	u7208	m485	IGOR	It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
L457542	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
L457541	u7208	m485	IGOR	You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
L457540	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
L457539	u7208	m485	IGOR	My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
L457538	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
L457537	u7208	m485	IGOR	You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
L457574	u7214	m485	WORTH	Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done. 
L457573	u7208	m485	IGOR	You're insane.
L457572	u7214	m485	WORTH	Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
L457571	u7208	m485	IGOR	And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
L457570	u7214	m485	WORTH	You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
L457569	u7208	m485	IGOR	And you think I will permit this, my friend?
L457568	u7214	m485	WORTH	I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
L457565	u7208	m485	IGOR	You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
L457564	u7214	m485	WORTH	I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
L457563	u7208	m485	IGOR	A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
L457562	u7214	m485	WORTH	Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
L457561	u7208	m485	IGOR	Fire insurance!
L457560	u7214	m485	WORTH	No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
L457559	u7208	m485	IGOR	Is that a fact?
L457558	u7214	m485	WORTH	Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
L457557	u7208	m485	IGOR	Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
L457554	u7208	m485	IGOR	That is unfortunate.
L457553	u7214	m485	WORTH	I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
L458020	u7208	m485	IGOR	Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
L458019	u7210	m485	RALPH	I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
L457885	u7210	m485	RALPH	All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
L457884	u7208	m485	IGOR	If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
L457883	u7210	m485	RALPH	I will only be gone about half an hour.
L457882	u7208	m485	IGOR	That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
L457881	u7210	m485	RALPH	But I have some friends waiting.
L457880	u7208	m485	IGOR	To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
L457879	u7210	m485	RALPH	To lunch.
L457808	u7208	m485	IGOR	If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
L457807	u7210	m485	RALPH	But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
L457806	u7208	m485	IGOR	Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
L457805	u7210	m485	RALPH	That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
L457804	u7208	m485	IGOR	And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
L457803	u7210	m485	RALPH	One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
L457802	u7208	m485	IGOR	If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
L458018	u7208	m485	IGOR	Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
L458017	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I'd know him anywhere.
L457933	u7208	m485	IGOR	He can't hear you.
L457932	u7212	m485	SPARROW	What are you laughing at?
L457931	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
L457930	u7208	m485	IGOR	She is the soul of that statue.
L457828	u7208	m485	IGOR	You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
L457827	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
L457822	u7208	m485	IGOR	Yes.
L457821	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Shall we unpack it?
L457817	u7208	m485	IGOR	Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
L457816	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
L457815	u7208	m485	IGOR	Have you got it? Is it completed?
L457980	u7213	m485	WINTON	Thanks.
L457979	u7214	m485	WORTH	Well, any time I can do anything for you --
L457978	u7213	m485	WINTON	They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
L457977	u7214	m485	WORTH	I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
L457976	u7213	m485	WINTON	Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
L457975	u7214	m485	WORTH	Yep. Everything settled.
L488214	u7469	m505	DEWEY	That doesn't work, sir.
L488213	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
L488197	u7469	m505	DEWEY	What now?
L488196	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
L488195	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Can't we hold him?
L488024	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
L488023	u7469	m505	DEWEY	How's the name search going?
L488021	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
L488020	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I can do it, Captain.
L487919	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We're aware of that.
L487918	u7469	m505	DEWEY	The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
L487917	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We know that, son.
L488170	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	On national television.
L488169	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	I would say we are now officially baffled.
L488168	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
L488167	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	You're sure about this two person thing?
L488166	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	They've broken their pattern.
L488165	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	He's broken his pattern.
L487936	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
L487935	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
L487914	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
L487913	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
L487887	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Take the neighborhood.
L487886	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
L487885	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Have you checked the...
L487830	u7464	m505	CICI	Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
L487829	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
L487828	u7464	m505	CICI	I'm losing you.
L487827	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Hang up...call...
L487826	u7464	m505	CICI	What? I can't hear you...
L487825	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Don't do that. Hang up...call...
L487823	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	That's smart.
L487822	u7464	m505	CICI	Outside.
L487817	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	I can't believe you're alone in that house.
L487816	u7464	m505	CICI	Stop it...
L487815	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
L487813	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Where?
L487812	u7464	m505	CICI	I heard a noise.
L487811	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	What is it?
L487810	u7464	m505	CICI	Shit.
L487809	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
L487808	u7464	m505	CICI	No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
L487787	u7464	m505	CICI	Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
L487786	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Don't. Think Bailey.
L487785	u7464	m505	CICI	I won't.
L487784	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
L487777	u7464	m505	CICI	No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
L487776	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	thought he was doing AA.
L487775	u7464	m505	CICI	No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
L487862	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Don't forget to set the alarm.
L487861	u7464	m505	CICI	WHAAAATT?
L487860	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	No, it's me.
L487859	u7464	m505	CICI	Hello? Ted?
L487803	u7464	m505	CICI	I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
L487802	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	I'm inquisitive.
L487801	u7464	m505	CICI	Why do you always answer a question with a question?
L487800	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Why would you wanna do that?
L487799	u7464	m505	CICI	What if I said goodbye?
L487798	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	What if I said you?
L487797	u7464	m505	CICI	Drink with your brain. That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
L487796	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	That's too bad.
L487795	u7464	m505	CICI	I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
L487794	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Why aren't you there?
L487793	u7464	m505	CICI	We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
L487792	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Where is everybody?
L487791	u7464	m505	CICI	Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
L487790	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	That's okay.
L487789	u7464	m505	CICI	Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
L487783	u7464	m505	CICI	Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
L487782	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Someone who wants to talk to you.
L487781	u7464	m505	CICI	Cici. Who's this?
L487780	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Who is this?
L487779	u7464	m505	CICI	Yes.
L487854	u7464	m505	CICI	I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
L487853	u7466	m505	DAWNIE	Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
L487847	u7464	m505	CICI	Just some asshole trying to scare me.
L487846	u7466	m505	DAWNIE	I had to change. Did anyone call?
L487845	u7464	m505	CICI	I thought you were going to the mixer?
L487844	u7466	m505	DAWNIE	I live here.
L487843	u7464	m505	CICI	Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
L488489	u7465	m505	COTTON	Not until you?re dead.
L488488	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It?s over, Cotton.
L488487	u7465	m505	COTTON	I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
L488486	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Please, Cotton, don?t do this.
L488485	u7465	m505	COTTON	It?s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I?m the victim.
L488108	u7465	m505	COTTON	You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
L488107	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What?
L488106	u7465	m505	COTTON	It helped me realize one thing.
L488105	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Did it?
L488104	u7465	m505	COTTON	I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
L488103	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
L488102	u7465	m505	COTTON	I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
L488101	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
L488100	u7465	m505	COTTON	You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
L488099	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I did that.
L488098	u7465	m505	COTTON	You could start with an apology.
L488097	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What do you want from me, Cotton?
L488096	u7465	m505	COTTON	Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
L488095	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I don't think that's a good idea.
L488094	u7465	m505	COTTON	Can we talk?
L488093	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Cotton.
L488208	u7465	m505	COTTON	Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
L488207	u7470	m505	GALE	Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
L488206	u7465	m505	COTTON	You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
L488205	u7470	m505	GALE	Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
L488204	u7465	m505	COTTON	No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
L488203	u7470	m505	GALE	You have a right to be angry.
L488202	u7465	m505	COTTON	Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
L488201	u7470	m505	GALE	Did you do it?
L488200	u7465	m505	COTTON	You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
L488476	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Enter Cotton Weary.
L488475	u7470	m505	GALE	But you?ll never get away with it.
L488474	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Finish what my son started.
L488473	u7470	m505	GALE	What are you going to do?
L488466	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
L488465	u7470	m505	GALE	Jesus, you?re just as whacked as your son.
L488460	u7470	m505	GALE	You?re all in this together?
L488459	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	I couldn?t believe you didn?t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
L487977	u7470	m505	GALE	Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
L487976	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
L487975	u7470	m505	GALE	No, I don't.
L487974	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
L487973	u7470	m505	GALE	Why don't you ask them?
L487972	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	And are the police sure about that?
L487971	u7470	m505	GALE	Home--where he lives.
L487970	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Where is Sidney's father?
L487969	u7470	m505	GALE	Tons and tons.
L487968	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Hi, Gale, any leads?
L487703	u7470	m505	GALE	Good for you.
L487702	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
L487701	u7470	m505	GALE	Do I know you? You look familiar.
L487700	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	And much richer as a result.
L487699	u7470	m505	GALE	Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
L487698	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
L487697	u7470	m505	GALE	Fair enough.
L487696	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
L487695	u7470	m505	GALE	Look, I'm sorry about the face.
L488230	u7478	m505	MICKEY	You freakin?
L488229	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah.
L488228	u7478	m505	MICKEY	No way.
L488227	u7468	m505	DEREK	She dumped me.
L488226	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Where's Sid?
L488225	u7468	m505	DEREK	Not one bit.
L488224	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
L488075	u7468	m505	DEREK	Definitely Whitney.
L488074	u7478	m505	MICKEY	And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY.
L488073	u7468	m505	DEREK	I think he's doing Dolly.
L488061	u7468	m505	DEREK	Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
L488060	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I could use some therapy.
L488039	u7468	m505	DEREK	I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
L488038	u7478	m505	MICKEY	What's your subject?
L488037	u7468	m505	DEREK	My documentary is due on Tuesday.
L487732	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
L487731	u7468	m505	DEREK	How do you put up with this Greek shit?
L488447	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	But nobody wants to see that. It?ll never go. They?ll rewrite you. You don?t want that.
L488446	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah, we?re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I?m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It?s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
L488413	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You?re not going to get away with this.
L488412	u7468	m505	DEREK	Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
L488393	u7468	m505	DEREK	Good question. You took the bait.
L488392	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Why?
L488381	u7468	m505	DEREK	That?s quick.
L488380	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No. This is a set up.
L488379	u7468	m505	DEREK	Go on, untie him.
L488124	u7468	m505	DEREK	Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
L488123	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
L488122	u7468	m505	DEREK	I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
L488121	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No, it's not.
L488120	u7468	m505	DEREK	I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
L487966	u7468	m505	DEREK	It's under control.
L487965	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
L487964	u7468	m505	DEREK	Let us decide that.
L487963	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
L487960	u7468	m505	DEREK	I think it's out of your control.
L487959	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	This is exactly what I don't want.
L487892	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'll get my jacket.
L487891	u7468	m505	DEREK	Lemme take you home.
L487877	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	The forbidden subject.
L487876	u7468	m505	DEREK	About what?
L487871	u7468	m505	DEREK	I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
L487870	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
L487729	u7468	m505	DEREK	Sid, you don't have to.
L487728	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
L487688	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
L487687	u7468	m505	DEREK	I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
L487686	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	"I skipped. Too many ""That's her"" looks."
L487685	u7468	m505	DEREK	How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
L488462	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Tuition?s expensive.
L488461	u7468	m505	DEREK	We had to have financing.
L488430	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Tails.
L488429	u7468	m505	DEREK	Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It?s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
L488428	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
L488427	u7468	m505	DEREK	Just for you, Sid.
L488426	u7472	m505	HALLIE	We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
L488425	u7468	m505	DEREK	Or it found us.
L488424	u7472	m505	HALLIE	So we found a compromise.
L488423	u7468	m505	DEREK	And we didn?t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money?s worth.
L488422	u7472	m505	HALLIE	..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
L488421	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing?s been done.
L488420	u7472	m505	HALLIE	A twist ending if you will.
L488419	u7468	m505	DEREK	Hope you?re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
L488418	u7472	m505	HALLIE	And now, drum roll please...
L488417	u7468	m505	DEREK	We?re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
L488416	u7472	m505	HALLIE	A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
L488415	u7468	m505	DEREK	The way I see it. We?ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
L488414	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Of course not. Who wants to? What?s the point if we don?t get caught? Where?s the glamour in that?
L488409	u7468	m505	DEREK	Until now.
L488408	u7472	m505	HALLIE	You?re the one who got away.
L488407	u7468	m505	DEREK	You?d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It?s a whole world, Sid. You?re really popular amongst the demented.
L488406	u7472	m505	HALLIE	We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
L488405	u7468	m505	DEREK	I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
L488404	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He sent me the cutest e-mail.
L488397	u7468	m505	DEREK	I find his work overwrought.
L488396	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He hates Oliver Stone.
L488395	u7468	m505	DEREK	I really don?t like that comparison, honey.
L488394	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
L488391	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
L488390	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
L488388	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I got it..
L488387	u7468	m505	DEREK	Need some help, honey.
L488063	u7468	m505	DEREK	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
L488062	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He seemed harmless.
L488051	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Randy somebody.
L488050	u7468	m505	DEREK	What guy?
L488049	u7472	m505	HALLIE	She's got guards with her.
L488046	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
L488045	u7468	m505	DEREK	You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
L488044	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Damned if I know. She ditched me.
L488043	u7468	m505	DEREK	Where's Sid?
L487953	u7468	m505	DEREK	And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
L487952	u7472	m505	HALLIE	So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
L487951	u7468	m505	DEREK	Two.
L488327	u7469	m505	DEWEY	There's nothing. I'm coming down.
L488326	u7470	m505	GALE	Dewey?
L488323	u7469	m505	DEWEY	No, wait here.
L488322	u7470	m505	GALE	Let's go.
L488318	u7469	m505	DEWEY	He filmed his victims.
L488317	u7470	m505	GALE	Jesus Christ!
L488314	u7469	m505	DEWEY	C'mon. Let's go.
L488313	u7470	m505	GALE	Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
L488311	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Over here.
L488310	u7470	m505	GALE	This is all too familiar.
L488309	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Let's find out.
L488308	u7470	m505	GALE	Ssshh! What was that?
L488292	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Hallie?
L488291	u7470	m505	GALE	Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
L488290	u7469	m505	DEWEY	The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
L488289	u7470	m505	GALE	And Joel's pre-med.
L488288	u7469	m505	DEWEY	They're roomates.
L488286	u7469	m505	DEWEY	We'd break some furniture.
L488285	u7470	m505	GALE	..and as lonely as I am...
L488284	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
L488283	u7470	m505	GALE	Dewey, you and I would never make it.
L488282	u7469	m505	DEWEY	And it's sexier in the dark.
L488281	u7469	m505	DEWEY	That's not the way it's done.
L488280	u7470	m505	GALE	Can we turn the light on?
L488279	u7469	m505	DEWEY	A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
L488278	u7470	m505	GALE	What are we looking for?
L488277	u7469	m505	DEWEY	You broke my heart.
L488271	u7470	m505	GALE	Billy had alibis too.
L488270	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
L488269	u7470	m505	GALE	He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
L488268	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Meaning?
L488267	u7470	m505	GALE	If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
L488194	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Not good.
L488193	u7470	m505	GALE	Not good. How you doin?
L488135	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
L488134	u7470	m505	GALE	Yeah?
L488133	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I know that.
L488132	u7470	m505	GALE	And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
L488131	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I think you're all an act.
L488130	u7469	m505	DEWEY	You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
L488129	u7470	m505	GALE	Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
L488128	u7469	m505	DEWEY	So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
L487751	u7469	m505	DEWEY	No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
L487750	u7470	m505	GALE	I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
L487749	u7469	m505	DEWEY	How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
L487748	u7470	m505	GALE	I never meant to imply...
L487747	u7469	m505	DEWEY	"Page 41. ""Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."""
L487746	u7470	m505	GALE	You have every right to be upset.
L487745	u7469	m505	DEWEY	No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
L487744	u7470	m505	GALE	Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
L487743	u7469	m505	DEWEY	"Page 32. ""Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence."" I think you've explained yourself."
L487742	u7470	m505	GALE	And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
L487741	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
L487740	u7470	m505	GALE	I see you read the book.
L487739	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
L487737	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
L487736	u7470	m505	GALE	I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
L487735	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Miss Weathers.
L487734	u7470	m505	GALE	Hello, Dwight.
L488273	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Whatever.
L488272	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
L488249	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Humor me, Sid.
L488248	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Dewey, there's no such place.
L488247	u7469	m505	DEWEY	The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
L487654	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
L487653	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Just in case...
L487652	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
L487651	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Don't worry...
L487650	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
L487647	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
L487646	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
L487645	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Yeah, right.
L487644	u7469	m505	DEWEY	As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
L487643	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
L487642	u7469	m505	DEWEY	They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
L487641	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Oh my God. How could it happen?
L487640	u7469	m505	DEWEY	They thought it was a publicity stunt.
L487639	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
L487998	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Watch your back.
L487997	u7470	m505	GALE	No, wait...
L487996	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
L487995	u7470	m505	GALE	You're getting obvious.
L487994	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
L487993	u7470	m505	GALE	What do you mean?
L487992	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	It's what you want from me.
L487991	u7470	m505	GALE	What do you want from me?
L487990	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Stay away from the cop.
L487989	u7470	m505	GALE	Oh--a God complex
L487988	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	I'm everywhere.
L487987	u7470	m505	GALE	Where are you?
L487986	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	You're pretty when you're angry.
L487985	u7470	m505	GALE	What do you want?
L487984	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	What if your life depended on it?
L487983	u7470	m505	GALE	I don't play games.
L487982	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	That's not the way we play the game.
L487981	u7470	m505	GALE	Who are you?
L487980	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	I'll give you one guess.
L487979	u7470	m505	GALE	Who is this?
L488454	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Oh my God.
L488453	u7470	m505	GALE	What?
L488253	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	But who would operate your camera?
L488252	u7470	m505	GALE	Sid, I'll come with you.
L487763	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	My morn was a Delta.
L487762	u7470	m505	GALE	It's good to see you involved.
L487761	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
L487760	u7470	m505	GALE	It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
L487759	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
L487758	u7470	m505	GALE	I'm sorry.
L487757	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
L487756	u7470	m505	GALE	Sidney. Hello. How are you?
L488369	u7470	m505	GALE	The safety what? Fuck that!
L488368	u7485	m505	VOICE	Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
L488367	u7470	m505	GALE	I don?t know.
L488366	u7485	m505	VOICE	Where is your attacker?
L488365	u7470	m505	GALE	Yes, goddammit!
L488364	u7485	m505	VOICE	Are you in danger now?
L488363	u7470	m505	GALE	Someone?s trying to kill me. I need the police.
L488079	u7478	m505	MICKEY	But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
L488078	u7472	m505	HALLIE	You're going to get it. You know what happens.
L488072	u7478	m505	MICKEY	And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you.
L488071	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Don't do this.
L488070	u7478	m505	MICKEY	"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
L488069	u7472	m505	HALLIE	What?
L488068	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I got a surprise for you.
L488056	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Is Sid in therapy?
L488055	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He tried to kill her first.
L487958	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Too bad.
L487957	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
L487956	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
L487715	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I have to watch rehearsal.
L487714	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I have rehearsal.
L487677	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
L487676	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
L488449	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
L488448	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Oh, Sid, you?re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
L488258	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's not a good idea, Hallie.
L488257	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I'm the only one who can cut him down.
L488251	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
L488250	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Can I come with her?
L488246	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'd really just like to be alone.
L488245	u7472	m505	HALLIE	It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
L488236	u7472	m505	HALLIE	No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
L488235	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
L488234	u7472	m505	HALLIE	We're missing the Sig Ep party.
L488012	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
L488011	u7472	m505	HALLIE	No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
L488010	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
L488009	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Who is that guy?
L488006	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Yeah, right.
L488005	u7472	m505	HALLIE	That was good.
L487950	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
L487949	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Gotta.
L487948	u7472	m505	HALLIE	What about rehearsal?
L487947	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Please, I have the perfect excuse.
L487946	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
L487623	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
L487622	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Time to change numbers again?
L487614	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Hello?  Hello?
L487613	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Knock yourself out.
L487604	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
L487603	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The young girl is slashed again.
L487602	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS Sit down."" Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised."
L487601	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
L487598	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
L487597	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
L487591	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
L487590	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
L487584	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	"The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. ""You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."" etc."
L487583	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
L488066	u7474	m505	JOEL	It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
L488065	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Easy black boy.
L488064	u7474	m505	JOEL	And white.
L488054	u7474	m505	JOEL	No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
L488053	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Her old boyfriend?
L488052	u7474	m505	JOEL	Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
L488048	u7474	m505	JOEL	Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
L488047	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I've been waiting for you, baby.
L487945	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I counted four.
L487944	u7474	m505	JOEL	How many guys they have on you?
L487962	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	But...
L487961	u7474	m505	JOEL	Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
L487955	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
L487954	u7474	m505	JOEL	Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
L487719	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Thanks, Joel.
L487718	u7474	m505	JOEL	I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
L487717	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You're not allowed to ask that.
L487716	u7474	m505	JOEL	I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
L487713	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
L487712	u7474	m505	JOEL	Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
L488222	u7475	m505	LOIS	I just love being a sister.

L487576	u7481	m505	PHIL	We can still Sandra Bullock it.
L487575	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
L487574	u7481	m505	PHIL	You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
L487573	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	I get scared really easy, okay.
L487572	u7481	m505	PHIL	Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?

L487549	u7481	m505	PHIL	Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
L487548	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?

L488352	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Where you going?
L488351	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'll be right back.
L488349	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	He's after me.
L488348	u7478	m505	MICKEY	What are you talking about?
L488347	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
L488346	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
L488119	u7482	m505	RANDY	Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
L488118	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Thanks for the movie, Randy.
L488117	u7482	m505	RANDY	I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
L488116	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
L488115	u7482	m505	RANDY	I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
L488114	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
L488113	u7482	m505	RANDY	If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
L488017	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Me, too. Randy. Me too.
L488016	u7482	m505	RANDY	Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
L488015	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Do you work for her now?
L488014	u7482	m505	RANDY	I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
L488013	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What do you want?
L488596	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
L488595	u7499	m506	TYSON	Melinda McGraw?
L488594	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
L488589	u7499	m506	TYSON	And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
L488588	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
L488587	u7499	m506	TYSON	Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
L488586	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
L488506	u7487	m506	BEN	Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
L488505	u7489	m506	CHRISTINE	I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
L488504	u7487	m506	BEN	Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
L488503	u7489	m506	CHRISTINE	All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
L488502	u7487	m506	BEN	Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
L488501	u7489	m506	CHRISTINE	No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
L488553	u7487	m506	BEN	Reaction to what?
L488552	u7500	m506	VOICE	To see your reaction.
L488551	u7487	m506	BEN	Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
L488550	u7500	m506	VOICE	Closer than you think.
L488549	u7487	m506	BEN	Where are you?
L488548	u7500	m506	VOICE	Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
L488547	u7487	m506	BEN	Yeah.
L488545	u7500	m506	VOICE	No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
L488544	u7487	m506	BEN	I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
L488543	u7500	m506	VOICE	You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
L488541	u7500	m506	VOICE	Good bye Ben.
L488540	u7487	m506	BEN	What?!
L488539	u7500	m506	VOICE	That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
L488538	u7487	m506	BEN	What?! But I did everything you said to do!
L488537	u7500	m506	VOICE	Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
L488536	u7487	m506	BEN	It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
L488534	u7500	m506	VOICE	Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
L488533	u7487	m506	BEN	I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
L488532	u7500	m506	VOICE	You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
L488531	u7487	m506	BEN	What kind of a game?
L488530	u7500	m506	VOICE	More of a game really.
L488529	u7487	m506	BEN	Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
L488528	u7500	m506	VOICE	I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
L488527	u7487	m506	BEN	What do you mean?
L488526	u7500	m506	VOICE	Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
L488525	u7487	m506	BEN	Thanks.
L488524	u7500	m506	VOICE	Really? You're such a talented actor.
L488523	u7487	m506	BEN	Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
L488522	u7500	m506	VOICE	You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
L488520	u7500	m506	VOICE	But your voice sounds so familiar.
L488519	u7487	m506	BEN	Asshole, Can't talk.
L488518	u7500	m506	VOICE	Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
L488517	u7487	m506	BEN	Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
L488516	u7500	m506	VOICE	Do I?
L488515	u7487	m506	BEN	I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
L488514	u7500	m506	VOICE	I don't know.
L488513	u7487	m506	BEN	Well what number are you trying to reach?
L488512	u7500	m506	VOICE	Who is this?
L488511	u7487	m506	BEN	Who is this?
L488510	u7500	m506	VOICE	Hello.
L488509	u7487	m506	BEN	Jesus.  Hello?
L488947	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
L488946	u7492	m506	GALE	What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
L488943	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
L488942	u7492	m506	GALE	It may be Maureen Reynolds --
L488941	u7488	m506	BIANCA	I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
L488936	u7492	m506	GALE	Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
L488935	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
L488934	u7492	m506	GALE	Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
L488933	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Nope.
L488932	u7492	m506	GALE	Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
L488931	u7488	m506	BIANCA	I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
L488930	u7492	m506	GALE	I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
L488929	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Can I help you?
L489067	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
L489066	u7492	m506	GALE	He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
L489065	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Jesus Gale what happened?
L488853	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
L488852	u7492	m506	GALE	Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
L488841	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
L488840	u7492	m506	GALE	OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
L488837	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
L488836	u7492	m506	GALE	Four? There are five.
L488833	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
L488832	u7492	m506	GALE	But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
L488831	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
L488715	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
L488714	u7492	m506	GALE	Please, call me Gale.
L488713	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
L488712	u7492	m506	GALE	But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
L488711	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
L488710	u7492	m506	GALE	Who?
L488709	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
L488708	u7492	m506	GALE	Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
L488707	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
L488635	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
L488634	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
L488633	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
L488632	u7492	m506	GALE	Alright Kincaid, no where to?
L488579	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	And who would that be?
L488578	u7492	m506	GALE	I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
L488577	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
L488576	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	There's more.
L488575	u7492	m506	GALE	That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
L488574	u7492	m506	GALE	A note?
L488573	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
L488572	u7492	m506	GALE	So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
L488571	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
L488570	u7492	m506	GALE	Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
L488569	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
L488568	u7492	m506	GALE	Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
L489033	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Catch him, or kill him.
L489032	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Oh yeah, how?
L489031	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
L489030	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	How is that good news?
L489029	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
L489028	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
L489027	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	What did you know about your mother?
L489026	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Hmm.
L489025	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
L489024	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
L489023	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
L489022	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	What do you mean?
L489021	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
L489020	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Excuse me?
L489019	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	To me Hollywood is about death.
L489018	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
L489017	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
L489016	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Did you request this case?
L489015	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
L489014	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
L489013	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
L489012	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	You seem to like movies, Detective.
L489011	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	You mean like, movie trilogies?
L489010	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	What do you know about trilogies?
L488887	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Absolutely.
L488886	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Are you sure?
L488883	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
L488882	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
L488980	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
L488979	u7491	m506	DEWEY	And what made you think it was Sidney?
L488978	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
L488876	u7491	m506	DEWEY	No.
L488875	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
L488874	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
L488871	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	What?  When?
L488870	u7491	m506	DEWEY	The killer called her.
L488869	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
L488864	u7491	m506	DEWEY	There's someone here who wants to help.
L488863	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	What Rielly?
L488862	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Detective Kincaid?
L488851	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Is that a threat?
L488850	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
L488849	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Is that a threat, Detective?
L488846	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
L488845	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
L488844	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What does this have to do with Sid?
L488843	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
L488839	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
L488838	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
L488835	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
L488834	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
L488615	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
L488614	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
L488608	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Yeah. A real tragedy.
L489166	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
L489165	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
L489163	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
L489162	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
L489161	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
L489133	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
L489132	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	They've got her!
L489131	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Where's Gale?
L489115	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
L489114	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Where are you Dewey?
L489113	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sid I can see you!
L489112	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
L489111	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
L489110	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yeah?
L488960	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
L488959	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
L488952	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
L488951	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
L488950	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
L488908	u7491	m506	DEWEY	No.
L488907	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I can see nothing's changed.
L488893	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
L488892	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
L488889	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
L488888	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
L488885	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
L488884	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
L488861	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Follow me.
L488860	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
L488859	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What?
L488858	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
L488857	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
L489170	u7492	m506	GALE	Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
L489169	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
L489058	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Who is it?
L489057	u7492	m506	GALE	Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
L488967	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Nevermind, what'd you two find?
L488966	u7492	m506	GALE	Sidney, what happened?
L488906	u7492	m506	GALE	I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
L488905	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Do you want us to come with you?
L488904	u7492	m506	GALE	I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
L488880	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Just Jennifer.  And you.
L488879	u7492	m506	GALE	Has anyone else every used your phone?
L488878	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
L488877	u7492	m506	GALE	Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
L488868	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
L488867	u7492	m506	GALE	Thank you.
L488825	u7491	m506	DEWEY	GALE BEHIND YOU!
L488824	u7492	m506	GALE	What?
L488823	u7491	m506	DEWEY	OH. OH GOD. GALE --
L488805	u7492	m506	GALE	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
L488804	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
L488774	u7492	m506	GALE	Fuck!
L488773	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Gale, your engine's still running.
L488772	u7492	m506	GALE	Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
L488771	u7491	m506	DEWEY	You're not a detective.
L488770	u7492	m506	GALE	I happen to work for the police god dammit!
L488769	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Stop following me.
L488768	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I'm on duty.
L488767	u7492	m506	GALE	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
L488766	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Jennifer needs me.
L488765	u7492	m506	GALE	And who is that?
L488764	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
L488763	u7492	m506	GALE	Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
L488762	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
L488761	u7492	m506	GALE	I'm sorry, this is too good!
L488760	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
L488759	u7492	m506	GALE	Someone stole Sid's file?
L488758	u7491	m506	DEWEY	The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
L488757	u7492	m506	GALE	And?
L488756	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
L488755	u7492	m506	GALE	Always.
L488754	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Off the record.
L488753	u7492	m506	GALE	All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
L488752	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
L488751	u7492	m506	GALE	Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
L488750	u7491	m506	DEWEY	You used to say that was our strength.
L488749	u7492	m506	GALE	It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
L488748	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
L488747	u7492	m506	GALE	It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
L488746	u7491	m506	DEWEY	So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
L488745	u7492	m506	GALE	You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
L488744	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What about me?
L488743	u7492	m506	GALE	Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
L488742	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Why would the police come to you?
L488741	u7492	m506	GALE	Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
L488740	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Do you really mean it this time Gale?
L488739	u7492	m506	GALE	This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
L488738	u7491	m506	DEWEY	You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
L488737	u7492	m506	GALE	Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
L488736	u7491	m506	DEWEY	They found another note?
L488611	u7492	m506	GALE	Show him.
L488610	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
L488609	u7492	m506	GALE	Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
L488999	u7494	m506	MILTON	"When we did the first 'Stab"" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?"
L488998	u7491	m506	DEWEY	But you know who she was.
L488997	u7494	m506	MILTON	What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
L488994	u7494	m506	MILTON	I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
L488993	u7491	m506	DEWEY	No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
L488992	u7494	m506	MILTON	What's your point?
L488985	u7494	m506	MILTON	Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
L488984	u7491	m506	DEWEY	So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
L488567	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Sure.
L488566	u7492	m506	GALE	Would you excuse me for a moment?
L488565	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
L488564	u7492	m506	GALE	Your life?
L488563	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Honestly, my life.
L488561	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
L488560	u7492	m506	GALE	It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
L488559	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
L489042	u7492	m506	GALE	Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
L489041	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
L489040	u7492	m506	GALE	Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
L489039	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
L488996	u7492	m506	GALE	Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
L488995	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
L488991	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Good twist.
L488990	u7492	m506	GALE	Nobody said she was an actor.
L488928	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Bitch.
L488927	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
L488926	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
L488925	u7492	m506	GALE	Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
L488924	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Basements creep me out.
L488923	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Gale Weathers would find a way. 
L488922	u7492	m506	GALE	Possibly.
L488921	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	There a story in that building?
L488920	u7492	m506	GALE	No really?
L488919	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Need to get in that building?
L488918	u7492	m506	GALE	Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
L488917	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	That's funny.
L488916	u7492	m506	GALE	And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
L488915	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
L488914	u7492	m506	GALE	None.
L488913	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
L488912	u7492	m506	GALE	I am Gale Weathers!
L488911	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
L488910	u7492	m506	GALE	What the hell are you doing?
L488909	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Geez.
L488821	u7492	m506	GALE	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
L488820	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
L488818	u7492	m506	GALE	I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
L488817	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
L488816	u7492	m506	GALE	Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
L488811	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Oh shit it's my cell!
L488810	u7492	m506	GALE	Who's phone?
L488798	u7492	m506	GALE	I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
L488797	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
L488788	u7492	m506	GALE	Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
L488787	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
L488786	u7492	m506	GALE	AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
L488785	u7492	m506	GALE	Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
L488784	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
L488783	u7492	m506	GALE	Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
L488782	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
L489009	u7494	m506	MILTON	I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
L489008	u7492	m506	GALE	Are you saying she was-
L489007	u7494	m506	MILTON	It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
L489006	u7492	m506	GALE	Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
L489005	u7494	m506	MILTON	Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
L489004	u7492	m506	GALE	I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
L489003	u7494	m506	MILTON	Yeah.
L489002	u7492	m506	GALE	Just because you knew her?
L489001	u7494	m506	MILTON	Get real, that would make me a suspect!
L489000	u7492	m506	GALE	And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
L488987	u7494	m506	MILTON	Who?
L488986	u7492	m506	GALE	Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
L488631	u7492	m506	GALE	They're the ones who approved it.
L488630	u7494	m506	MILTON	Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
L488629	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh come on! Why the hostility?
L488628	u7494	m506	MILTON	Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
L488625	u7494	m506	MILTON	GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
L488624	u7492	m506	GALE	Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
L488781	u7498	m506	TOM	You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
L488780	u7492	m506	GALE	I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
L488779	u7498	m506	TOM	Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
L488778	u7492	m506	GALE	Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
L488777	u7498	m506	TOM	Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
L488776	u7492	m506	GALE	Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
L488775	u7498	m506	TOM	Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
L489126	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	GALE WATCHOUT!
L489125	u7492	m506	GALE	Let's get out of here!
L489124	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I know!
L489123	u7492	m506	GALE	I know! He killed Kincaid!
L489122	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Gale he's got Dewey!
L488969	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	What are you talking about?
L488968	u7492	m506	GALE	We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
L488891	u7492	m506	GALE	Who's this.
L488890	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
L488873	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	"Oh, you know, the usual small talk, ""What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"""
L488872	u7492	m506	GALE	What'd he say?
L488866	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
L488865	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
L489156	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
L489155	u7495	m506	ROMAN	See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
L489152	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
L489151	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
L489150	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
L489147	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
L489146	u7495	m506	ROMAN	I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
L489145	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
L489144	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
L488702	u7495	m506	ROMAN	My movie.
L488701	u7496	m506	SARAH	What?  What movie?
L488700	u7495	m506	ROMAN	It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
L488699	u7496	m506	SARAH	Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
L488698	u7495	m506	ROMAN	It is in my script.
L488697	u7496	m506	SARAH	Roman that's not the line.
L488696	u7495	m506	ROMAN	It's Sarah.
L488695	u7496	m506	SARAH	I'm hanging up right now.
L488694	u7495	m506	ROMAN	But you know my favorite name?
L488693	u7496	m506	SARAH	Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
L488692	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
L488691	u7496	m506	SARAH	This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
L488690	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Who's this?
L488689	u7496	m506	SARAH	Who's this?
L488688	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Hello.
L488687	u7496	m506	SARAH	Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
L488686	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Page 22, Candy's big moment.
L488685	u7496	m506	SARAH	Huh, fine.
L488684	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
L488683	u7496	m506	SARAH	I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
L488682	u7495	m506	ROMAN	You're not happy with your part.
L488681	u7496	m506	SARAH	What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
L488680	u7495	m506	ROMAN	All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
L488679	u7496	m506	SARAH	Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
L488678	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
L488677	u7496	m506	SARAH	Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
L488674	u7496	m506	SARAH	Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
L488673	u7499	m506	TYSON	No.
L488672	u7496	m506	SARAH	Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
L488671	u7499	m506	TYSON	Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
L488593	u7499	m506	TYSON	I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
L488592	u7496	m506	SARAH	Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
L488591	u7499	m506	TYSON	"SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. ""What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident""."
L488590	u7496	m506	SARAH	What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
L488585	u7499	m506	TYSON	And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
L488584	u7496	m506	SARAH	Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
L489109	u7500	m506	VOICE	It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
L489108	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
L489107	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I thought you wanted me here?
L489106	u7500	m506	VOICE	You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
L489105	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Alright, I'm here. Now what?
L489104	u7500	m506	VOICE	You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
L489103	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yeah?
L489101	u7500	m506	VOICE	I'll call you, when you're on your way.
L489100	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	WHERE?
L489099	u7500	m506	VOICE	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
L489098	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Where?
L489093	u7500	m506	VOICE	I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
L489092	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	You're dead!
L489088	u7500	m506	VOICE	Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
L489087	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	How do I know their voices are --
L489086	u7500	m506	VOICE	Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
L489085	u7500	m506	VOICE	Go there.
L489084	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yes.
L489083	u7500	m506	VOICE	Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
L489081	u7500	m506	VOICE	The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
L489080	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Who is this?
L489079	u7500	m506	VOICE	{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
L488663	u7500	m506	VOICE	Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
L488662	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
L488661	u7500	m506	VOICE	No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
L488660	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	The final act? Well let's play asshole!
L488659	u7500	m506	VOICE	Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
L488658	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
L488657	u7500	m506	VOICE	Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
L488656	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
L488655	u7500	m506	VOICE	I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
L488654	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	W-what do you want?
L488653	u7500	m506	VOICE	Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
L488651	u7501	m506	WOMAN	It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
L488650	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Who the fuck is this?
L488649	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
L488648	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I'm sorry, your voice.
L488647	u7501	m506	WOMAN	No I need to call you. Just you.
L488646	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Well then the people you need to call are the police.
L488645	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
L488644	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Are you sure?
L488643	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Laura I think I just killed somebody.
L488642	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
L488641	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Hello?
L487514	u7516	m507	STU	I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
L487513	u7502	m507	BILLY	FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
L487507	u7502	m507	BILLY	Where the fuck did she go?
L487506	u7516	m507	STU	I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
L487503	u7516	m507	STU	Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
L487502	u7502	m507	BILLY	She can't get both of us.
L487499	u7516	m507	STU	She looked dead. Still does.
L487498	u7502	m507	BILLY	I thought she was dead.
L487495	u7516	m507	STU	No, it's not.
L487494	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's on the table.
L487492	u7502	m507	BILLY	Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
L487491	u7516	m507	STU	That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
L487488	u7516	m507	STU	Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
L487487	u7502	m507	BILLY	And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
L487486	u7516	m507	STU	Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
L487485	u7502	m507	BILLY	What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
L487477	u7516	m507	STU	Yeah...
L487476	u7502	m507	BILLY	Ready?
L487475	u7502	m507	BILLY	You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
L487474	u7516	m507	STU	This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
L487472	u7516	m507	STU	That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
L487471	u7502	m507	BILLY	Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
L487465	u7502	m507	BILLY	And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
L487464	u7516	m507	STU	Nope.
L487461	u7516	m507	STU	Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
L487460	u7502	m507	BILLY	Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
L487456	u7516	m507	STU	And if you get it right -- you die.
L487455	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
L487454	u7516	m507	STU	You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
L487444	u7516	m507	STU	Oh yeah.
L487443	u7502	m507	BILLY	Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
L487307	u7502	m507	BILLY	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
L487306	u7516	m507	STU	Dude. What are you doing here?
L487165	u7516	m507	STU	You know it.
L487164	u7502	m507	BILLY	You ready to party hard tonight?
L487163	u7516	m507	STU	Oh...
L487162	u7502	m507	BILLY	Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
L487161	u7516	m507	STU	I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
L487160	u7502	m507	BILLY	Duh... that's quick.
L487159	u7516	m507	STU	So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
L487158	u7502	m507	BILLY	Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
L487157	u7516	m507	STU	Piece of cake. She'll be there.
L487156	u7502	m507	BILLY	How'd you do?
L487050	u7516	m507	STU	Sorry.
L487049	u7502	m507	BILLY	You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
L487048	u7516	m507	STU	Owwww...
L486805	u7502	m507	BILLY	No one's saying you did.
L486804	u7516	m507	STU	I didn't kill anybody.
L486787	u7516	m507	STU	Sorry.
L486786	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's called tact, you fuckrag.
L486785	u7516	m507	STU	What? She asked.
L486920	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
L486919	u7502	m507	BILLY	No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
L486918	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
L486915	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
L486914	u7502	m507	BILLY	Yes, sir.
L486913	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	You rode your bike out there?
L486912	u7502	m507	BILLY	I just wanted to see her, that's all.
L486911	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
L487518	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
L487517	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
L487511	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
L487510	u7502	m507	BILLY	You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
L487509	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Are you alone in the house?
L487508	u7502	m507	BILLY	Hello?
L487483	u7502	m507	BILLY	Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
L487482	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Stop it!
L487481	u7502	m507	BILLY	Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
L487467	u7502	m507	BILLY	We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
L487466	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I don't understand...
L487463	u7502	m507	BILLY	Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
L487462	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why did you kill my mother?
L487453	u7502	m507	BILLY	We already played that game. You lost, remember?
L487452	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Fuck you.
L487451	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
L487434	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's okay. Give me the gun.
L487433	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	NO! Don't believe him.
L487430	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
L487429	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I thought you were...
L487379	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
L487378	u7502	m507	BILLY	You don't still think it was me?
L487377	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Uh-huh.
L487376	u7502	m507	BILLY	Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
L487375	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
L487374	u7502	m507	BILLY	I called my dad.
L487373	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
L487372	u7502	m507	BILLY	What?
L487371	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Who did you call?
L487337	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Yeah... I think so.
L487336	u7502	m507	BILLY	Are you serious?
L487335	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You heard me.
L487334	u7502	m507	BILLY	What?
L487333	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Or even a good porno.
L487332	u7502	m507	BILLY	Sshh... it's okay.
L487330	u7502	m507	BILLY	Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
L487329	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I wanna let go. I do...
L487328	u7502	m507	BILLY	Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
L487327	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But this is life. This isn't a movie.
L487326	u7502	m507	BILLY	Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
L487325	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
L487324	u7502	m507	BILLY	Oh Sidney...
L487323	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
L487322	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
L487321	u7502	m507	BILLY	You lost your mom...
L487320	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
L487319	u7502	m507	BILLY	So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
L487318	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So...
L487311	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's okay. We need to talk.
L487310	u7502	m507	BILLY	Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
L487070	u7502	m507	BILLY	You have to move on, Sid.
L487069	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
L487068	u7502	m507	BILLY	When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
L487067	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
L487066	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's been a year since she died.
L487065	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
L487064	u7502	m507	BILLY	Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
L487063	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No...
L487062	u7502	m507	BILLY	Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
L487061	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You know that's not true.
L487060	u7502	m507	BILLY	Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
L487059	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'm so sorry... please understand.
L487058	u7502	m507	BILLY	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
L487057	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
L487056	u7502	m507	BILLY	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
L487055	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
L487053	u7502	m507	BILLY	Hey, hey, it's just me.
L487052	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Jesus, SHIT!
L486865	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	He's here. He's trying to kill me...
L486864	u7502	m507	BILLY	I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
L486863	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Oh Billy... Please... God...
L486741	u7502	m507	BILLY	What's that?
L486740	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
L486737	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm going... I'm going.
L486736	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You know what my dad will do to you?
L486733	u7502	m507	BILLY	No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
L486732	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
L486731	u7502	m507	BILLY	"Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid ""R"" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television."
L486730	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Oh it did?
L486729	u7502	m507	BILLY	And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
L486728	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Now that it's out of your system.
L486727	u7502	m507	BILLY	It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
L486726	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What are you doing here?
L486725	u7502	m507	BILLY	Close call.
L486712	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'll only stay a sec.
L486711	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	My dad's in the other room.
L486710	u7502	m507	BILLY	You sleep in THAT?
L486709	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What are you doing here?
L486708	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
L486707	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Billy? What the...
L486688	u7510	m507	MAN	Your call.
L486687	u7503	m507	CASEY	Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
L486686	u7510	m507	MAN	There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
L486685	u7503	m507	CASEY	What?
L486684	u7510	m507	MAN	What door am I at?
L486683	u7510	m507	MAN	Answer the question and I will.
L486682	u7503	m507	CASEY	...leave me alone... please...
L486680	u7510	m507	MAN	Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
L486679	u7503	m507	CASEY	You tricked me...
L486678	u7510	m507	MAN	Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
L486677	u7503	m507	CASEY	It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
L486676	u7510	m507	MAN	Afraid not.
L486675	u7503	m507	CASEY	No it's not. It was Jason.
L486674	u7510	m507	MAN	I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
L486672	u7510	m507	MAN	Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
L486671	u7503	m507	CASEY	...please... no...
L486670	u7510	m507	MAN	Then answer the question. Same category.
L486669	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please go away! Leave us alone!
L486668	u7510	m507	MAN	But you're doing so well.
L486667	u7503	m507	CASEY	NOOOO....
L486666	u7510	m507	MAN	Now for the real question.
L486665	u7510	m507	MAN	YES!
L486664	u7503	m507	CASEY	Michael... Michael Myers.
L486662	u7503	m507	CASEY	I can't think.
L486661	u7510	m507	MAN	What's his name?
L486660	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please..stop...
L486659	u7510	m507	MAN	Come on, yes you do.
L486658	u7503	m507	CASEY	I don't know...
L486657	u7510	m507	MAN	Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
L486656	u7503	m507	CASEY	No...
L486655	u7510	m507	MAN	Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
L486654	u7503	m507	CASEY	Don't do this. I can't...
L486653	u7510	m507	MAN	I'll even give you a warm up question.
L486652	u7503	m507	CASEY	...please...
L486651	u7510	m507	MAN	It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
L486650	u7503	m507	CASEY	No... please.
L486649	u7510	m507	MAN	Come on. It'll be fun.
L486648	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please don't do this...
L486646	u7510	m507	MAN	Turn off the light.
L486645	u7503	m507	CASEY	What kind of game?
L486644	u7510	m507	MAN	Which is it?
L486643	u7503	m507	CASEY	NOOO!
L486642	u7510	m507	MAN	Then he dies. Right now.
L486641	u7503	m507	CASEY	No...
L486640	u7510	m507	MAN	I wanna play a game.
L486639	u7503	m507	CASEY	Why are you doing this?
L486638	u7510	m507	MAN	That all depends on you.
L486637	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please don't hurt him.
L486636	u7510	m507	MAN	Guess.
L486635	u7503	m507	CASEY	Where are you?
L486632	u7510	m507	MAN	Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
L486631	u7503	m507	CASEY	How do you know his name?
L486630	u7510	m507	MAN	His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
L486629	u7503	m507	CASEY	So you better leave.
L486628	u7510	m507	MAN	I believe you...
L486627	u7503	m507	CASEY	I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
L486626	u7510	m507	MAN	I'm getting scared.
L486625	u7503	m507	CASEY	I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
L486624	u7510	m507	MAN	Sure...
L486623	u7503	m507	CASEY	I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
L486622	u7510	m507	MAN	I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
L486621	u7503	m507	CASEY	My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
L486620	u7510	m507	MAN	Or else what?
L486619	u7503	m507	CASEY	Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
L486615	u7510	m507	MAN	TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
L486614	u7503	m507	CASEY	What do you want?
L486613	u7510	m507	MAN	They'd never make it in time.
L486612	u7503	m507	CASEY	I'm two seconds from calling the police.
L486611	u7510	m507	MAN	More of a game, really.
L486610	u7503	m507	CASEY	Is this some kind of a joke?
L486609	u7510	m507	MAN	NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
L486608	u7503	m507	CASEY	Listen, asshole...
L486607	u7503	m507	CASEY	No-bored.
L486606	u7510	m507	MAN	You getting scared?
L486605	u7503	m507	CASEY	Dial someone else, okay?
L486604	u7510	m507	MAN	To talk.
L486603	u7503	m507	CASEY	What do you want?
L486602	u7510	m507	MAN	I told you not to hang up on me.
L486601	u7503	m507	CASEY	Yes?
L486600	u7510	m507	MAN	Don't...

L486594	u7510	m507	MAN	What do you think I said?
L486593	u7503	m507	CASEY	That's not what you said.
L486592	u7510	m507	MAN	I want to now who I'm talking to.

L486587	u7503	m507	CASEY	No.

L486585	u7503	m507	CASEY	Why? You wanna ask me out?
L486584	u7510	m507	MAN	So, you gotta boyfriend?

L486582	u7510	m507	MAN	Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
L486581	u7503	m507	CASEY	Yeah... Freddy Krueger.

L486578	u7510	m507	MAN	Guess.
L486577	u7503	m507	CASEY	Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
L486576	u7510	m507	MAN	You have to have a favorite.
L486575	u7503	m507	CASEY	I don't know.
L486574	u7510	m507	MAN	What's your favorite scary movie?
L486573	u7503	m507	CASEY	Uh-huh.

L487394	u7506	m507	GALE	Sidney's father?
L487393	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
L487388	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I don't think you're so bad.
L487387	u7506	m507	GALE	People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
L487386	u7506	m507	GALE	What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
L487385	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
L487384	u7506	m507	GALE	I like it. It's... sexy.
L487383	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
L487382	u7506	m507	GALE	So is Dewey your real name?
L487360	u7504	m507	DEWEY	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.

L487355	u7506	m507	GALE	What kind of lead?
L487354	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.

L487120	u7506	m507	GALE	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
L487119	u7504	m507	DEWEY	If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

L487116	u7504	m507	DEWEY	No, not yet.
L487115	u7506	m507	GALE	Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
L487114	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
L487113	u7506	m507	GALE	Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
L487112	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
L487111	u7506	m507	GALE	Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
L487108	u7506	m507	GALE	Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
L487107	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
L487106	u7506	m507	GALE	I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
L487105	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
L487104	u7506	m507	GALE	And why is that? Has something happened?
L487103	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
L487102	u7506	m507	GALE	Productive. So they're closing down the school?
L487101	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
L487100	u7506	m507	GALE	Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
L487274	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
L487273	u7517	m507	TATUM	What is she doing here?
L487242	u7517	m507	TATUM	Shit.
L487241	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
L487240	u7517	m507	TATUM	No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
L487193	u7517	m507	TATUM	Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
L487192	u7504	m507	DEWEY	A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
L486932	u7517	m507	TATUM	I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
L486931	u7504	m507	DEWEY	What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
L486927	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Hold up a sec...
L486926	u7517	m507	TATUM	Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
L486888	u7517	m507	TATUM	Yes, you doofus.
L486887	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Does mom know?
L486884	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
L486883	u7517	m507	TATUM	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
L486882	u7504	m507	DEWEY	What are you doing here?
L487289	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Not yet.
L487288	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Should I be worried?
L487287	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Afraid not.
L487286	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Have they found my father?
L487239	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
L487238	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Yeah.
L487237	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You girls ready.
L487199	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
L487198	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
L487195	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
L487194	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
L486985	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	And my Dad? Any word on him?
L486984	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
L486983	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
L486982	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
L486949	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
L486948	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Any word on my Dad?
L486905	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
L486904	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I don't know. I guess.
L486903	u7504	m507	DEWEY	He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
L486902	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	At the airport.
L486901	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You're sure it was the Hilton?
L486900	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Did you reach my Dad?
L486880	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	...yeah...
L486879	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
L487218	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Yes, sir.
L487217	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
L487216	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
L487215	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
L487214	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
L487213	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
L487212	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You think he could still be in town?
L487211	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
L487210	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Have you contacted the bureau?
L487209	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
L487208	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
L487207	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
L487206	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Keeping my eye on Sidney.
L487205	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
L487099	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Yes, sir, sheriff.
L487098	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
L486929	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We haven't located her Dad yet.
L486928	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	She staying with you?
L486925	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
L486924	u7504	m507	DEWEY	They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
L486923	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	What about the cellular phone bill?
L486922	u7504	m507	DEWEY	That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
L486877	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
L486876	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She's tough.
L486875	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	How is she?
L486874	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Drive by patrol.
L486873	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	What were you doing out here?
L486872	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I was first to respond.
L486870	u7504	m507	DEWEY	He's her boyfriend.
L486869	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
L486868	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
L486768	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	How is everything?
L486767	u7504	m507	DEWEY	It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
L486704	u7511	m507	MOTHER	Not my daughter... not my...
L486703	u7505	m507	FATHER	Casey! Casey!
L486702	u7511	m507	MOTHER	I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
L486701	u7505	m507	FATHER	Where is she?
L486698	u7511	m507	MOTHER	The phone's dead.
L486697	u7505	m507	FATHER	Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
L486696	u7505	m507	FATHER	Call the police.
L486695	u7511	m507	MOTHER	Where is she?
L486694	u7505	m507	FATHER	Casey? Casey?
L486693	u7511	m507	MOTHER	What is it? Where's Casey?
L486692	u7505	m507	FATHER	Jesus...
L486691	u7511	m507	MOTHER	I told you to send it back.
L486690	u7505	m507	FATHER	That fish smelled strong.
L487251	u7506	m507	GALE	As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
L487250	u7509	m507	KENNY	About thirty seconds.
L487249	u7506	m507	GALE	What's the delay?
L487248	u7509	m507	KENNY	The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
L487247	u7506	m507	GALE	Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
L487246	u7509	m507	KENNY	What's the plan?
L487030	u7506	m507	GALE	Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
L487029	u7509	m507	KENNY	But it's so much easier when we make it up.
L487028	u7506	m507	GALE	If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
L487027	u7509	m507	KENNY	When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
L487026	u7506	m507	GALE	No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
L487025	u7509	m507	KENNY	You want to go live?
L487024	u7506	m507	GALE	Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
L486892	u7506	m507	GALE	Jesus! The camera-hurry!
L486891	u7509	m507	KENNY	What? What?
L487015	u7506	m507	GALE	But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
L487014	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I saw him leaving wearing it.
L487013	u7506	m507	GALE	He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
L487012	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
L487011	u7506	m507	GALE	Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
L487010	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Has his story changed?
L487009	u7506	m507	GALE	Many times.
L487008	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Have you talked to Cotton?
L487007	u7506	m507	GALE	I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
L487006	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
L487005	u7506	m507	GALE	He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
L487004	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Do you still think he's innocent?
L487003	u7506	m507	GALE	What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
L487002	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
L487001	u7506	m507	GALE	Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
L487000	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You owe my mother.
L486999	u7506	m507	GALE	I owe you shit.
L486998	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Please. You owe me.
L486997	u7506	m507	GALE	Forget it.
L486996	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Off the record. No cameras.
L486995	u7506	m507	GALE	Kenny. Camera. Now.
L486994	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I want to talk to you.
L486993	u7506	m507	GALE	Just stay back.
L486992	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'm not here to fight.
L486944	u7506	m507	GALE	I'll send you a copy.
L486943	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'll look for it.
L486942	u7506	m507	GALE	It'll be out later this year.
L486941	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	How's the book?
L486940	u7506	m507	GALE	Yes, that's right.
L486939	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
L487085	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Ricki Lake.
L487084	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Where do you get this shit?
L487083	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
L487082	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
L487081	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
L487080	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	You're evil.
L487079	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
L487078	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
L487077	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
L487076	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	And why would she do that?
L487075	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
L487074	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
L487073	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Why would she lie about it?
L487072	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
L486970	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Who are you?
L486969	u7510	m507	MAN	Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
L486968	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	LEAVEMEALONE!
L486967	u7510	m507	MAN	Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
L486965	u7510	m507	MAN	Hello Sidney.
L486964	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Hello?
L486858	u7510	m507	MAN	If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
L486857	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
L486856	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What am I doing?
L486855	u7510	m507	MAN	Uh-huh.
L486854	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Can you see me right now?
L486853	u7510	m507	MAN	Right here.
L486852	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So where are you?
L486850	u7510	m507	MAN	That's the original part.
L486849	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why would you call me from my front porch?
L486848	u7510	m507	MAN	Your front porch.
L486847	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So where are you?
L486846	u7510	m507	MAN	The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
L486845	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So who are you?
L486844	u7510	m507	MAN	Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
L486843	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
L486842	u7510	m507	MAN	Are you alone in the house?
L486841	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
L486840	u7510	m507	MAN	And why is that?
L486839	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
L486838	u7510	m507	MAN	What's your favorite scary movie?
L486837	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
L486836	u7510	m507	MAN	Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
L486835	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
L486834	u7510	m507	MAN	Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
L486833	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I have no idea.
L486724	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	Sleep tight, sweetie.
L486723	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Have a good trip.
L486721	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Got it.
L486720	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	...so call if you need me.
L486719	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	...out at the airport...
L486718	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
L486717	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No you didn't.
L486716	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	I heard screaming.
L486715	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Can you knock?
L486714	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	Are you okay?
L486803	u7513	m507	RANDY	Twice.
L486802	u7517	m507	TATUM	I thought Blockbuster fired you.
L486801	u7513	m507	RANDY	Working, thank you.
L486800	u7517	m507	TATUM	Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
L486799	u7513	m507	RANDY	Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
L486798	u7517	m507	TATUM	Stu was with me last night.
L487530	u7513	m507	RANDY	You got it.
L487529	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
L487414	u7513	m507	RANDY	Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
L487413	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Don't come any closer.
L487412	u7513	m507	RANDY	Don't shoot. It's me.
L487411	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Stop. Right there.
L487265	u7513	m507	RANDY	She's the Scream Queen.
L487264	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
L487421	u7513	m507	RANDY	No, Sid.
L487420	u7516	m507	STU	Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
L487419	u7513	m507	RANDY	Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
L487418	u7516	m507	STU	His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
L487352	u7516	m507	STU	I'll be right back.
L487351	u7513	m507	RANDY	Yeah.
L487350	u7516	m507	STU	Wanna another beer?
L487349	u7513	m507	RANDY	"There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say ""I'll be right back."""
L487345	u7513	m507	RANDY	Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
L487344	u7516	m507	STU	I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
L487315	u7516	m507	STU	Like you had one.
L487314	u7513	m507	RANDY	There goes my chance with Sid.
L487313	u7516	m507	STU	He came to make up.
L487312	u7513	m507	RANDY	What's Leatherface doing here?
L487281	u7516	m507	STU	I can cry on cue.
L487280	u7513	m507	RANDY	We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
L487263	u7513	m507	RANDY	I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
L487262	u7516	m507	STU	I thought everything was checked out.
L487191	u7513	m507	RANDY	It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
L487190	u7516	m507	STU	And what would be your motive?
L487189	u7513	m507	RANDY	You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
L487185	u7513	m507	RANDY	So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
L487184	u7516	m507	STU	Which is you...
L487183	u7513	m507	RANDY	Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
L487182	u7516	m507	STU	I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
L487181	u7513	m507	RANDY	Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
L487180	u7516	m507	STU	She's saving herself for you.
L487179	u7513	m507	RANDY	Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
L487178	u7516	m507	STU	So what's his reason?
L487177	u7513	m507	RANDY	There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
L487176	u7516	m507	STU	Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
L487175	u7513	m507	RANDY	Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
L487174	u7516	m507	STU	The why'd the police let him go?
L487173	u7513	m507	RANDY	You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
L487172	u7516	m507	STU	It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
L487171	u7513	m507	RANDY	If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
L487170	u7516	m507	STU	What?
L487169	u7513	m507	RANDY	Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
L487168	u7516	m507	STU	You coming tonight?
L487167	u7513	m507	RANDY	We had a run in the mass murder section.
L487166	u7516	m507	STU	Jesus, this place is packed.
L486808	u7513	m507	RANDY	Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
L486807	u7516	m507	STU	I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
L486806	u7513	m507	RANDY	"Besides --  ""Takes a man to do something like that."""
L486797	u7513	m507	RANDY	It would certainly improve your high school Q.
L486796	u7516	m507	STU	What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
L486795	u7513	m507	RANDY	And are the police aware you dated the victim?
L486792	u7513	m507	RANDY	Before she dumped him for Steve.
L486791	u7516	m507	STU	For about two seconds.
L486781	u7516	m507	STU	Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
L486780	u7513	m507	RANDY	That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
L487516	u7516	m507	STU	Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
L487515	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
L487459	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You'll never get away with this.
L487458	u7516	m507	STU	"The official term is ""psychotic""."
L487457	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You're crazy -- both of you.
L487450	u7516	m507	STU	It's all part of the game.
L487449	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why are you doing this?
L487448	u7516	m507	STU	Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
L487309	u7516	m507	STU	You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
L487308	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
L487139	u7516	m507	STU	Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
L487138	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Yeah, okay... whatever.
L487137	u7516	m507	STU	Remember, there's safety in numbers.
L487133	u7516	m507	STU	My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
L487132	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Are you serious?
L487131	u7516	m507	STU	And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
L487047	u7516	m507	STU	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
L487046	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why are they doing this?
L486790	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
L486789	u7516	m507	STU	You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
L487236	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Deal.
L487235	u7517	m507	TATUM	There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
L487234	u7517	m507	TATUM	Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
L487233	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	TATUM!
L487232	u7517	m507	TATUM	Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
L487231	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
L487230	u7517	m507	TATUM	"Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, ""Eight is enough..."""
L487229	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No way.
L487228	u7517	m507	TATUM	"During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" It's a real turn on."
L487227	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
L487226	u7517	m507	TATUM	"Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman."
L487225	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Who?
L487224	u7517	m507	TATUM	With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
L487223	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What do you think about when you're having sex?
L487222	u7517	m507	TATUM	Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
L487221	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
L487220	u7517	m507	TATUM	You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
L487219	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
L487202	u7517	m507	TATUM	He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
L487201	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Is Billy going to be there tonight?
L487197	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Oh, god...
L487196	u7517	m507	TATUM	Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
L487155	u7517	m507	TATUM	Come on, let's rock.
L487154	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
L487153	u7517	m507	TATUM	Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
L487152	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
L487151	u7517	m507	TATUM	Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
L487150	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	And you believe it?
L487149	u7517	m507	TATUM	It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
L487148	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
L487147	u7517	m507	TATUM	You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
L487146	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
L487145	u7517	m507	TATUM	I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
L487144	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So you think my mom was a slut too?
L487143	u7517	m507	TATUM	Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
L487136	u7517	m507	TATUM	Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
L487135	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I don't know...
L487134	u7517	m507	TATUM	This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
L487126	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It was him, Tatum. I know it.
L487125	u7517	m507	TATUM	It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
L487041	u7517	m507	TATUM	Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
L487040	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I bet he's pissed.
L487039	u7517	m507	TATUM	Shit, what is he doing here?
L487038	u7517	m507	TATUM	I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
L487037	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
L487032	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
L487031	u7517	m507	TATUM	Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
L486990	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
L486989	u7517	m507	TATUM	Come on, Sid.
L486962	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's alright. I'll get it.
L486961	u7517	m507	TATUM	Take a message.
L486956	u7517	m507	TATUM	I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
L486955	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	He was there, Tatum.
L486954	u7517	m507	TATUM	Do you really think Billy did it?
L486953	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, nothing's like it used to be.
L486952	u7517	m507	TATUM	Just like old times, ain't it?
L486951	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
L486886	u7517	m507	TATUM	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
L486885	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
L486828	u7517	m507	TATUM	Bye.
L486827	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Whatever. Just hurry.
L486826	u7517	m507	TATUM	Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
L486825	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'm not worried.
L486824	u7517	m507	TATUM	Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
L486823	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's past seven.
L486822	u7517	m507	TATUM	Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
L486818	u7517	m507	TATUM	Later.
L486817	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Thanks, Tatum.
L486816	u7517	m507	TATUM	I'll be there by seven. I promise
L486815	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
L486814	u7517	m507	TATUM	Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
L486813	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Tell your mom I said thanks.
L486812	u7517	m507	TATUM	No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
L486811	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
L486783	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	How do you gut someone?
L486782	u7517	m507	TATUM	Or a man's mentality.
L486756	u7517	m507	TATUM	They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
L486755	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	They think it's school-related?
L486754	u7517	m507	TATUM	Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
L486753	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Do they know who did it?
L486752	u7517	m507	TATUM	Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
L486751	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
L486750	u7517	m507	TATUM	And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
L486749	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No way.
L486748	u7517	m507	TATUM	Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
L486747	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What happened?
L486746	u7517	m507	TATUM	Do you believe this shit?
L487271	u7516	m507	STU	Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
L487270	u7517	m507	TATUM	What am I? The beer wench?
L487269	u7516	m507	STU	I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
L487267	u7517	m507	TATUM	Tits -- see.
L487266	u7516	m507	STU	With that set of lungs -- she should be.
L487245	u7516	m507	STU	Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
L487244	u7517	m507	TATUM	That's mature.
L487130	u7516	m507	STU	Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
L487129	u7517	m507	TATUM	For once, Stu, drop it.
L487128	u7516	m507	STU	Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
L487044	u7516	m507	STU	Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
L487043	u7517	m507	TATUM	You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
L486794	u7516	m507	STU	I did. He's full of shit.
L486793	u7517	m507	TATUM	I thought you dumped her for me.
L486779	u7517	m507	TATUM	That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
L486778	u7516	m507	STU	Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
L486774	u7516	m507	STU	I don't know, they just did.
L486773	u7517	m507	TATUM	Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
L496219	u7546	m510	ELLEN	You don't remember?
L496218	u7548	m510	MARTIN	For God's sake, what happened to me?
L496212	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I wouldn't have made it by myself.
L496211	u7548	m510	MARTIN	How did you get me out of there?
L496209	u7548	m510	MARTIN	I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
L496208	u7546	m510	ELLEN	What?
L496183	u7546	m510	ELLEN	...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
L496182	u7548	m510	MARTIN	You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
L496180	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
L496179	u7548	m510	MARTIN	It's important - he knows the last chapter.
L496177	u7546	m510	ELLEN	'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
L496176	u7548	m510	MARTIN	I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
L496131	u7546	m510	ELLEN	We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
L496130	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
L496104	u7546	m510	ELLEN	What are you talking about-
L496103	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
L496102	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
L496101	u7548	m510	MARTIN	You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
L496100	u7548	m510	MARTIN	It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
L496099	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Martin, what-
L496085	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
L496084	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
L496082	u7548	m510	MARTIN	"Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  ""There is something negative about the place...""  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!"
L496081	u7546	m510	ELLEN	This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
L496080	u7548	m510	MARTIN	During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
L496073	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Hi, darling.
L496072	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
L496010	u7546	m510	ELLEN	An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
L496009	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Maybe an animal.
L496008	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
L496007	u7548	m510	MARTIN	She was old.
L496006	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
L496005	u7548	m510	MARTIN	What?
L495956	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I haven't the slightest idea.
L495955	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Who's that?
L495953	u7546	m510	ELLEN	The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
L495952	u7548	m510	MARTIN	What? What am I supposed to sense?
L495951	u7546	m510	ELLEN	It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
L495950	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
L495949	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals...
L495947	u7546	m510	ELLEN	In the village.  Look what I found.
L495946	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Where have you been?
L495920	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
L495919	u7546	m510	ELLEN	But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
L495915	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
L495914	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Where have you been all day?
L495913	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
L495912	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
L495888	u7548	m510	MARTIN	No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
L495887	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
L495885	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Yeah... I have to go to town.
L495884	u7548	m510	MARTIN	So, did you sleep good?
L495868	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
L495867	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Now, what did I do to deserve this?
L495864	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
L495863	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
L495862	u7548	m510	MARTIN	You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
L495861	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Martin, it's not funny!
L495858	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Someone from the village.
L495857	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Who was that?
L495840	u7546	m510	ELLEN	If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
L495839	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
L495838	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
L495837	u7548	m510	MARTIN	So do I, believe me.
L495836	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I miss Tommi so much.
L495834	u7548	m510	MARTIN	"And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  ""With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."""
L495833	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
L495832	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
L495831	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
L495830	u7548	m510	MARTIN	What?
L495829	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Cherry-red Tears.
L495828	u7548	m510	MARTIN	We just have to make a new beginning.
L495827	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
L495826	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
L495825	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
L495822	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I just had a really strange experience.
L495821	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
L495820	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Making our very own solstice fire.
L495819	u7546	m510	ELLEN	What are you doing?
L495817	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
L495816	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Where are you going?
L495815	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Yes, daddy.
L495814	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
L495812	u7546	m510	ELLEN	My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
L495811	u7548	m510	MARTIN	My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
L495810	u7546	m510	ELLEN	You?
L495809	u7548	m510	MARTIN	I'll do it myself.
L495808	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Do you have a better idea?
L495807	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
L495806	u7546	m510	ELLEN	We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
L495805	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
L495799	u7548	m510	MARTIN	In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
L495798	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Do you know where fuse box is?
L495797	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Oh, damnit!
L495796	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Hey... the fuse.
L495795	u7548	m510	MARTIN	We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
L495794	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Maybe the antenna's broken.
L495792	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
L495791	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I mean the armchair!
L495790	u7548	m510	MARTIN	It still worked in town.
L495789	u7546	m510	ELLEN	What kind of a horrible thing is that?
L495781	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
L495780	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
L495779	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
L495778	u7548	m510	MARTIN	They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
L495777	u7546	m510	ELLEN	So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
L495776	u7548	m510	MARTIN	You'll never get away from me!
L495775	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Stop that!
L495762	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Oh God, Tommi...
L495761	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Ellen, move aside...
L495759	u7548	m510	MARTIN	What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
L495758	u7546	m510	ELLEN	You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
L495757	u7548	m510	MARTIN	I have to cut his windpipe...
L495751	u7548	m510	MARTIN	With you, my life began and with you shall it end...
L495750	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
L495748	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Come on, say it.  You know...
L495747	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Why else?
L496033	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
L496032	u7546	m510	ELLEN	But what is the truth?
L496031	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
L496030	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
L496029	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
L496016	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
L496015	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I really hate to bother him, but...
L496013	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Thank you.
L496012	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
L495937	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
L495936	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Ellen.
L496022	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
L496021	u7547	m510	LINDNER	Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
L496020	u7546	m510	ELLEN	1976.  What happened back then?
L496019	u7547	m510	LINDNER	You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
L495855	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
L495854	u7547	m510	LINDNER	I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
L495852	u7547	m510	LINDNER	Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
L495851	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Do I look like it that much?
L495850	u7547	m510	LINDNER	It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
L495849	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Ellen Straub.
L495848	u7547	m510	LINDNER	You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
L495847	u7546	m510	ELLEN	No, I've never seen him before.
L495846	u7547	m510	LINDNER	Does this dog here belong to you?
L495845	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Hello.  Can I help you?
L496112	u7551	m510	PROF. ROTH	We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
L496111	u7546	m510	ELLEN	It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
L496109	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
L496108	u7551	m510	PROF. ROTH	What?
L496107	u7546	m510	ELLEN	I've killed my husband!
L496106	u7551	m510	PROF. ROTH	Mrs. Straub!
L495894	u7551	m510	PROF. ROTH	A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
L495893	u7546	m510	ELLEN	And that is?
L495892	u7551	m510	PROF. ROTH	There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
L495891	u7546	m510	ELLEN	Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
L496159	u7547	m510	LINDNER	How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
L496158	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Hammer?
L496156	u7547	m510	LINDNER	Yes, something was...
L496155	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
L496154	u7547	m510	LINDNER	I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
L495944	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
L495943	u7547	m510	LINDNER	We should leave the past alone.
L495942	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	You didn't tell her!
L495940	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
L495939	u7547	m510	LINDNER	Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
L495935	u7549	m510	MRS. LINDNER	Just call me Elisabeth.
L495934	u7547	m510	LINDNER	Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
L495960	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
L495959	u7550	m510	PAUL	Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
L495738	u7550	m510	PAUL	I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
L495737	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Twenty-three, to be exact.
L495734	u7550	m510	PAUL	I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
L495733	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
L495730	u7550	m510	PAUL	Very funny.
L495729	u7548	m510	MARTIN	Tenth floor.
L495728	u7550	m510	PAUL	Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
L495717	u7548	m510	MARTIN	"Ladies and gentlemen: The ""Straub country-residence""."
L495716	u7550	m510	PAUL	Well, look here!
L502638	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.
L502637	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes, Dad.
L502636	u7614	m514	JACK	I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
L502635	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes, Dad.
L502634	u7614	m514	JACK	Are you sure?
L502633	u7608	m514	DANNY	No, Dad.
L502632	u7614	m514	JACK	Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
L502631	u7614	m514	JACK	What do you mean?
L502630	u7608	m514	DANNY	You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
L502629	u7614	m514	JACK	What?
L502628	u7608	m514	DANNY	Dad?
L502627	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
L502626	u7608	m514	DANNY	I guess so.
L502625	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
L502624	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do you like this hotel?
L502623	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes?
L502622	u7608	m514	DANNY	Dad?
L502621	u7614	m514	JACK	I can't.  I have too much to do.
L502620	u7608	m514	DANNY	Then why don't you go to sleep?
L502619	u7614	m514	JACK	No.  I'm just a little tired.
L502618	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do you feel bad?
L502617	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes.
L502616	u7608	m514	DANNY	I am, Dad.  Dad?
L502615	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.  I want you to have a good time.
L502614	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes, Dad.
L502613	u7614	m514	JACK	Are you having a good time?
L502612	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay.
L502611	u7614	m514	JACK	How's it going, Doc?
L502610	u7614	m514	JACK	Come here for a minute, first.
L502609	u7608	m514	DANNY	Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
L502332	u7614	m514	JACK	They had to, in order to survive.
L502331	u7608	m514	DANNY	You mean they ate each other up?
L502330	u7614	m514	JACK	There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
L502329	u7608	m514	DANNY	What was the Donner party?
L502328	u7614	m514	JACK	I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
L502324	u7614	m514	JACK	Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
L502323	u7608	m514	DANNY	I'm hungry.
L502322	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes?
L502321	u7608	m514	DANNY	Dad?
L502507	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
L502506	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
L502505	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	No I ain't.
L502504	u7608	m514	DANNY	You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
L502503	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Room 237?
L502502	u7608	m514	DANNY	What about Room 237?
L502501	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
L502500	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
L502499	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
L502498	u7608	m514	DANNY	Is there something bad here?
L502497	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
L502495	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Try to think what it was.
L502494	u7608	m514	DANNY	Maybe he showed me something.
L502493	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
L502492	u7608	m514	DANNY	I don't know.
L502490	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Do they know he tell you things?
L502489	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes.
L502488	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
L502487	u7608	m514	DANNY	It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
L502486	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	How does he tell you things?
L502485	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes.
L502484	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Is Tony the one that tells you things?
L502483	u7608	m514	DANNY	Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
L502482	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Who's Tony?
L502481	u7608	m514	DANNY	Tony.
L502480	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Who says you ain't supposed to?
L502479	u7608	m514	DANNY	I'm not supposed to.
L502478	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Why don't you want to talk about it?
L502466	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
L502465	u7608	m514	DANNY	Chocolate.
L502455	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502454	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Do you like ice cream, Doc?
L502428	u7608	m514	DANNY	French Fries and Ketchup.
L502427	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
L502426	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502425	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
L503069	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh!
L503068	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy!
L503067	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny!
L503066	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy... Mommy...!
L503065	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny, come here!
L503064	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy...
L503023	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L503022	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
L502832	u7619	m514	WENDY	Are you having a bad dream?
L502831	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.
L502830	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny... what's the matter, hon?
L502829	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.
L502828	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L502827	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny?
L502825	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L502824	u7619	m514	WENDY	If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
L502608	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay, Mom.
L502607	u7619	m514	WENDY	Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
L502606	u7608	m514	DANNY	I won't, Mom.
L502605	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
L502604	u7608	m514	DANNY	I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
L502603	u7619	m514	WENDY	Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
L502602	u7608	m514	DANNY	I won't make any noise.
L502601	u7619	m514	WENDY	Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
L502600	u7608	m514	DANNY	Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
L502599	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes?
L502598	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mom?
L502540	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502539	u7619	m514	WENDY	I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
L502538	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502537	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's so pretty.
L502536	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502535	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
L502533	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502532	u7619	m514	WENDY	Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
L502531	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay...oh!
L502530	u7619	m514	WENDY	Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
L502528	u7619	m514	WENDY	And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
L502527	u7608	m514	DANNY	All right.
L502526	u7619	m514	WENDY	The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
L502463	u7619	m514	WENDY	Okay.  You behave yourself.
L502462	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502407	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny, come on over here.
L502406	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502334	u7608	m514	DANNY	Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
L502333	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack...
L502327	u7619	m514	WENDY	Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
L502326	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay, Mom.
L502325	u7619	m514	WENDY	We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
L502290	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay.
L502289	u7619	m514	WENDY	We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
L502190	u7619	m514	WENDY	What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
L502189	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah, I guess so.
L502188	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
L502187	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
L502186	u7619	m514	WENDY	Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
L502185	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
L502184	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.
L502288	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Yes, I'd like you to.
L502287	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do I have to?
L502286	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
L502283	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
L502282	u7608	m514	DANNY	To my stomach.
L502281	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Where does he go?
L502280	u7608	m514	DANNY	Because he hides.
L502279	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Why not?
L502278	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502277	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
L502276	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Oh,
L502274	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
L502273	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Is Tony one of your animals?
L502272	u7608	m514	DANNY	Talking to Tony.
L502271	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
L502270	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
L502269	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
L502268	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes.
L502267	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
L502266	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502265	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
L502316	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
L502315	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	How did he manage to do that?
L502314	u7619	m514	WENDY	Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
L502313	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	What sort of injury did he have?
L502310	u7619	m514	WENDY	No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
L502309	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
L502308	u7619	m514	WENDY	Tony.
L502307	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
L502306	u7619	m514	WENDY	Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
L502305	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
L502300	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
L502299	u7619	m514	WENDY	But eh what was the matter with him?
L502297	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
L502296	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
L502295	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Thank you.
L502294	u7619	m514	WENDY	Please...
L502293	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Yes.
L502292	u7619	m514	WENDY	Shall we go into the living room?
L502597	u7610	m514	DOROTHY	Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
L502596	u7613	m514	HERMIE	Sure.
L502595	u7610	m514	DOROTHY	Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
L502594	u7613	m514	HERMIE	It's okay, really.
L502593	u7610	m514	DOROTHY	Well how can I repay you?
L502592	u7613	m514	HERMIE	Oh I wouldn't think of it.
L503004	u7611	m514	GRADY	You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
L503003	u7614	m514	JACK	There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
L503002	u7611	m514	GRADY	I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
L503001	u7614	m514	JACK	For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
L503000	u7611	m514	GRADY	Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
L502999	u7614	m514	JACK	Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
L502996	u7611	m514	GRADY	Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
L502995	u7614	m514	JACK	No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
L502990	u7614	m514	JACK	Grady... oh.
L502989	u7611	m514	GRADY	It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
L502819	u7611	m514	GRADY	Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
L502818	u7614	m514	JACK	She eh... interferes.
L502815	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, he is a very willful boy.
L502814	u7611	m514	GRADY	Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
L502813	u7614	m514	JACK	How?
L502812	u7611	m514	GRADY	A nigger cook.
L502811	u7614	m514	JACK	A nigger!
L502810	u7611	m514	GRADY	A nigger.
L502809	u7614	m514	JACK	Who?
L502808	u7611	m514	GRADY	He is, Mr. Torrance.
L502807	u7614	m514	JACK	No.
L502802	u7611	m514	GRADY	Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
L502801	u7614	m514	JACK	And, er... where are they now?
L502800	u7611	m514	GRADY	Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
L502798	u7611	m514	GRADY	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
L502797	u7614	m514	JACK	Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
L502796	u7611	m514	GRADY	Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
L502795	u7611	m514	GRADY	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
L502794	u7614	m514	JACK	haven't I seen you somewhere before?
L502792	u7611	m514	GRADY	That's right, sir.
L502791	u7614	m514	JACK	Delbert Grady.
L502790	u7611	m514	GRADY	Yes, sir.
L502789	u7614	m514	JACK	Grady?
L502786	u7614	m514	JACK	Fine.
L502785	u7611	m514	GRADY	Won't keep you a moment, sir.
L502778	u7614	m514	JACK	Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
L502777	u7611	m514	GRADY	That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
L502774	u7611	m514	GRADY	Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
L502773	u7614	m514	JACK	Advocaat is it?
L502772	u7611	m514	GRADY	I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
L502847	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
L502846	u7616	m514	RANGER	Good evening.  Forest Service.
L502748	u7616	m514	RANGER	All right, sir.
L502747	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
L502746	u7616	m514	RANGER	I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
L502741	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
L502740	u7616	m514	RANGER	Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
L502739	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
L502738	u7616	m514	RANGER	Good evening.  Forest Service.
L502453	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
L502452	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
L502411	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
L502410	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
L502401	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
L502400	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
L502395	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
L502394	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Sure.
L502393	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
L502461	u7619	m514	WENDY	Sound good to you, Danny?
L502460	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Good.
L502459	u7619	m514	WENDY	No, we don't mind.
L502436	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
L502435	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
L502434	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	I did?
L502433	u7619	m514	WENDY	Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
L502432	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Beg pardon?
L502423	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
L502422	u7619	m514	WENDY	I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
L502421	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
L502418	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
L502417	u7619	m514	WENDY	God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
L502416	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
L502415	u7619	m514	WENDY	I'm a Wendy.
L502414	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
L502399	u7619	m514	WENDY	Nice to meet you.
L502398	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Glad to meet you, Winifred.
L502210	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, I'm looking for a change.
L502209	u7618	m514	WATSON	Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
L502208	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
L502207	u7618	m514	WATSON	What line of work are you in now?
L502206	u7614	m514	JACK	Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
L502201	u7614	m514	JACK	Pleasure to meet you.
L502200	u7618	m514	WATSON	Pleased to meet you.
L502199	u7614	m514	JACK	Bill, how do you do?
L502766	u7615	m514	LLOYD	It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
L502765	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
L502761	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Your money's no good here.
L502760	u7614	m514	JACK	No charge?
L502755	u7615	m514	LLOYD	What'll it be, sir?
L502754	u7614	m514	JACK	It's good to be back, Lloyd.
L502753	u7615	m514	LLOYD	It's good to see you.
L502752	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Good evening Mr. Torrance.
L502751	u7614	m514	JACK	Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
L502686	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
L502685	u7614	m514	JACK	Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
L502682	u7615	m514	LLOYD	I hope it's nothing serious.
L502681	u7614	m514	JACK	Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
L502680	u7615	m514	LLOYD	How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
L502678	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Thank you for saying so.
L502677	u7614	m514	JACK	Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
L502676	u7614	m514	JACK	That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
L502675	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
L502674	u7614	m514	JACK	How's my credit in this joint anyway?
L502668	u7614	m514	JACK	Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
L502667	u7615	m514	LLOYD	What'll it be?
L502980	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy...
L502979	u7619	m514	WENDY	I'm gonna go now.
L502978	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy...
L502977	u7619	m514	WENDY	I'll bring back a doctor.
L502959	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502958	u7619	m514	WENDY	Go away.
L502957	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502956	u7619	m514	WENDY	Go away.
L502955	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy...
L502954	u7619	m514	WENDY	Go away from me.
L502953	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502952	u7619	m514	WENDY	Get down.
L502951	u7614	m514	JACK	Stop swinging the bat.
L502950	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack, stay away from me!
L502949	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502948	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me.
L502947	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502946	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay... stay away!
L502945	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy give me the bat.
L502944	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stop it!
L502943	u7614	m514	JACK	Put the bat down, Wendy.
L502942	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me.
L502941	u7614	m514	JACK	Stop swinging the bat.
L502940	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!  Please...
L502939	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!
L502938	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm not going to hurt you.
L502937	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!
L502935	u7614	m514	JACK	Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
L502934	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away...!
L502933	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy!
L502932	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me,
L502931	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm not going to hurt you.
L502930	u7619	m514	WENDY	Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
L502926	u7614	m514	JACK	Why?
L502925	u7619	m514	WENDY	I just want to go back to my room.
L502924	u7614	m514	JACK	Why?
L502923	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!
L502917	u7614	m514	JACK	Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
L502916	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
L502915	u7614	m514	JACK	Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
L502914	u7614	m514	JACK	Of course you are.
L502913	u7619	m514	WENDY	Of course I am.
L502906	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack...
L502905	u7614	m514	JACK	As soon as possible.
L502903	u7614	m514	JACK	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
L502902	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes...
L502901	u7614	m514	JACK	You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
L502900	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
L502899	u7614	m514	JACK	I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
L502898	u7619	m514	WENDY	I don't know.
L502892	u7614	m514	JACK	You can't remember.
L502891	u7619	m514	WENDY	I can't really remember.
L502890	u7619	m514	WENDY	I...
L502884	u7614	m514	JACK	How do you like it?
L502883	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack!
L502737	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
L502736	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack...
L502735	u7614	m514	JACK	Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
L502733	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502732	u7614	m514	JACK	You mean just leave the hotel?
L502731	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502730	u7614	m514	JACK	Get him out of here?
L502725	u7614	m514	JACK	I think he did it to himself.
L502724	u7619	m514	WENDY	Somebody did that to him.
L502718	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.
L502717	u7619	m514	WENDY	He's still asleep.
L502716	u7614	m514	JACK	Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
L502715	u7619	m514	WENDY	And you didn't see anything at all?
L502714	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes, I did.
L502713	u7619	m514	WENDY	You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
L502711	u7614	m514	JACK	No, nothing at all.
L502710	u7619	m514	WENDY	Did you find anything?
L502699	u7614	m514	JACK	Which room was it?
L502698	u7619	m514	WENDY	No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
L502648	u7614	m514	JACK	I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
L502647	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
L502646	u7614	m514	JACK	I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
L502563	u7614	m514	JACK	Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
L502562	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502561	u7614	m514	JACK	or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
L502560	u7614	m514	JACK	Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
L502559	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502558	u7614	m514	JACK	and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
L502556	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
L502555	u7619	m514	WENDY	Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
L502554	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
L502553	u7619	m514	WENDY	Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
L502552	u7614	m514	JACK	What do you want me to do about it?
L502524	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
L502523	u7614	m514	JACK	I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
L502522	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's really nice up here, isn't it?
L502521	u7614	m514	JACK	Yeah... that's all it is.
L502520	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
L502519	u7614	m514	JACK	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
L502518	u7619	m514	WENDY	Any ideas yet?
L502517	u7614	m514	JACK	Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
L502516	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
L502515	u7614	m514	JACK	Hmm, nice.
L502514	u7619	m514	WENDY	I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
L502513	u7614	m514	JACK	I know it.
L502512	u7619	m514	WENDY	I guess we've been staying up too late.
L502511	u7614	m514	JACK	Eleven thirty - Jesus!
L502510	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's about eleven thirty.
L502509	u7614	m514	JACK	What time is it?
L502508	u7619	m514	WENDY	Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
L502369	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.
L502368	u7614	m514	JACK	Perfect for a child.
L502355	u7619	m514	WENDY	God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
L502354	u7614	m514	JACK	Sure is.
L502320	u7614	m514	JACK	Uh...huh.
L502319	u7619	m514	WENDY	Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
L502253	u7614	m514	JACK	Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
L502252	u7619	m514	WENDY	Hi, hon.  How's it going?
L502251	u7614	m514	JACK	Hi, babe.
L502374	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, it's very... homely.
L502373	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
L502351	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh...
L502350	u7614	m514	JACK	I'd better collect my family first.
L502347	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
L502346	u7614	m514	JACK	Right there.
L502345	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
L502344	u7614	m514	JACK	No, my son's discovered the games room.
L502343	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
L502342	u7614	m514	JACK	No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
L502341	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
L502247	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
L502246	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
L502245	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, obviously some people can be
L502242	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, that is eh quite a story.
L502241	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	shut in together over long periods of time.
L502240	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
L502236	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, my predecessor in this job
L502235	u7614	m514	JACK	I don't believe they did.
L502234	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
L502233	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm intrigued.
L502232	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
L502230	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Great...
L502229	u7614	m514	JACK	They'll love it.
L502228	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
L502227	u7614	m514	JACK	Not for me.
L502226	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	can of itself be a problem.
L502225	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
L502224	u7614	m514	JACK	five months of peace is just what I want.
L502223	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
L502222	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
L502221	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, that sounds fine to me.
L502220	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
L502219	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well...
L502218	u7614	m514	JACK	Only in a very general way.
L502214	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh, it sure would be
L502213	u7614	m514	JACK	Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
L502212	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
L502178	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Susie.
L502177	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
L502176	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
L502175	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
L502174	u7614	m514	JACK	Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
L502173	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Have any trouble finding us?
L502169	u7614	m514	JACK	Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
L502168	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Very nice to meet you.
L502167	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh, well - come on in Jack.
L502166	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm Jack Torrance.
L502165	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes?
L502164	u7614	m514	JACK	Mr. Ullman?
L502471	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes.
L502470	u7619	m514	WENDY	Just like a ghost ship, huh?
L502469	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
L502468	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
L502467	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
L502450	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	How're you getting on?
L502449	u7619	m514	WENDY	Hi.
L502448	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Hi.
L502409	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Thank you, Susie.
L502408	u7619	m514	WENDY	Thanks.
L502388	u7619	m514	WENDY	Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
L502387	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
L502386	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh, I'll say.
L502385	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
L502384	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
L502383	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
L502363	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh!
L502362	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
L502361	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	All the best people.
L502360	u7619	m514	WENDY	Royalty?
L502359	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
L502357	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
L502356	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
L502353	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
L502352	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	This is our Colorado Lounge.
L502349	u7618	m514	WATSON	Fine.
L502348	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
L502338	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
L502337	u7618	m514	WATSON	Eight thirty.
L502336	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	What time does the plane leave?
L502205	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Jack is a schoolteacher.
L502204	u7618	m514	WATSON	Fine.
L502203	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
L502198	u7618	m514	WATSON	How do you do?
L502197	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
L506992	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
L506991	u7620	m515	JANE	The moon's not down yet...
L506981	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
L506980	u7620	m515	JANE	Sure, Uncle Al.
L506979	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Can I tell you kids something?
L506957	u7620	m515	JANE	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
L506956	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
L506940	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Jesus.
L506939	u7620	m515	JANE	Blue. This blue.
L506938	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Lowe's car-?
L506905	u7620	m515	JANE	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
L506904	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
L506903	u7620	m515	JANE	If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
L506888	u7620	m515	JANE	Uncle Al-
L506887	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
L507014	u7620	m515	JANE	You're a real booger, you know it?
L507013	u7621	m515	MARTY	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
L507012	u7620	m515	JANE	Are you all right, Marty?
L507001	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane-
L507000	u7620	m515	JANE	Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
L506964	u7620	m515	JANE	Will you?
L506963	u7621	m515	MARTY	Please, Uncle Al.
L506955	u7621	m515	MARTY	Will you marry me, Jane?
L506954	u7620	m515	JANE	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
L506953	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane... you don't have to do that.
L506859	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane, I have to talk to you.
L506858	u7620	m515	JANE	Went shopping. Why?
L506857	u7621	m515	MARTY	Where's Mom?
L506856	u7620	m515	JANE	Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
L506692	u7620	m515	JANE	Let me help you up.
L506691	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yes. Go away.
L506689	u7621	m515	MARTY	Stop it!
L506688	u7620	m515	JANE	What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
L506687	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
L506621	u7621	m515	MARTY	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
L506620	u7620	m515	JANE	I don't want your money. You're a booger.
L506619	u7621	m515	MARTY	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
L506618	u7620	m515	JANE	What's the money for?
L506616	u7620	m515	JANE	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
L506615	u7621	m515	MARTY	Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
L506611	u7620	m515	JANE	Brady's a booger and so are you!
L506610	u7621	m515	MARTY	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
L506609	u7620	m515	JANE	You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
L506663	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
L506662	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
L506661	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
L506657	u7623	m515	TAMMY	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
L506656	u7621	m515	MARTY	Rats...
L506655	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Rattling. Rustling.
L506654	u7621	m515	MARTY	What kind of noises?
L506653	u7623	m515	TAMMY	I've been hearing noises in there.
L506652	u7621	m515	MARTY	What?
L506651	u7623	m515	TAMMY	There's something else scary.
L506650	u7621	m515	MARTY	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
L506649	u7623	m515	TAMMY	I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
L506645	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... it is his third.
L506644	u7623	m515	TAMMY	For getting a divorce?
L506643	u7621	m515	MARTY	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
L506642	u7623	m515	TAMMY	What's that?
L506641	u7621	m515	MARTY	Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
L506639	u7621	m515	MARTY	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
L506638	u7623	m515	TAMMY	You booger.
L506994	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
L506993	u7621	m515	MARTY	What if I say no?
L506990	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
L506989	u7621	m515	MARTY	But Uncle Al! You said-
L506988	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
L506983	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
L506982	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah? Really?
L506962	u7621	m515	MARTY	Will you do it?
L506961	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
L506960	u7621	m515	MARTY	I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
L506959	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
L506958	u7621	m515	MARTY	No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
L506952	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
L506951	u7621	m515	MARTY	I saw what I saw.
L506950	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You're not going to let it go, are you?
L506949	u7621	m515	MARTY	I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
L506948	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
L506947	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
L506937	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	No.
L506936	u7621	m515	MARTY	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
L506935	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It could have been anything, Marty.
L506934	u7621	m515	MARTY	There! You see!
L506933	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
L506928	u7621	m515	MARTY	I told you!
L506927	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
L506926	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
L506925	u7621	m515	MARTY	I told you!
L506924	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
L506910	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
L506909	u7621	m515	MARTY	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
L506908	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
L506907	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, do you see your suspect?
L506906	u7621	m515	MARTY	I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
L506900	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
L506899	u7621	m515	MARTY	No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
L506898	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You want to know what I think?
L506897	u7621	m515	MARTY	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
L506896	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
L506895	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... was it a prescription?
L506894	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
L506893	u7621	m515	MARTY	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
L506892	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	What the hell does that matter?
L506891	u7621	m515	MARTY	Was it a prescription?
L506890	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
L506889	u7621	m515	MARTY	It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
L506850	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
L506849	u7621	m515	MARTY	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
L506848	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	A tracer. You'll like it.
L506847	u7621	m515	MARTY	What is it?
L506846	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Save this one for last.
L506845	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah... sure.
L506844	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
L506843	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah, I know. It's great!
L506842	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
L506840	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah! What is it?
L506839	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
L506834	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Good.
L506833	u7621	m515	MARTY	Sure.
L506832	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
L506831	u7621	m515	MARTY	I don't get you.
L506830	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
L506829	u7621	m515	MARTY	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
L506828	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
L506827	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
L506826	u7621	m515	MARTY	Do I need one?
L506825	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You got a pilot's license, Marty?
L506822	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
L506821	u7621	m515	MARTY	What?
L506820	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
L506818	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
L506817	u7621	m515	MARTY	She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
L506816	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Your mom's not around, is she?
L506814	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
L506813	u7621	m515	MARTY	Don't call me dear boy.
L506812	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
L506811	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
L506810	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
L506809	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
L506808	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
L506807	u7621	m515	MARTY	It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
L506739	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
L506738	u7621	m515	MARTY	What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
L506737	u7621	m515	MARTY	What if it's some kind of monster?
L506736	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Huh?
L506735	u7621	m515	MARTY	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
L506734	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
L506733	u7621	m515	MARTY	No.
L506732	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
L506731	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah.
L506730	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You all right, Marty?
L506680	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
L506679	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mom-!
L506677	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
L506676	u7621	m515	MARTY	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
L506675	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
L506977	u7622	m515	NAN	I will- be good, kids.
L506976	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
L506975	u7622	m515	NAN	You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
L506974	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	We won't!
L506973	u7622	m515	NAN	And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
L506972	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
L506971	u7622	m515	NAN	Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
L506837	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
L506836	u7622	m515	NAN	So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
L506686	u7622	m515	NAN	Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
L506685	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I come here because Marty needs a friend.
L526896	u7805	m528	BARNES	Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
L526895	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Open it, Captain!
L526894	u7805	m528	BARNES	... Your civil rights have been overridden!
L526892	u7805	m528	BARNES	Please, Dr. Levine.
L526891	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
L526890	u7805	m528	BARNES	Calm down, Dr. Levine.
L526889	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
L527286	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	I can't...
L527285	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher!  Now!
L527284	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	I can't see...
L527283	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get out of there!
L527282	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	It's burning...
L527281	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher, get away from there...
L527277	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher, I want you back here.
L527276	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
L527273	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
L527272	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
L527585	u7805	m528	BARNES	Pull it, damn it!
L527584	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman, please!  Don't!
L527583	u7805	m528	BARNES	Now!
L527582	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't do it!
L527580	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman, don't do it!
L527579	u7805	m528	BARNES	Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
L527578	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
L527575	u7805	m528	BARNES	Do you see it?
L527574	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't do it, Norman!
L527564	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's either that or we grow gills.
L527563	u7806	m528	BETH	That's our reserve air.
L527562	u7805	m528	BARNES	Increase positive pressure!
L527559	u7805	m528	BARNES	He's right beneath us.
L527558	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?
L527557	u7805	m528	BARNES	Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
L527556	u7806	m528	BETH	Where is it?
L527552	u7806	m528	BETH	What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
L527551	u7805	m528	BARNES	Thirty yards.
L527550	u7805	m528	BARNES	Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
L527549	u7806	m528	BETH	But you've tested it?
L527548	u7805	m528	BARNES	Forty yards.
L527547	u7805	m528	BARNES	It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
L527546	u7806	m528	BETH	High Voltage?
L527545	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
L527544	u7806	m528	BETH	What do we use for defense?
L527543	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fifty yards and closing.
L527542	u7806	m528	BETH	What if it attacks?
L527541	u7805	m528	BARNES	A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
L527537	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?
L527536	u7805	m528	BARNES	Direction's east coming!
L527530	u7805	m528	BARNES	Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
L527529	u7806	m528	BETH	Nice work, Captain sir.
L527491	u7805	m528	BARNES	You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
L527490	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
L527289	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody move!
L527288	u7806	m528	BETH	But she's --
L527287	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody move.
L527249	u7806	m528	BETH	Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
L527248	u7805	m528	BARNES	There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
L527247	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah.  I heard you.
L527246	u7805	m528	BARNES	Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
L527224	u7806	m528	BETH	Two and a half days?
L527223	u7805	m528	BARNES	They told me about sixty hours.
L527222	u7806	m528	BETH	How long will that be?
L527221	u7805	m528	BARNES	The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
L527198	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
L527197	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman!
L527191	u7805	m528	BARNES	What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
L527190	u7806	m528	BETH	I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
L527110	u7805	m528	BARNES	Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
L527109	u7806	m528	BETH	Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
L527007	u7806	m528	BETH	How about I just press the button?
L527006	u7805	m528	BARNES	Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
L526999	u7806	m528	BETH	Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
L526998	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it?
L526997	u7806	m528	BETH	Hold on --
L526988	u7806	m528	BETH	Would you wait a minute?
L526987	u7805	m528	BARNES	I said back away.
L526986	u7806	m528	BETH	Wait a minute --
L526985	u7805	m528	BARNES	Back away then.
L526984	u7806	m528	BETH	There's heat coming the door.
L526854	u7805	m528	BARNES	Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
L526853	u7806	m528	BETH	In basic English, what does all this mean?
L526845	u7805	m528	BARNES	Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
L526844	u7806	m528	BETH	How big is this spacecraft?
L527577	u7805	m528	BARNES	Pull it.
L527576	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I see it.
L527571	u7805	m528	BARNES	You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
L527570	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes, sir.  I'm here.
L527555	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
L527554	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
L527553	u7805	m528	BARNES	What the hell?  It shut us down.
L527539	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Jerry?
L527538	u7805	m528	BARNES	Going active.
L527527	u7805	m528	BARNES	No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
L527526	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
L527525	u7805	m528	BARNES	Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
L527524	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
L527523	u7805	m528	BARNES	You think he killed Edmunds?
L527520	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
L527519	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't want you talking to Jerry.
L527488	u7811	m528	NORMAN	At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
L527487	u7805	m528	BARNES	If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
L527486	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What for?
L527454	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?  Can you copy?
L527453	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
L527452	u7805	m528	BARNES	Damn it, Edmunds?
L527451	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
L527450	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?
L527422	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
L527421	u7805	m528	BARNES	You don't think weapons are important?
L527420	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
L527419	u7805	m528	BARNES	Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
L527379	u7805	m528	BARNES	What am I -- a dog, now?
L527378	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
L527377	u7805	m528	BARNES	"He translated it wrong.  ""My name is Jerry""?  It's like ""See Spot run."""
L527338	u7805	m528	BARNES	"-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, ""When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."""
L527337	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- I didn't know it would come to this --
L527336	u7805	m528	BARNES	-- and then brought her down here --
L527335	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a second --
L527334	u7805	m528	BARNES	You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
L527333	u7811	m528	NORMAN	At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
L527332	u7805	m528	BARNES	So you knew this when you wrote your report?
L527331	u7811	m528	NORMAN	'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
L527330	u7805	m528	BARNES	When was this?
L527329	u7811	m528	NORMAN	She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
L527328	u7805	m528	BARNES	She should've known better.
L527327	u7811	m528	NORMAN	A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
L527326	u7805	m528	BARNES	I think I do.
L527325	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You don't want to know.
L527324	u7805	m528	BARNES	How drastic?
L527323	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
L527182	u7805	m528	BARNES	"No ""buts"".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit."
L527181	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir --
L527180	u7805	m528	BARNES	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
L527179	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
L527161	u7805	m528	BARNES	He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
L527160	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
L527159	u7805	m528	BARNES	What do you mean, he's missing?
L527158	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry's missing.
L527152	u7805	m528	BARNES	Just worry about yourself.
L527151	u7811	m528	NORMAN	All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
L527150	u7805	m528	BARNES	Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
L527149	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
L527148	u7805	m528	BARNES	Don't get hysterical, Norman.
L527108	u7805	m528	BARNES	Everything can be killed.
L527107	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.  That's the point.
L527106	u7805	m528	BARNES	You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
L527105	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
L527104	u7805	m528	BARNES	"Like ""Thou shall not kill""?"
L527095	u7811	m528	NORMAN	If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
L527094	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527093	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Maybe we shouldn't.
L527076	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't know.  But it's something alien.
L527075	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Picked up something?  What is it?
L526977	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Take a look.
L526976	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it, Norman?
L526921	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
L526920	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What's wrong with oxygen?
L526919	u7805	m528	BARNES	They pressurize us with helium.
L526843	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
L526842	u7805	m528	BARNES	Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
L526841	u7811	m528	NORMAN	ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
L526840	u7805	m528	BARNES	The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
L526839	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What team?
L526838	u7805	m528	BARNES	We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
L526837	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It doesn't make any sense.
L526836	u7805	m528	BARNES	Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
L526835	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
L526834	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's impossible.
L526833	u7805	m528	BARNES	Extraordinary, isn't it?
L526832	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
L526831	u7805	m528	BARNES	Maybe older --
L526830	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on --
L526829	u7805	m528	BARNES	-- dating the crash at least that old.
L526828	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- Wait a second --
L526827	u7805	m528	BARNES	Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
L526826	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Geologists?
L526825	u7805	m528	BARNES	See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
L526823	u7805	m528	BARNES	As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
L526822	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
L526821	u7805	m528	BARNES	Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
L526820	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
L526817	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you need me for?
L526816	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L526815	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then why am I here?
L526814	u7805	m528	BARNES	Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
L526813	u7811	m528	NORMAN	A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
L526812	u7805	m528	BARNES	A thousand feet.
L526811	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How deep is he?
L526809	u7811	m528	NORMAN	They didn't tell me anything.
L526808	u7805	m528	BARNES	A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
L526807	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Storm?  What storm?
L526806	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're moving fast considering the storm.
L526805	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
L526804	u7811	m528	NORMAN	From what?  What's with all the security?
L526803	u7805	m528	BARNES	Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
L526802	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Press?  No, I haven't.
L526801	u7805	m528	BARNES	You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
L526798	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Nothing else.
L526797	u7805	m528	BARNES	Anything else?
L526796	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
L526795	u7805	m528	BARNES	What have you been told so far?
L526794	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What team?
L526793	u7805	m528	BARNES	Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
L526792	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
L526791	u7805	m528	BARNES	Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
L526790	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
L526789	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Captain.  Right, forgive me.
L526788	u7805	m528	BARNES	Captain.
L526787	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thank you, Colonel.
L527381	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	In a minute, sir.
L527380	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
L527212	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
L527211	u7805	m528	BARNES	Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
L527207	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
L527206	u7805	m528	BARNES	They've left, keep watching!
L527205	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
L527201	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	In the ship, sir.
L527200	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, where the fuck is he?
L527199	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Yes, sir.
L527193	u7805	m528	BARNES	What the hell is going on here?
L527192	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing, sir.
L527187	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
L527186	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing, sir.
L527185	u7805	m528	BARNES	Any sign of Harry?
L527184	u7805	m528	BARNES	They're coming.
L527183	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
L527178	u7805	m528	BARNES	Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
L527177	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Subs are still at surface, sir.
L527173	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Harry?  Can you copy?
L527172	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
L527143	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
L527142	u7805	m528	BARNES	What caused it?
L526936	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
L526935	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
L526934	u7805	m528	BARNES	Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
L526933	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	It's not sucking, sir.
L526929	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Working on it now, sir.
L526928	u7805	m528	BARNES	Can you open that panel?
L527443	u7809	m528	HARRY	If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
L527442	u7805	m528	BARNES	She wired this system.
L527441	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's not gonna know.
L527440	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
L527416	u7809	m528	HARRY	What -- you want me to retype it?
L527415	u7805	m528	BARNES	"With an ""o"".  Harold with an ""o""."
L527414	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm in charge.
L527413	u7809	m528	HARRY	"He's saying, ""Take me to your leader."" He wants to know who's in charge."
L527412	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527408	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's not gonna know, sir.
L527407	u7805	m528	BARNES	Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
L527400	u7809	m528	HARRY	He understands me fine.
L527399	u7805	m528	BARNES	Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
L527397	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's not ignorant.
L527396	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
L527375	u7805	m528	BARNES	How do you mean, strange?
L527374	u7809	m528	HARRY	I have to tell you.  It's strange.
L527373	u7805	m528	BARNES	What's the message?
L527372	u7809	m528	HARRY	"... spiralling out of the center, you see: ""G"" is one, ""B"" is two, ""H"" is three, and so on... when I got the message."
L527341	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
L527340	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
L527169	u7809	m528	HARRY	Please watch your closest monitor...
L527168	u7805	m528	BARNES	Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
L527167	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ladies and Gentlemen...
L527166	u7805	m528	BARNES	Gimme a report, I want --
L527117	u7805	m528	BARNES	Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
L527116	u7809	m528	HARRY	Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
L527115	u7805	m528	BARNES	You don't know that.
L527114	u7809	m528	HARRY	It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
L527113	u7805	m528	BARNES	Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
L527101	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
L527100	u7805	m528	BARNES	So?  What's the problem?
L527097	u7805	m528	BARNES	The what?
L527096	u7809	m528	HARRY	Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
L527092	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ted seems to have some ideas.
L527091	u7805	m528	BARNES	So how do we get it open?
L527089	u7805	m528	BARNES	A break for what?
L527088	u7809	m528	HARRY	To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
L527087	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527086	u7809	m528	HARRY	No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
L527074	u7805	m528	BARNES	So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
L527073	u7809	m528	HARRY	We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
L527072	u7805	m528	BARNES	Yes, Harry.
L527071	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ted?  Captain?
L526983	u7809	m528	HARRY	Then how can it be chipped?
L526982	u7805	m528	BARNES	I did.
L526981	u7809	m528	HARRY	I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
L526980	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
L526979	u7809	m528	HARRY	Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
L526978	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's chipped.
L526851	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
L526850	u7809	m528	HARRY	Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
L526849	u7805	m528	BARNES	To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
L526848	u7809	m528	HARRY	How much damage?
L527485	u7805	m528	BARNES	"In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the ""delay"" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes."
L527484	u7814	m528	TED	What sub?
L527483	u7805	m528	BARNES	Resetting the sub.
L527482	u7814	m528	TED	What was Edmunds doing outside?
L527481	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
L527467	u7814	m528	TED	Too big?
L527466	u7805	m528	BARNES	It won't register.  It's too big to image.
L527465	u7814	m528	TED	What?
L527464	u7805	m528	BARNES	The sensors are picking up something outside.
L527463	u7814	m528	TED	What is that?
L527447	u7814	m528	TED	Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
L527446	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?
L527392	u7814	m528	TED	Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
L527391	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's not talking, it's mimicking.
L527384	u7805	m528	BARNES	I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
L527383	u7814	m528	TED	Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
L527382	u7805	m528	BARNES	I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
L527349	u7814	m528	TED	What's inside the sphere.
L527348	u7805	m528	BARNES	From the sphere?
L527275	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
L527274	u7814	m528	TED	She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
L527219	u7805	m528	BARNES	Internal power.
L527218	u7814	m528	TED	To what?
L527217	u7805	m528	BARNES	They switched us over.
L527164	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
L527163	u7814	m528	TED	Sir, about leaving --
L527162	u7805	m528	BARNES	How can he be missing?
L527157	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
L527156	u7814	m528	TED	Did you hear me, sir, because --
L527154	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?  No, I know they're civilians...
L527153	u7814	m528	TED	Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
L527083	u7814	m528	TED	Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
L527082	u7805	m528	BARNES	But what does it do?  This... sphere.
L527052	u7814	m528	TED	Maybe we didn't want to come back.
L527051	u7805	m528	BARNES	What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
L527050	u7814	m528	TED	Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
L527041	u7814	m528	TED	Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
L527040	u7805	m528	BARNES	We had considered it.
L527013	u7805	m528	BARNES	What do you make of this?
L527012	u7814	m528	TED	What's wrong?
L526996	u7814	m528	TED	A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
L526995	u7805	m528	BARNES	Radiation shield, you think?
L526994	u7814	m528	TED	Some sort of lead or something.
L526993	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it?
L526992	u7814	m528	TED	Look at this.
L526990	u7814	m528	TED	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
L526989	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, get her away from the door.
L526939	u7814	m528	TED	What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
L526938	u7805	m528	BARNES	What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
L526932	u7805	m528	BARNES	Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
L526931	u7814	m528	TED	I'd also like it noted --
L526927	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
L526926	u7814	m528	TED	Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
L526847	u7805	m528	BARNES	The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
L526846	u7814	m528	TED	A half a mile long?
L528072	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
L528071	u7806	m528	BETH	How's that?
L528070	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
L528069	u7806	m528	BETH	Would it work?
L527993	u7806	m528	BETH	Get away --
L527992	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527991	u7806	m528	BETH	Get away from me!
L527990	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hear what?
L527989	u7806	m528	BETH	You hear that?
L527988	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L527987	u7806	m528	BETH	What is that?  What are you doing?
L527983	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
L527982	u7806	m528	BETH	Top shelf, is it?
L527981	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon --
L527980	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
L527979	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth -- gimme the gun.
L527978	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
L527977	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I --
L527976	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
L527975	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
L527974	u7806	m528	BETH	You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
L527972	u7806	m528	BETH	Leave me alone, Norman.
L527971	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth?
L527957	u7806	m528	BETH	It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
L527956	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Stop it!
L527954	u7806	m528	BETH	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
L527953	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then where's it coming from?
L527952	u7806	m528	BETH	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
L527951	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, stop it!
L527950	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't you know?
L527949	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where is it coming from, Beth?
L527948	u7806	m528	BETH	You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
L527947	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth!
L527945	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
L527944	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't fuck with me, Beth.
L527943	u7806	m528	BETH	Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
L527938	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get away from the door, Beth.
L527937	u7806	m528	BETH	This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
L527932	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
L527931	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not safe for you to be either.
L527930	u7806	m528	BETH	It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
L527928	u7806	m528	BETH	It's either this... or I kill you.
L527927	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't, Beth.  Please.
L527926	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
L527925	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527924	u7806	m528	BETH	Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
L527923	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I promise --
L527922	u7806	m528	BETH	But I have to, Norman.
L527921	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't, Beth.
L527920	u7806	m528	BETH	It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything. Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
L527919	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
L527918	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
L527917	u7806	m528	BETH	"When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  ""I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water."" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?"
L527916	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up, Beth --
L527915	u7806	m528	BETH	"No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  ""Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming."" ""But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared."" ""C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun.""  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?"
L527914	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Beth, the message said Harry.  ""My name is Harry"".  My name isn't Harry."
L527913	u7806	m528	BETH	Is it?
L527912	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's bullshit.
L527911	u7806	m528	BETH	"You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  ""Like everything's on the tip of my tongue"", he said."
L527910	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes.
L527909	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
L527908	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I never went in that sphere.
L527907	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
L527906	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're insane.
L527905	u7806	m528	BETH	Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
L527904	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You manifested that, Beth.
L527903	u7806	m528	BETH	One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
L527902	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's when you went in the sphere.
L527901	u7806	m528	BETH	And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
L527900	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But --
L527899	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
L527898	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're lying --
L527897	u7806	m528	BETH	C'mon -- what?
L527896	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
L527895	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
L527894	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Someone did.
L527893	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I manifested the snakes?
L527892	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
L527891	u7806	m528	BETH	No, he can't.
L527890	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He can't manifest.
L527889	u7806	m528	BETH	No, he isn't.
L527888	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
L527887	u7806	m528	BETH	Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
L527886	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
L527885	u7806	m528	BETH	"What's the phrase -- ""keeping up with the Joneses""?"
L527884	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Did you?
L527883	u7806	m528	BETH	If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
L527882	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Are you manifesting them?
L527881	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't you?
L527880	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Do you fear them?
L527879	u7806	m528	BETH	You tell me.
L527878	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
L527877	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
L527876	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You know what I mean.
L527875	u7806	m528	BETH	Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
L527874	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How do you feel about snakes?
L527873	u7806	m528	BETH	I did do that, didn't I?
L527872	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
L527871	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't think I put something in it, do you?
L527870	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You think I'd really drink that?
L527869	u7806	m528	BETH	It's getting cold.
L527868	u7806	m528	BETH	Are you?
L527867	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm feeling better.
L527866	u7806	m528	BETH	What's wrong, Norman?
L527862	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
L527861	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Your watch.
L527860	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
L527840	u7806	m528	BETH	How's Harry?
L527839	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
L527838	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you mean, different?
L527837	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The sphere looks different.
L527836	u7806	m528	BETH	In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
L527835	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where are you?
L527834	u7806	m528	BETH	What is it, Norman?
L527829	u7806	m528	BETH	You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
L527828	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not believing you.
L527827	u7806	m528	BETH	For what?
L527826	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm sorry.
L527815	u7806	m528	BETH	Only lab rats.  Here.
L527814	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
L527813	u7806	m528	BETH	You ever given an injection before.
L527812	u7806	m528	BETH	Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
L527811	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You want to kill him?
L527810	u7806	m528	BETH	To be on the safe side.  I mean --
L527809	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527808	u7806	m528	BETH	It's an idea.
L527806	u7806	m528	BETH	What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
L527805	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Doesn't say.
L527804	u7806	m528	BETH	How fast does it take effect?
L527803	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
L527802	u7806	m528	BETH	I'll just boost the doses.
L527801	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Three to six hours.
L527800	u7806	m528	BETH	How long does it last?
L527799	u7811	m528	NORMAN	20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... 
L527797	u7806	m528	BETH	... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... 
L527796	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's like a sleeping pill?
L527795	u7806	m528	BETH	Causes sleep.
L527794	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What's that?
L527793	u7806	m528	BETH	It's a soporific.
L527792	u7811	m528	NORMAN	P-a-r-a-s-o...
L527791	u7806	m528	BETH	How do you spell it?
L527790	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Parasolutrine?
L527789	u7806	m528	BETH	Antibiotic.
L527788	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
L527787	u7806	m528	BETH	Antihistamine.  For bites.
L527786	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Riordan?
L527785	u7806	m528	BETH	... and may also cause bizarre halucinations.
L527784	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Bingo.
L527783	u7806	m528	BETH	Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
L527782	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Tarazine?
L527781	u7806	m528	BETH	Nothing about drowsiness.
L527780	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
L527779	u7806	m528	BETH	A synthetic opium analogue.
L527778	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Sintag.
L527777	u7806	m528	BETH	Ulcers.
L527776	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Valdomet.
L527775	u7806	m528	BETH	It's for motion sickness.
L527774	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Ephedrine hydrochloride.
L527773	u7806	m528	BETH	Something for burns.
L527772	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Diphenyl parlene.
L527744	u7806	m528	BETH	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
L527743	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Looks like some sort of code.
L527742	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
L527741	u7806	m528	BETH	And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
L527740	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
L527739	u7806	m528	BETH	His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
L527738	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
L527737	u7806	m528	BETH	But why is he doing it?
L527736	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
L527735	u7806	m528	BETH	Which I told Barnes was attacking --
L527734	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
L527733	u7806	m528	BETH	How can the sphere do that?
L527732	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.
L527731	u7806	m528	BETH	But how?
L527730	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
L527729	u7806	m528	BETH	You think, in the sphere --
L527728	u7811	m528	NORMAN	When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
L527727	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you mean, a part of Harry?
L527726	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say ""Harry"", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry."
L527724	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527723	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He translated it wrong.
L527722	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, ""Stop calling me Jerry"".  And --"
L527721	u7806	m528	BETH	Manifested?
L527720	u7811	m528	NORMAN	After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
L527717	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster.
L527716	u7806	m528	BETH	Squids?
L527715	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
L527714	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87.  I could never read that far."""
L527713	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527712	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87.
L527709	u7806	m528	BETH	Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
L527708	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
L527707	u7806	m528	BETH	You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
L527706	u7811	m528	NORMAN	This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
L527705	u7806	m528	BETH	Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
L527704	u7811	m528	NORMAN	All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
L527703	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't believe me.
L527702	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You think?
L527701	u7806	m528	BETH	No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
L527700	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
L527699	u7806	m528	BETH	None of this was here before.
L527698	u7811	m528	NORMAN	1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
L527697	u7806	m528	BETH	Wait a second --
L527696	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We must've had it delivered then.
L527695	u7806	m528	BETH	That wasn't in there before.
L527694	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
L527693	u7806	m528	BETH	The refridgerator.
L527692	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The refridgerator.
L527691	u7806	m528	BETH	Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
L527690	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Fixing it.
L527689	u7806	m528	BETH	What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
L527688	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I think so, Beth.  Yes.
L527687	u7806	m528	BETH	You get it straightened out?
L527676	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He what?
L527675	u7806	m528	BETH	Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
L527674	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
L527673	u7806	m528	BETH	Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
L527672	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
L527671	u7806	m528	BETH	... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
L527649	u7806	m528	BETH	Still clear.
L527648	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Still clear?
L527647	u7806	m528	BETH	You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
L527646	u7811	m528	NORMAN	My air isn't... I'm coming back.
L527645	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
L527644	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You fixed this suit?  Beth?
L527643	u7806	m528	BETH	What's the matter?
L527642	u7806	m528	BETH	Still clear.
L527641	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
L527640	u7806	m528	BETH	The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
L527637	u7806	m528	BETH	You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
L527636	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But I don't know how --
L527635	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't trust me?
L527634	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You fixed my suit?
L527633	u7806	m528	BETH	I fixed your suit.
L527632	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I would.  But my suit --
L527631	u7806	m528	BETH	I don't trust Harry to do it.
L527630	u7811	m528	NORMAN	In case you die, too?
L527629	u7806	m528	BETH	You should know how it works.  Just in case.
L527628	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Why should I go?
L527627	u7806	m528	BETH	Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
L527626	u7806	m528	BETH	Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
L527625	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Four days?
L527624	u7806	m528	BETH	We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
L527623	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
L527622	u7806	m528	BETH	You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
L527621	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You, me and Harry?
L527620	u7806	m528	BETH	It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
L527619	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not worth the risk.
L527618	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't bother me, Norman.
L527617	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Forget the sub.
L527616	u7806	m528	BETH	I have to reset the sub.
L527615	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where are you going in such a hurry?
L527517	u7806	m528	BETH	No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
L527516	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527515	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
L527514	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
L527513	u7806	m528	BETH	You bastard.
L527512	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't do this.
L527511	u7806	m528	BETH	You did, didn't you?
L527510	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527509	u7806	m528	BETH	You told him about me?
L527508	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L527507	u7806	m528	BETH	You said something to him, didn't you?
L527506	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
L527505	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't tell me to calm down!
L527504	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
L527503	u7806	m528	BETH	He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
L527502	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You went through Edmunds' things?
L527501	u7806	m528	BETH	In Edmunds' things.
L527500	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where did you get this?
L527499	u7806	m528	BETH	Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN.
L527498	u7806	m528	BETH	Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
L527497	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
L527496	u7806	m528	BETH	So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
L527495	u7811	m528	NORMAN	So what?
L527494	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
L527493	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
L527492	u7806	m528	BETH	... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
L527470	u7806	m528	BETH	Eggs.
L527469	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are they?
L527468	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman.
L527462	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What could have done this?
L527461	u7806	m528	BETH	She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
L527460	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
L527320	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth.
L527319	u7806	m528	BETH	I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
L527318	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527317	u7806	m528	BETH	Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
L527316	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth.
L527315	u7806	m528	BETH	What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
L527314	u7811	m528	NORMAN	They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
L527313	u7806	m528	BETH	I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
L527312	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527311	u7806	m528	BETH	What?  Why...
L527310	u7811	m528	NORMAN	And you didn't tell anyone?
L527309	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, why?
L527308	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
L527307	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527306	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a minute.
L527305	u7806	m528	BETH	They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
L527304	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you mean -- not normal?
L527303	u7806	m528	BETH	Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
L527302	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
L527301	u7806	m528	BETH	What about you?  What happened to you?
L527300	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah, it was awful.
L527299	u7806	m528	BETH	My gosh, Norman.
L527298	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
L527297	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
L527296	u7806	m528	BETH	A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
L527295	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We have a library?
L527294	u7806	m528	BETH	The library.
L527293	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where'd this come from?
L527119	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
L527118	u7806	m528	BETH	It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
L527058	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get this thing off me.
L527057	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman!
L527028	u7806	m528	BETH	Good theory, Ted.
L527027	u7811	m528	NORMAN	400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
L526957	u7806	m528	BETH	Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
L526956	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
L526955	u7806	m528	BETH	You're next, Norman.
L526954	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah.  Drowning.
L526953	u7806	m528	BETH	Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
L526876	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What -- are you threatening me?
L526875	u7806	m528	BETH	Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
L526874	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The timing has never seemed quite right.
L526873	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
L526872	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It never occurred to me.
L526871	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
L526870	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
L526869	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
L526868	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Underwater?
L526867	u7806	m528	BETH	To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
L526866	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait -- down where?
L526865	u7806	m528	BETH	Because when we get down there --
L526864	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
L526863	u7806	m528	BETH	Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
L526862	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
L526861	u7806	m528	BETH	That's quite a secret.
L526860	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
L526859	u7806	m528	BETH	I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
L526858	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
L526857	u7806	m528	BETH	I love secrets.
L526856	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
L527406	u7806	m528	BETH	Who says it's a he?
L527405	u7814	m528	TED	He doesn't wait for an answer.
L527195	u7814	m528	TED	By the bunks.
L527194	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman?  Where's Norman?
L527030	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
L527029	u7814	m528	TED	Well, what's your theory?
L527018	u7814	m528	TED	It doesn't make any sense.
L527017	u7806	m528	BETH	I don't get it.
L527002	u7814	m528	TED	Well, they're not mine.
L527001	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
L527000	u7814	m528	TED	No.  I don't think so.
L526900	u7806	m528	BETH	What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
L526899	u7814	m528	TED	Pussy.
L528063	u7809	m528	HARRY	Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
L528062	u7806	m528	BETH	We can refuse to talk.
L528061	u7809	m528	HARRY	They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
L527766	u7809	m528	HARRY	Yes you are...
L527765	u7806	m528	BETH	No I'm not.  I'm not star--
L527764	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're staring at me.
L527763	u7806	m528	BETH	Like what?  I'm not --
L527762	u7809	m528	HARRY	Why are you looking at me like that?
L527761	u7809	m528	HARRY	Another attack?
L527760	u7806	m528	BETH	Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
L527759	u7809	m528	HARRY	Just in time for what?
L527758	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527757	u7809	m528	HARRY	In time for what?
L527756	u7806	m528	BETH	Just in time, too.
L527749	u7809	m528	HARRY	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
L527748	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
L527747	u7809	m528	HARRY	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
L527746	u7806	m528	BETH	Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
L527681	u7806	m528	BETH	Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
L527680	u7809	m528	HARRY	We never even had a conversation, Norman.
L527679	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
L527678	u7809	m528	HARRY	I never said that.
L527677	u7806	m528	BETH	When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
L527103	u7809	m528	HARRY	Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
L527102	u7806	m528	BETH	Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
L527054	u7809	m528	HARRY	A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
L527053	u7806	m528	BETH	What are you looking for?
L527037	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's an American spacecraft.
L527036	u7806	m528	BETH	Then what is it?
L527005	u7809	m528	HARRY	You'd have to ask them.
L527004	u7806	m528	BETH	It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
L526943	u7806	m528	BETH	For whoever's in that thing.
L526942	u7809	m528	HARRY	For who?  The fish?
L526941	u7806	m528	BETH	All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
L526940	u7809	m528	HARRY	Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
L527263	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
L527262	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Is it coming from our own computer?
L527261	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
L527260	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where's it coming from?
L527259	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
L527258	u7811	m528	NORMAN	When did it come across?
L528068	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
L528067	u7809	m528	HARRY	You mean forget?
L528066	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
L528065	u7809	m528	HARRY	We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
L528064	u7811	m528	NORMAN	There is one possibility.
L528055	u7809	m528	HARRY	No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
L528054	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
L528053	u7809	m528	HARRY	How's that working out, by the way?
L528049	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
L528048	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Nine hundred feet to surface.
L528047	u7809	m528	HARRY	Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
L528043	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait!
L528042	u7809	m528	HARRY	Well, press something!
L528041	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No idea.
L528040	u7809	m528	HARRY	You know how to work this thing?
L528038	u7809	m528	HARRY	I'm trying.  There.
L528037	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
L528036	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You got her?
L528035	u7809	m528	HARRY	Her legs are in the way.
L528034	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
L528033	u7809	m528	HARRY	Gimme a second --
L528032	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm trying to keep balance with --
L528031	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon, Norman!
L528024	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up and catch.
L528023	u7809	m528	HARRY	Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
L528022	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I heard!  I heard!
L528021	u7809	m528	HARRY	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
L528020	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on.
L528018	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
L528017	u7809	m528	HARRY	Missed.
L528016	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
L528015	u7809	m528	HARRY	Push her, c'mon.
L528014	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on.
L528013	u7809	m528	HARRY	I can't reach her.
L528007	u7809	m528	HARRY	How far away's the sub?
L528006	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
L528005	u7809	m528	HARRY	How much time you figure to get to the surface?
L528004	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up and open the door.
L528003	u7809	m528	HARRY	We're never gonna make it.
L528002	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Help me lift her.
L528001	u7809	m528	HARRY	Fine.
L527996	u7809	m528	HARRY	I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
L527995	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't think so.
L527994	u7809	m528	HARRY	Did I kill her?
L527823	u7809	m528	HARRY	Stop what?  What are you -- ?
L527822	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's the squid!  Stop it!
L527821	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You know what it is, Harry.
L527820	u7809	m528	HARRY	What is it?
L527771	u7809	m528	HARRY	Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
L527770	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's right.
L527769	u7809	m528	HARRY	The three of us.
L527768	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
L527754	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
L527753	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How do we decode it?
L527752	u7809	m528	HARRY	Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
L527751	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wisconsin?
L527750	u7809	m528	HARRY	Wisconsin's your answer.
L527686	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
L527685	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But why would she -- ?
L527684	u7809	m528	HARRY	I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
L527683	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You didn't say that about the food?
L527682	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's cracking, Norman.
L527670	u7809	m528	HARRY	I thought she was with you.
L527669	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth left?
L527668	u7809	m528	HARRY	Her suit's gone.
L527667	u7811	m528	NORMAN	She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
L527666	u7809	m528	HARRY	When I woke up, nobody was here.
L527665	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you mean?  She's not here?
L527664	u7809	m528	HARRY	What happened to her?
L527663	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
L527661	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're clear.  You see the airlock?
L527660	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
L527659	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman, where are you?
L527658	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry?
L527657	u7809	m528	HARRY	... you there?  Norman?
L527271	u7809	m528	HARRY	I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
L527270	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You don't remember that?
L527269	u7809	m528	HARRY	Did I?
L527268	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
L527267	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
L527266	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
L527265	u7809	m528	HARRY	There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
L527264	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Getting anywhere with those?
L527255	u7809	m528	HARRY	What are they?
L527254	u7811	m528	NORMAN	These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
L527243	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That far in what, Harry?
L527242	u7809	m528	HARRY	I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
L527241	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87 of what, Harry?
L527240	u7809	m528	HARRY	What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
L527239	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What is it, Harry?
L527238	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman?
L527237	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then explain it to me.
L527236	u7809	m528	HARRY	You don't understand about the sphere.
L527235	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
L527234	u7809	m528	HARRY	You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
L527233	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You remember opening the door?
L527232	u7809	m528	HARRY	What are you still doing here?
L527231	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
L527230	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's like...
L527229	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What noise?
L527228	u7809	m528	HARRY	What is that?  That noise?
L527141	u7809	m528	HARRY	Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
L527140	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
L527139	u7809	m528	HARRY	Then what, Norman?
L527138	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  I didn't say that.
L527137	u7809	m528	HARRY	You mean, you think I'm cracking?
L527136	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
L527135	u7809	m528	HARRY	Am I?
L527134	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
L527133	u7809	m528	HARRY	Gimme another explanation.
L527132	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't believe that, Harry.
L527131	u7809	m528	HARRY	Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
L527130	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
L527129	u7809	m528	HARRY	So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
L527128	u7811	m528	NORMAN	So what?
L527127	u7809	m528	HARRY	"On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an ""Unknown Entry Event."" They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible."
L527126	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't follow you.
L527125	u7809	m528	HARRY	A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
L527124	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not a clue.
L527123	u7809	m528	HARRY	I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
L527122	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
L527112	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
L527111	u7809	m528	HARRY	And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
L527099	u7809	m528	HARRY	Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
L527098	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
L527081	u7809	m528	HARRY	Our present.
L527080	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
L527079	u7809	m528	HARRY	This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
L527078	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Which one?  Let me get the list out.
L527077	u7809	m528	HARRY	This answers one of our questions.
L527070	u7809	m528	HARRY	Time travel.  A black hole.
L527069	u7811	m528	NORMAN	To what?
L527068	u7809	m528	HARRY	Our answer.
L527061	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Whatever I can do to help.
L527060	u7809	m528	HARRY	Nice work, Norman.
L526964	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Look, would you --
L526963	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon, Norman.
L526961	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a second, I --
L526960	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon.
L526959	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, why don't --
L526958	u7809	m528	HARRY	Go ahead.  Ladies first.
L526910	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm fine.
L526909	u7809	m528	HARRY	You sound defensive.
L526908	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not being defensive.
L526907	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't be defensive.
L526906	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Fine.  I'm fine.
L526905	u7809	m528	HARRY	You holding up alright?
L526904	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L526903	u7809	m528	HARRY	How are you feeling, Norman?
L527445	u7809	m528	HARRY	"It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming ""witchcraft"".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics."
L527444	u7814	m528	TED	Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
L527394	u7814	m528	TED	Thank you.
L527393	u7809	m528	HARRY	Good idea, Ted.
L527388	u7809	m528	HARRY	We are friends.
L527387	u7814	m528	TED	What'd you say?
L527370	u7809	m528	HARRY	Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
L527369	u7814	m528	TED	See?  No code.  What'd I say?
L527368	u7809	m528	HARRY	... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
L527351	u7814	m528	TED	Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
L527350	u7809	m528	HARRY	If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
L527347	u7814	m528	TED	It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
L527346	u7809	m528	HARRY	Well, if it's a discharge --
L527253	u7814	m528	TED	Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
L527252	u7809	m528	HARRY	Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
L527251	u7814	m528	TED	Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
L527085	u7809	m528	HARRY	Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
L527084	u7814	m528	TED	Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
L527049	u7809	m528	HARRY	Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
L527048	u7814	m528	TED	Arrived?  From where?
L527047	u7809	m528	HARRY	It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
L527046	u7814	m528	TED	Please.  It must have flown here --
L527045	u7809	m528	HARRY	Meaning it didn't land in the water.
L527044	u7814	m528	TED	Meaning?
L527043	u7809	m528	HARRY	We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
L527039	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
L527038	u7814	m528	TED	An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
L527035	u7809	m528	HARRY	Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
L527034	u7814	m528	TED	If it is an alien spacecraft --
L527033	u7809	m528	HARRY	Do you?
L527032	u7814	m528	TED	Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
L527031	u7809	m528	HARRY	All the facts you need are right in front of you.
L527026	u7814	m528	TED	Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
L527025	u7809	m528	HARRY	Think about it.
L527024	u7814	m528	TED	Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
L527023	u7809	m528	HARRY	Is it?
L527022	u7814	m528	TED	But it's impossible.
L527021	u7809	m528	HARRY	A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
L527020	u7814	m528	TED	Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
L527019	u7809	m528	HARRY	You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
L527016	u7809	m528	HARRY	That's right.
L527015	u7814	m528	TED	English?
L526971	u7809	m528	HARRY	Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
L526970	u7814	m528	TED	Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
L526968	u7814	m528	TED	Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
L526967	u7809	m528	HARRY	Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
L526952	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
L526951	u7814	m528	TED	It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
L526917	u7809	m528	HARRY	Just one of Norman's many secrets.
L526916	u7814	m528	TED	What is it, Harry?
L526915	u7809	m528	HARRY	She told me what you said, Norman.
L526914	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
L526913	u7814	m528	TED	What does Norman already know?
L526912	u7809	m528	HARRY	To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
L526911	u7814	m528	TED	What'd you say to him?
L527608	u7811	m528	NORMAN	About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
L527607	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	What was that, sir?
L527606	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
L527605	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
L527604	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth and Harry?
L527603	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	The others, sir?
L527602	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How are the others?
L527601	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
L527600	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The ships?
L527599	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
L527598	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Does this mean what I think it means?
L527597	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	Norman Johnson.
L526783	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Told me what?
L526782	u7812	m528	OFFICER	You mean they haven't told you yet?
L526781	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526780	u7812	m528	OFFICER	By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
L526779	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Really?
L526778	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
L526777	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Captain who?
L526776	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
L526775	u7812	m528	OFFICER	This way, sir.
L526774	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, they didn't say --
L526773	u7812	m528	OFFICER	No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
L526772	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
L526771	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
L526770	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
L526769	u7813	m528	PILOT	Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
L526768	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Geologists?  At a plane crash?
L526767	u7813	m528	PILOT	Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
L526766	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Who's everyone?
L526765	u7813	m528	PILOT	Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
L526764	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Know what?
L526763	u7813	m528	PILOT	You mean you don't know?
L526762	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526761	u7813	m528	PILOT	Huh?
L526760	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526759	u7813	m528	PILOT	Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
L526758	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You've heard of me?
L526757	u7813	m528	PILOT	Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
L526756	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
L527522	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
L527521	u7814	m528	TED	Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
L527479	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not sure.
L527478	u7814	m528	TED	You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
L527475	u7814	m528	TED	Not that I know of.  Why?
L527474	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
L527473	u7814	m528	TED	Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
L527472	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What was it?
L527449	u7814	m528	TED	Why's that?
L527448	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
L527424	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"When he uses a phrase like ""I am Happy"", I think we should think twice about what we ask him."
L527423	u7814	m528	TED	You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
L527402	u7814	m528	TED	Unless it's an act.
L527401	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, he's polite.
L527367	u7814	m528	TED	"Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that ""someone went to a lot of trouble, try again"" bullshit.  And ""impotent"".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick."
L527366	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
L527365	u7814	m528	TED	Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
L527364	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The creature?
L527363	u7814	m528	TED	Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
L527362	u7811	m528	NORMAN	This is like nursery school.
L527361	u7814	m528	TED	Try this one.
L527360	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Please, Ted.
L527359	u7814	m528	TED	Squint harder.
L527358	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't see anything.
L527357	u7814	m528	TED	Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
L527356	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You mean a picture?
L527355	u7814	m528	TED	It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
L527354	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Like what?
L527353	u7814	m528	TED	He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
L527011	u7814	m528	TED	Still, make a note I recognized that.
L527010	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
L527009	u7814	m528	TED	Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
L526973	u7814	m528	TED	You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
L526972	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You want me to try?
L526902	u7814	m528	TED	He's a pussy.
L526901	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He wasn't feeling well.
L526754	u7815	m528	WIFE	They never used to send a Navy car.
L526753	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.
L526752	u7815	m528	WIFE	Was it a military crash?
L526751	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L526750	u7815	m528	WIFE	There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
L526749	u7815	m528	WIFE	How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
L526748	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
L526747	u7815	m528	WIFE	Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
L526746	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Four.  Four years --
L526745	u7815	m528	WIFE	Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
L526744	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't be so supportive, honey.
L526743	u7815	m528	WIFE	In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
L526742	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
L526741	u7815	m528	WIFE	There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
L526740	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You seen my suitcase?
L526739	u7815	m528	WIFE	What kind of a crash was it?
L573249	u8117	m551	LUKE	<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
L573248	u8125	m551	TODD	What?
L573247	u8117	m551	LUKE	You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
L573238	u8117	m551	LUKE	It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
L573237	u8125	m551	TODD	These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
L573224	u8125	m551	TODD	Greetings fellow sheep counter.
L573223	u8117	m551	LUKE	Greetings fellow insomniac.
L573222	u8125	m551	TODD	Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
L573493	u8123	m551	NELL	Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
L573492	u8117	m551	LUKE	Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
L573391	u8117	m551	LUKE	It's somebody's idea of a joke.
L573390	u8123	m551	NELL	Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
L573337	u8117	m551	LUKE	I did okay.
L573336	u8123	m551	NELL	Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
L573335	u8117	m551	LUKE	Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
L573334	u8123	m551	NELL	The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
L573235	u8117	m551	LUKE	Who's Watts?
L573234	u8123	m551	NELL	I only saw Theo drive up.
L573217	u8117	m551	LUKE	Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
L573216	u8123	m551	NELL	Well, I... uh...
L573215	u8117	m551	LUKE	And what kind of sleeper?
L573214	u8123	m551	NELL	Uh... Nell Vance...
L573213	u8117	m551	LUKE	Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
L573552	u8119	m551	MARROW	Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
L573551	u8117	m551	LUKE	You're not telling us something.
L573539	u8119	m551	MARROW	Just stay there, Nell!
L573538	u8117	m551	LUKE	It's not going to hold your weight.
L573517	u8117	m551	LUKE	She got the child labor stuff from me.
L573516	u8119	m551	MARROW	It's a question.
L573515	u8117	m551	LUKE	Is that the question of compassion or science?
L573514	u8119	m551	MARROW	You get your money.
L573513	u8117	m551	LUKE	Do we still get paid for the week?
L573512	u8119	m551	MARROW	I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
L573346	u8117	m551	LUKE	There's a carriage house around back.
L573345	u8119	m551	MARROW	And those are Luke's and mine.
L573313	u8119	m551	MARROW	Go ahead.
L573312	u8117	m551	LUKE	Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
L573288	u8119	m551	MARROW	I've read your tests.
L573287	u8117	m551	LUKE	Why?
L573286	u8119	m551	MARROW	Because... well, I know I can trust you.
L573285	u8117	m551	LUKE	Sure.
L573284	u8119	m551	MARROW	Luke, can I talk to you?
L573283	u8119	m551	MARROW	Yeah.
L573282	u8117	m551	LUKE	That could have been worse.
L573265	u8119	m551	MARROW	I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
L573264	u8117	m551	LUKE	So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
L573226	u8117	m551	LUKE	Greetings.
L573225	u8119	m551	MARROW	And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
L573582	u8117	m551	LUKE	We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
L573581	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell!
L573577	u8117	m551	LUKE	Where in the hell can she be.
L573576	u8124	m551	THEO	Was sure she'd be in here.
L573570	u8117	m551	LUKE	-- how much is this car worth?
L573569	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell --
L573550	u8124	m551	THEO	Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
L573549	u8117	m551	LUKE	You used the wrong test.
L573528	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe someday.
L573527	u8117	m551	LUKE	You want company?
L573526	u8124	m551	THEO	Yeah.
L573525	u8117	m551	LUKE	All night?
L573524	u8124	m551	THEO	That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
L573523	u8117	m551	LUKE	You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
L573522	u8124	m551	THEO	We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
L573469	u8117	m551	LUKE	The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
L573468	u8124	m551	THEO	Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
L573396	u8124	m551	THEO	No.
L573395	u8117	m551	LUKE	So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
L573394	u8124	m551	THEO	You could have.
L573393	u8117	m551	LUKE	I didn't do it.
L573348	u8124	m551	THEO	He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
L573347	u8117	m551	LUKE	Well, this lot is full!
L573309	u8124	m551	THEO	Luke.
L573308	u8117	m551	LUKE	Hey!  I heard screaming...
L573291	u8124	m551	THEO	And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
L573290	u8117	m551	LUKE	He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
L573252	u8117	m551	LUKE	Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
L573251	u8124	m551	THEO	The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
L573099	u8119	m551	MARROW	This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
L573098	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
L573097	u8119	m551	MARROW	She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
L573096	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	I, I just can't...
L573095	u8119	m551	MARROW	No.
L573094	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Does she know that's why you're using her?
L573093	u8119	m551	MARROW	No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
L573092	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	You don't believe in the paranormal.
L573091	u8119	m551	MARROW	And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
L573090	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
L573089	u8119	m551	MARROW	Mary, I'll meet you outside.
L573088	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Are you working with her?
L573087	u8119	m551	MARROW	But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
L573086	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
L573085	u8119	m551	MARROW	No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
L573084	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	And that will be a good place to end this study.
L573083	u8119	m551	MARROW	Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
L573081	u8119	m551	MARROW	Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
L573080	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	It's still an electric shock!
L573606	u8123	m551	NELL	Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
L573605	u8119	m551	MARROW	What'll happen to us, Nell?
L573595	u8123	m551	NELL	No --
L573594	u8119	m551	MARROW	Come on.
L573593	u8123	m551	NELL	My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
L573592	u8119	m551	MARROW	No.
L573568	u8123	m551	NELL	Then who called me?
L573567	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
L573566	u8123	m551	NELL	But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
L573544	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell.  You will come here now.
L573543	u8123	m551	NELL	The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
L573502	u8123	m551	NELL	Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
L573501	u8119	m551	MARROW	Why would we want to do that, Nell?
L573495	u8123	m551	NELL	It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
L573494	u8119	m551	MARROW	I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
L573486	u8123	m551	NELL	And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
L573485	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
L573433	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
L573432	u8119	m551	MARROW	What is that tune?
L573431	u8123	m551	NELL	It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
L573430	u8119	m551	MARROW	I don't know.
L573429	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573428	u8119	m551	MARROW	Someone is playing with you.
L573411	u8123	m551	NELL	Sure.
L573410	u8119	m551	MARROW	You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
L573409	u8123	m551	NELL	Welcome Home.
L573408	u8119	m551	MARROW	It was.
L573407	u8123	m551	NELL	It was a stupid thing to do.
L573406	u8119	m551	MARROW	I don't know.
L573405	u8123	m551	NELL	Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
L573404	u8119	m551	MARROW	I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
L573403	u8123	m551	NELL	Are you coming to confess?
L573386	u8119	m551	MARROW	No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
L573385	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
L573384	u8119	m551	MARROW	Hmm.
L573383	u8123	m551	NELL	I got more scared.
L573382	u8119	m551	MARROW	And then what happened?
L573381	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.
L573380	u8119	m551	MARROW	Like she smelled it too?
L573379	u8123	m551	NELL	I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
L573378	u8119	m551	MARROW	What happened after you smelled it?
L573377	u8123	m551	NELL	I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
L573376	u8119	m551	MARROW	So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
L573375	u8123	m551	NELL	In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
L573374	u8119	m551	MARROW	All right...
L573373	u8123	m551	NELL	It was very specific.
L573372	u8119	m551	MARROW	What did it smell like?
L573371	u8123	m551	NELL	That smell... oh, God.
L573370	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell!  What's wrong?
L573326	u8119	m551	MARROW	For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
L573325	u8123	m551	NELL	Sorry.
L573318	u8119	m551	MARROW	How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
L573317	u8123	m551	NELL	Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
L573316	u8119	m551	MARROW	The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
L573271	u8119	m551	MARROW	But there's a sad catch to the story.
L573270	u8123	m551	NELL	All the carvings.
L573258	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
L573257	u8119	m551	MARROW	You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
L573231	u8119	m551	MARROW	Well... we're glad to have you.
L573230	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
L573229	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
L573228	u8123	m551	NELL	You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
L573227	u8119	m551	MARROW	Eleanor, how was the drive?
L573273	u8119	m551	MARROW	There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
L573272	u8120	m551	MARY	What happened?
L573121	u8119	m551	MARROW	Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
L573120	u8120	m551	MARY	This is where we're going?
L573119	u8119	m551	MARROW	That?  That's Hill House.
L573118	u8120	m551	MARY	What's this?  What's this... this picture?
L573113	u8119	m551	MARROW	Good.
L573112	u8120	m551	MARY	Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
L573111	u8119	m551	MARROW	Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
L573110	u8120	m551	MARY	How'd I know it was for you?
L573109	u8119	m551	MARROW	Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
L573108	u8120	m551	MARY	Test it.
L573107	u8119	m551	MARROW	You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
L573105	u8120	m551	MARY	You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
L573104	u8119	m551	MARROW	What?
L573103	u8120	m551	MARY	You know what he's really upset about?
L573627	u8124	m551	THEO	But the experiment was a failure.
L573626	u8119	m551	MARROW	I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
L573625	u8124	m551	THEO	I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
L573614	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell, what do we do?
L573613	u8124	m551	THEO	Oh God, we can't get out!
L573554	u8119	m551	MARROW	No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
L573553	u8124	m551	THEO	He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
L573548	u8119	m551	MARROW	I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
L573547	u8124	m551	THEO	She needs help.
L573520	u8124	m551	THEO	Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
L573519	u8119	m551	MARROW	Is she asleep?
L573497	u8124	m551	THEO	How could you do this to people?
L573496	u8119	m551	MARROW	Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
L573480	u8124	m551	THEO	It's okay... we're all here...
L573479	u8119	m551	MARROW	Get a blanket!
L573342	u8119	m551	MARROW	Mary came with me.
L573341	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe they're Mary's.
L573329	u8119	m551	MARROW	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
L573328	u8124	m551	THEO	Well this is a cozy breakfast.
L573267	u8119	m551	MARROW	Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
L573266	u8124	m551	THEO	When do we take the tests?
L573233	u8124	m551	THEO	No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
L573232	u8119	m551	MARROW	Have either of you seen David Watts?
L573425	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
L573424	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573423	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	She was unhappy.
L573422	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.
L573421	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Why'd she kill herself?
L573420	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573415	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
L573414	u8123	m551	NELL	Who?
L573413	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	That's where she hanged herself.
L573149	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
L573148	u8123	m551	NELL	Is there something about the house?
L573147	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
L573146	u8123	m551	NELL	Why do you need a chain like that?
L573144	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
L573143	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
L573142	u8123	m551	NELL	Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
L573141	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
L573140	u8123	m551	NELL	Oh!  You scared me.
L573139	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	What do you want?
L573185	u8123	m551	NELL	No one will come any nearer than that.
L573184	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
L573166	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
L573165	u8123	m551	NELL	Why would we --
L573164	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
L573163	u8123	m551	NELL	Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
L573162	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
L573161	u8123	m551	NELL	They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
L573156	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	So far.
L573155	u8123	m551	NELL	Mrs. Dudley.
L573154	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
L573590	u8124	m551	THEO	Then let's go get you one.
L573589	u8123	m551	NELL	Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
L573586	u8123	m551	NELL	Just had to be sure.
L573585	u8124	m551	THEO	What'd you come back for, babe?
L573561	u8124	m551	THEO	Come on!  Why are we waiting?
L573560	u8123	m551	NELL	They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
L573511	u8124	m551	THEO	I do.
L573510	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't think I want any.
L573509	u8124	m551	THEO	I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
L573500	u8123	m551	NELL	-- but the painting!
L573499	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
L573498	u8123	m551	NELL	This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
L573484	u8123	m551	NELL	Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
L573483	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell, what happened?
L573472	u8123	m551	NELL	Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
L573471	u8124	m551	THEO	Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
L573466	u8123	m551	NELL	-- What do you think?
L573465	u8124	m551	THEO	Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
L573458	u8124	m551	THEO	Okay.
L573457	u8123	m551	NELL	I think so.
L573456	u8124	m551	THEO	Are you sure?
L573454	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
L573453	u8124	m551	THEO	My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
L573452	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know, you know...
L573451	u8124	m551	THEO	You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
L573449	u8124	m551	THEO	I have a loft.
L573448	u8123	m551	NELL	I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
L573447	u8124	m551	THEO	Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
L573446	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
L573445	u8123	m551	NELL	Red.  What else?
L573444	u8124	m551	THEO	Well?
L573443	u8123	m551	NELL	I've never had a pedicure before.
L573442	u8124	m551	THEO	Just think about one thing right now: What color?
L573441	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know what to think anymore.
L573440	u8124	m551	THEO	Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
L573438	u8124	m551	THEO	Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
L573437	u8123	m551	NELL	There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
L573436	u8124	m551	THEO	That's so sad.
L573400	u8124	m551	THEO	I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
L573399	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573398	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe you did it yourself.
L573397	u8123	m551	NELL	Theo... Did you?
L573369	u8123	m551	NELL	No, it's getting worse.
L573368	u8124	m551	THEO	Is it over?
L573367	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
L573366	u8123	m551	NELL	David?
L573358	u8123	m551	NELL	David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
L573357	u8124	m551	THEO	David.
L573356	u8123	m551	NELL	What's his first name?
L573355	u8124	m551	THEO	Watts?
L573350	u8124	m551	THEO	Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
L573349	u8123	m551	NELL	How could he have left without his keys?
L573332	u8124	m551	THEO	I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
L573331	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
L573315	u8123	m551	NELL	You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
L573314	u8124	m551	THEO	If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
L573303	u8124	m551	THEO	You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
L573302	u8123	m551	NELL	Good night, Theo.
L573301	u8124	m551	THEO	No.  The world has missed you.
L573300	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.  I've missed it.
L573299	u8124	m551	THEO	You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
L573293	u8124	m551	THEO	The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
L573292	u8123	m551	NELL	A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
L573209	u8124	m551	THEO	You're okay.
L573208	u8123	m551	NELL	I love this house.  I really love this house.
L573203	u8123	m551	NELL	I know.
L573202	u8124	m551	THEO	Jeez.
L573198	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
L573197	u8124	m551	THEO	A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
L573196	u8123	m551	NELL	No.
L573195	u8124	m551	THEO	My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
L573194	u8123	m551	NELL	Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
L573193	u8124	m551	THEO	Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
L573192	u8123	m551	NELL	Not really.
L573191	u8124	m551	THEO	That depends.
L573190	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
L573189	u8124	m551	THEO	What do you do?
L573188	u8123	m551	NELL	That's why we're here.
L573187	u8124	m551	THEO	Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
L573178	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know what you mean.
L573177	u8124	m551	THEO	Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
L573176	u8123	m551	NELL	It's all I could afford.
L573175	u8124	m551	THEO	That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
L573174	u8123	m551	NELL	Fifteen dollars.
L573173	u8124	m551	THEO	What did it cost?
L573172	u8123	m551	NELL	This?  It's from a thrift shop.
L573171	u8124	m551	THEO	And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
L576746	u8159	m554	BAILEY	I'm in.
L576745	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
L576730	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Great.
L576729	u8159	m554	BAILEY	Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
L576338	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	No.
L576337	u8159	m554	BAILEY	There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
L576336	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	It better be good.
L576335	u8159	m554	BAILEY	Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
L576226	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
L576225	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Why not?
L576224	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
L576223	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
L576222	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	Looks like the curse is still at work.
L576220	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
L576219	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	Anything missin'?
L576218	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Someone broke into this room.
L576217	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
L576216	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
L576777	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
L576776	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
L576775	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
L576774	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Sweet Jesus!
L576624	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
L576623	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
L576622	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
L576621	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I'll go down and speak to him.
L576620	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
L576619	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
L576486	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I appreciate that.
L576485	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
L576491	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
L576490	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I don't want to scare people.
L576489	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Yes.
L576488	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Do they have to wear uniforms?
L576487	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
L576484	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
L576483	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
L576482	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
L576481	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
L576827	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
L576826	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Fifteen... what's next?
L576825	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Oh Jesus...
L576824	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
L576823	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
L576821	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
L576820	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Hurry up!
L576819	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
L576818	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Let's go!
L576817	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Battery's dead.  Shit.
L576816	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Calm down.  I found it!
L576815	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Forget it!
L576814	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
L576813	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	What's the combination?
L576812	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Behind you.
L576811	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Where's the walk-in safe?
L576810	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
L576789	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
L576788	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
L576787	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Where the hell are you?
L576786	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
L576699	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	Like hell!
L576698	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Ippolito!  Get back here!
L576696	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You said the system couldn't fail!
L576695	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
L576694	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What doors?
L576693	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
L576562	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
L576561	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
L576560	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
L576559	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
L576558	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
L576557	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
L576556	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
L576985	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
L576984	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
L576867	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Everybody.  Get behind me.
L576866	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
L576865	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I smell it.  It's here.
L576860	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
L576859	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	The sub-basement?
L576858	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
L576851	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
L576850	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
L576552	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
L576551	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I think I should come with you.
L576550	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Apparently it's huge.
L576549	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	How big is the sub-basement?
L576400	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
L576399	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
L576398	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
L576392	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Correct.
L576391	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
L576390	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
L576389	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What happened to them?
L576371	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Oh.
L576370	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
L576369	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
L576368	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I believed them.
L576367	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
L576366	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
L576365	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	"I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than ""the dog ate my homework""."
L576341	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Unfortunately, no.
L576340	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You're kidding.
L576339	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	If you don't mind, this could be important.
L576334	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
L576333	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	So the method of death is the only connection?
L576332	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
L576331	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
L576330	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
L576329	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Call me Vince.
L576328	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Lieutenant --
L576327	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
L576326	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
L576325	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
L576324	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
L576323	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
L576322	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
L576299	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
L576298	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Whose footprints?
L576297	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
L576296	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where's the head?
L576295	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	We need light in here, stat.
L576294	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Mind if I have a look?
L576293	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What's left of it.
L576292	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	The body?
L576291	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
L576290	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
L576289	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
L576288	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Who are you?  The undertaker?
L576998	u8164	m554	FROCK	The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
L576997	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
L576538	u8164	m554	FROCK	This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
L576537	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Pardon my French, but bull shit.
L576536	u8164	m554	FROCK	Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
L576532	u8164	m554	FROCK	May I see that?
L576531	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Look.  It's some kind of letter.
L576509	u8164	m554	FROCK	I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
L576508	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	This place is a maze.
L576945	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I'd say we're in its home.
L576944	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
L576941	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
L576940	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What's that doing here?
L576939	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Dr. John Whittlesley.
L576938	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What does it say?
L576936	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	All right everybody, hold up!
L576935	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What's that?
L576934	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Not so loud.
L576933	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
L576888	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Oh shit.
L576887	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
L576862	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
L576861	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
L576843	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I know.
L576842	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	It's still back there!
L576691	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
L576690	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What happened?!
L576664	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
L576663	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Got my hands full here.
L576662	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Dr. Green has to see you!
L576661	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What is it?
L576660	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Lieutenant!  It's me.
L576388	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
L576387	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
L576386	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Curious.  There's something missing.
L576385	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
L576384	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
L576383	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	What are we talking about here?
L576377	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
L576376	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I hope you liked it.
L576375	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
L576374	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
L576992	u8164	m554	FROCK	Look who's here, Margo.
L576991	u8170	m554	MARGO	Dr. Frock?
L576841	u8164	m554	FROCK	Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
L576840	u8170	m554	MARGO	We will.
L576839	u8164	m554	FROCK	Come back and get me.
L576830	u8170	m554	MARGO	No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
L576829	u8164	m554	FROCK	I'm coming with you.
L576806	u8170	m554	MARGO	That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
L576805	u8164	m554	FROCK	We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
L576804	u8170	m554	MARGO	None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
L576707	u8164	m554	FROCK	It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
L576706	u8170	m554	MARGO	What's that?
L576705	u8164	m554	FROCK	Don't stop now.
L576704	u8170	m554	MARGO	Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
L576702	u8170	m554	MARGO	I think so.
L576701	u8164	m554	FROCK	Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
L576700	u8170	m554	MARGO	What's going on?
L576657	u8164	m554	FROCK	It's like ringing the dinner bell.
L576656	u8170	m554	MARGO	And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
L576655	u8164	m554	FROCK	Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
L576654	u8170	m554	MARGO	With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
L576653	u8164	m554	FROCK	So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
L576652	u8170	m554	MARGO	"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm... poor eyesight.  ""External mucoid nasal glands,""... very keen scent... ""Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."""
L576651	u8164	m554	FROCK	"Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  ""He Who Walks on All Fours."""
L576650	u8170	m554	MARGO	"All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  ""Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters."" That means it's highly intelligent. ""Quadrupedal."""
L576635	u8170	m554	MARGO	"But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  ""Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."""
L576634	u8164	m554	FROCK	That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
L576633	u8170	m554	MARGO	Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
L576630	u8170	m554	MARGO	Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
L576629	u8164	m554	FROCK	Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
L576628	u8170	m554	MARGO	Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
L576627	u8164	m554	FROCK	Like the claw.
L576578	u8164	m554	FROCK	They're eggs.
L576577	u8170	m554	MARGO	What are they?
L576576	u8164	m554	FROCK	Margo, these aren't seed pods.
L576569	u8164	m554	FROCK	You're right.
L576568	u8170	m554	MARGO	Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
L576567	u8164	m554	FROCK	I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
L576566	u8170	m554	MARGO	What is it?
L576565	u8164	m554	FROCK	Let me see the plant press.
L576564	u8170	m554	MARGO	A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
L576563	u8164	m554	FROCK	I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
L576311	u8164	m554	FROCK	Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
L576310	u8170	m554	MARGO	That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
L576258	u8164	m554	FROCK	Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
L576257	u8170	m554	MARGO	You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
L576256	u8164	m554	FROCK	This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
L576255	u8164	m554	FROCK	You must.
L576254	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm not giving up.
L576253	u8164	m554	FROCK	Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
L576252	u8164	m554	FROCK	Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
L576251	u8170	m554	MARGO	Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
L576250	u8164	m554	FROCK	With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
L576249	u8170	m554	MARGO	My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
L576248	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
L576247	u8170	m554	MARGO	How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
L576246	u8164	m554	FROCK	No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
L576245	u8170	m554	MARGO	Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
L576244	u8164	m554	FROCK	Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
L576242	u8164	m554	FROCK	That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
L576241	u8170	m554	MARGO	We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
L576240	u8164	m554	FROCK	Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
L576239	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't believe it.
L576238	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
L576996	u8164	m554	FROCK	They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
L576995	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
L576837	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Footsteps!
L576836	u8164	m554	FROCK	What's that?
L576834	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	He's right.
L576833	u8164	m554	FROCK	Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
L576803	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't believe it.
L576802	u8164	m554	FROCK	We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
L576546	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
L576545	u8164	m554	FROCK	I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
L576544	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where is that?
L576543	u8164	m554	FROCK	Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
L576542	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
L576541	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes.
L576540	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
L576535	u8164	m554	FROCK	Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast.
L576534	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Read it out loud.
L576533	u8164	m554	FROCK	It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
L576528	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I wouldn't be so sure.
L576527	u8164	m554	FROCK	This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
L576526	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
L576525	u8164	m554	FROCK	Something tried to get into this room!
L576511	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
L576510	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
L576507	u8164	m554	FROCK	They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
L576506	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How many storage areas are there?
L576505	u8164	m554	FROCK	Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
L576504	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
L576208	u8170	m554	MARGO	Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
L576207	u8165	m554	HENRY	Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
L576206	u8170	m554	MARGO	Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
L576205	u8165	m554	HENRY	Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
L576204	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
L576203	u8165	m554	HENRY	What do you do?
L576202	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes, I do.
L576201	u8165	m554	HENRY	You work here?
L576355	u8165	m554	HENRY	You're color blind.
L576354	u8169	m554	LARRY	They were yellow!
L576353	u8165	m554	HENRY	They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
L576352	u8169	m554	LARRY	It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
L576351	u8165	m554	HENRY	Like this.
L576350	u8169	m554	LARRY	And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
L576349	u8169	m554	LARRY	Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
L576348	u8165	m554	HENRY	Not that big.
L576347	u8169	m554	LARRY	Big as a house.
L576346	u8165	m554	HENRY	We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
L576280	u8165	m554	HENRY	I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
L576279	u8169	m554	LARRY	What is it?
L576278	u8165	m554	HENRY	Quiet!
L576270	u8165	m554	HENRY	Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
L576269	u8169	m554	LARRY	I don't want to go this way.
L576268	u8165	m554	HENRY	Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
L576267	u8169	m554	LARRY	We're not supposed to go back there.
L576264	u8169	m554	LARRY	Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
L576263	u8165	m554	HENRY	She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
L576262	u8169	m554	LARRY	This room sucks.
L576715	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Keep the animal quiet.
L576714	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Oh no.  I smell it.
L576711	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Another storage room.
L576710	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Jesus, what is this?
L576617	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Quiet.
L576616	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Oh... my... God!
L576613	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
L576612	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
L576611	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
L576610	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
L576606	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	He's right.  Follow me.
L576605	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
L576597	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Get back!  Now!
L576596	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Argo!  Hobbes!
L576590	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Holy mother, what is that?
L576589	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Stop!
L576586	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
L576585	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Shut them up!
L576584	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Keep the light up.  I can't see.
L576583	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	They've got something.
L576581	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
L576580	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
L576579	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
L576990	u8170	m554	MARGO	Okay.
L576989	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
L576988	u8170	m554	MARGO	How about lunch?
L576987	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Got to finish this thesis sometime.
L576855	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
L576854	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Is Dr. Frock safe!
L576645	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
L576644	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Eats them?
L576643	u8170	m554	MARGO	Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
L576642	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	So what?
L576641	u8170	m554	MARGO	This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
L576639	u8170	m554	MARGO	Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
L576638	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	"4-monoxytocin is... ""A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."""
L576637	u8170	m554	MARGO	What kind of hormones?
L576636	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
L576626	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's reptilian.
L576625	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What kind of egg is it?
L576499	u8170	m554	MARGO	There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
L576498	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
L576497	u8170	m554	MARGO	Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
L576493	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
L576492	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What do you make of it, Margo?
L576316	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What's that?
L576315	u8170	m554	MARGO	Mbwun.
L576304	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
L576303	u8170	m554	MARGO	For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
L576235	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
L576234	u8170	m554	MARGO	That's impossible.
L576233	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Frock's been fired.
L576232	u8170	m554	MARGO	What?
L576231	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Margo, you haven't heard?
L576230	u8170	m554	MARGO	I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
L576229	u8170	m554	MARGO	But at what a price.
L576228	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
L576994	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
L576993	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
L576980	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You have to.  Do it now!
L576979	u8170	m554	MARGO	I can't!
L576978	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
L576977	u8170	m554	MARGO	Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
L576976	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I have to shoot.
L576975	u8170	m554	MARGO	Just like John.  He won't listen.
L576962	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
L576961	u8170	m554	MARGO	You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
L576960	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't believe it.
L576959	u8170	m554	MARGO	That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
L576958	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What?
L576957	u8170	m554	MARGO	No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
L576947	u8170	m554	MARGO	Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
L576946	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We're not going to make the storage room!
L576931	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It's coming.  Run.
L576930	u8170	m554	MARGO	You smell that?
L576929	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Oh God!  Help!
L576928	u8170	m554	MARGO	Help someone!
L576911	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
L576910	u8170	m554	MARGO	That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
L576909	u8170	m554	MARGO	The answer's right in front of us.
L576908	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How?
L576907	u8170	m554	MARGO	We have to try and draw it off!
L576883	u8170	m554	MARGO	I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
L576882	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	For what?
L576881	u8170	m554	MARGO	No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
L576880	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Then it won't go after the others?
L576879	u8170	m554	MARGO	I think... it means it's full.
L576878	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
L576877	u8170	m554	MARGO	Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
L576876	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What happened?
L576874	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It's scared of me.
L576873	u8170	m554	MARGO	What is it doing?
L576869	u8170	m554	MARGO	What are you going to do?
L576868	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Hide quickly!
L576857	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
L576856	u8170	m554	MARGO	Is there another way around?
L576848	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Vince!
L576847	u8170	m554	MARGO	The planetarium!
L576846	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	That was D'Agosta.
L576832	u8170	m554	MARGO	Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
L576831	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
L576808	u8170	m554	MARGO	We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
L576807	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
L576801	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
L576800	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
L576799	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
L576727	u8170	m554	MARGO	That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
L576726	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
L576725	u8170	m554	MARGO	Wounded?
L576724	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Gone.
L576723	u8170	m554	MARGO	You're not.  Where is it?
L576722	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
L576721	u8170	m554	MARGO	Pendergast?  Are you all right?
L576502	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
L576501	u8170	m554	MARGO	When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
L576500	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Genetic damage?
L576468	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
L576467	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What was it?
L576466	u8170	m554	MARGO	All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
L576465	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	They're all heavily armed.
L576464	u8170	m554	MARGO	I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
L576463	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Dr. Green...
L576459	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	All right.  If you're positive.
L576458	u8170	m554	MARGO	That's not what I saw.
L576457	u8170	m554	MARGO	Behind me.  Over there.
L576456	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where did you see it?
L576455	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
L576454	u8170	m554	MARGO	You were behind me?  Running after me?
L576453	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
L576452	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't know.
L576451	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What happened?
L576445	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
L576444	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
L576443	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where would we find it?
L576442	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Would you mind showing it to me?
L576441	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
L576440	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
L576439	u8170	m554	MARGO	My God.  Then it was an animal.
L576438	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
L576437	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't understand.
L576436	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
L576435	u8170	m554	MARGO	No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
L576434	u8170	m554	MARGO	No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
L576433	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What happened?
L576432	u8170	m554	MARGO	"Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a ""monster species"".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years."
L576431	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	A monster?
L576430	u8170	m554	MARGO	A legendary monster called Mbwun.
L576429	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
L576428	u8170	m554	MARGO	He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
L576427	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You were afraid of him, weren't you?
L576426	u8170	m554	MARGO	That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
L576425	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
L576424	u8170	m554	MARGO	How did you know that?
L576423	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You were going to be married.
L576422	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
L576421	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You loved him.
L576420	u8170	m554	MARGO	John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
L576419	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
L576418	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't understand.
L576417	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
L576416	u8170	m554	MARGO	And John?
L576415	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
L576414	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You have time to talk?
L576413	u8170	m554	MARGO	If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
L576412	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Maybe not.
L576411	u8170	m554	MARGO	Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
L576410	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
L576409	u8170	m554	MARGO	With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
L576408	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How does it work?
L576407	u8170	m554	MARGO	An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
L576406	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
L580484	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	You're not FBI agents.
L580483	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Well, we're FBI agents.
L580482	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	We don't even know you.
L580481	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think you better tell us.
L580478	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
L580477	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	Not supposed to talk about it.
L580475	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	Yeah.
L580474	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Do you live around here?
L580219	u8197	m556	MULDER	Sorry. Don't have one.
L580218	u8189	m556	BARMAID	Why don't you go home to the old lady --
L580217	u8197	m556	MULDER	Does what?
L580216	u8189	m556	BARMAID	I think that about does it, Spooky.
L580215	u8197	m556	MULDER	"What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. ""Spooky,"" they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time."
L580214	u8189	m556	BARMAID	What do you do?
L580213	u8189	m556	BARMAID	A woman?  Work.
L580212	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yup.
L580211	u8189	m556	BARMAID	Poopy day?
L580646	u8190	m556	BYERS	Me?
L580645	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need your clothes, Byers.
L580635	u8197	m556	MULDER	They took her --
L580634	u8190	m556	BYERS	You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
L580633	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
L580629	u8197	m556	MULDER	When was that?
L580628	u8190	m556	BYERS	They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
L580626	u8197	m556	MULDER	Penetration but not perforation.
L580625	u8190	m556	BYERS	You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
L580624	u8197	m556	MULDER	What am I doing here?
L580733	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
L580732	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No, they don't.
L580731	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
L580730	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What is it you find incredible?
L580557	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Agent Mulder.
L580556	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Working with?
L580555	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
L580554	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Nothing completely conclusive --
L580553	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
L580552	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yes. I know.
L580551	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
L580550	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
L580549	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
L580548	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yes.
L580547	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	You've been back to Dallas?
L580545	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Evidence of what?
L580544	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
L580543	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Special Agent Scully --
L580287	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
L580286	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Of what?
L580285	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
L580284	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
L580283	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Incinerate it. Like the others.
L580282	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	And if it's unsuccessful?
L580281	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
L580280	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
L580279	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
L580278	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	How can this be?
L580277	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
L580276	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	This man's still alive.
L580275	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
L580274	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Brought on by what?
L580273	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
L580272	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Yes.
L580271	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	You've got something to show me.
L580449	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Kurtzweil, we think.
L580448	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Who?
L580447	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
L580446	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Do they know?
L580445	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	There are complications.
L580444	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
L580428	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Into what?
L580427	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
L580417	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
L580416	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Who called this meeting?
L580413	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Is it an emergency?
L580412	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	We have a situation. The members are assembling.
L580411	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Yes.
L580331	u8197	m556	MULDER	No. Don't bother.
L580330	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
L580329	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
L580328	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You looking for him for some other reason?
L580327	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
L580326	u8197	m556	MULDER	What's that?
L580325	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
L580324	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Looking for him for what?
L580323	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm looking for him.
L580322	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You got some kind of business with him?
L580321	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
L580398	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	Show you right on a map.
L580397	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
L580386	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	No. Just fossils, far as I know.
L580385	u8197	m556	MULDER	Have you examined them?
L580384	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
L580383	u8197	m556	MULDER	Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
L580382	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
L580381	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
L580581	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
L580580	u8197	m556	MULDER	Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
L580579	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
L580577	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
L580576	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I told you -- he and I were old friends --
L580575	u8197	m556	MULDER	You didn't know my father --
L580574	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I've been using you?!
L580573	u8197	m556	MULDER	You've been using me --
L580572	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Yeah, well I don't have them all.
L580571	u8197	m556	MULDER	You told me you had answers.
L580569	u8197	m556	MULDER	Your guess?
L580568	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	That would be my guess.
L580567	u8197	m556	MULDER	A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
L580566	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What do you think?
L580563	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did it look like?
L580562	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	-- You saw this experiment?
L580561	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm not sure. A virus --
L580560	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What?
L580559	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
L580558	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You found something?
L580363	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You can't.
L580362	u8197	m556	MULDER	How can I reach you?
L580361	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
L580360	u8197	m556	MULDER	And they tell me I'm paranoid.
L580359	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
L580358	u8197	m556	MULDER	Negotiating with whom?
L580357	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
L580356	u8197	m556	MULDER	A plague?
L580355	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
L580354	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'll know soon enough.
L580353	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
L580352	u8197	m556	MULDER	What killed those men?
L580351	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
L580350	u8197	m556	MULDER	What was it?
L580348	u8197	m556	MULDER	Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
L580347	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
L580346	u8197	m556	MULDER	It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
L580345	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
L580344	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
L580343	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
L580342	u8197	m556	MULDER	How?
L580341	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
L580340	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I don't either, but it sure sells books.
L580339	u8197	m556	MULDER	Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
L580338	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You know my work?
L580337	u8197	m556	MULDER	You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
L580336	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
L580335	u8197	m556	MULDER	They want to discredit you -- for what?
L580334	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
L580333	u8197	m556	MULDER	Not according to the men in blue.
L580332	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
L580257	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Do you?
L580256	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think you're full of shit.
L580255	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And one little boy.
L580254	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
L580253	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
L580252	u8197	m556	MULDER	Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
L580251	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	That's what I'm saying.
L580250	u8197	m556	MULDER	Before the bomb went off?
L580249	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Those people were already dead.
L580247	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
L580246	u8197	m556	MULDER	The Federal Building was too well guarded.
L580245	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
L580244	u8197	m556	MULDER	He just let it explode.
L580243	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
L580242	u8197	m556	MULDER	And what's that?
L580240	u8197	m556	MULDER	Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
L580239	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
L580238	u8197	m556	MULDER	Who sent you?
L580237	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
L580236	u8197	m556	MULDER	You a reporter?
L580235	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
L580234	u8197	m556	MULDER	How'd you find me?
L580231	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Old friend of your father's.
L580230	u8197	m556	MULDER	I know the name. Why?
L580229	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
L580228	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Yeah, I did.
L580227	u8197	m556	MULDER	You follow me out here for a reason?
L580226	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
L580225	u8197	m556	MULDER	Do I know you?
L580224	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
L580223	u8197	m556	MULDER	How's that?
L580717	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
L580716	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can't go any farther.
L580714	u8197	m556	MULDER	You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
L580713	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where are we?
L580712	u8197	m556	MULDER	We've got to keep moving.
L580710	u8197	m556	MULDER	Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
L580709	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Cold...
L580608	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
L580607	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully --
L580606	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No -- it's --
L580605	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
L580604	u8198	m556	SCULLY	...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
L580603	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
L580602	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully...
L580600	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think... something stung me.
L580599	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What happened?
L580597	u8197	m556	MULDER	You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
L580596	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
L580594	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
L580593	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need you on this, Scully --
L580592	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
L580591	u8197	m556	MULDER	Just like that --
L580590	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I have. I did. It's done.
L580589	u8197	m556	MULDER	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
L580588	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
L580587	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
L580586	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
L580585	u8197	m556	MULDER	You can't quit, Scully.
L580584	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
L580583	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
L580582	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What's wrong?
L580541	u8197	m556	MULDER	I don't know.
L580540	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where'd they go?
L580534	u8197	m556	MULDER	Come on!
L580533	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What are you doing?
L580532	u8197	m556	MULDER	Run.
L580531	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yeah...?
L580530	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully....?
L580528	u8197	m556	MULDER	Maybe. Maybe not.
L580527	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
L580526	u8197	m556	MULDER	You hear that?
L580524	u8197	m556	MULDER	For the purpose of what?
L580523	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
L580522	u8197	m556	MULDER	Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
L580521	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
L580520	u8197	m556	MULDER	Very weird.
L580519	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is weird, Mulder.
L580518	u8197	m556	MULDER	I have no idea.
L580517	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What do you think it is?
L580516	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
L580515	u8197	m556	MULDER	Been where?
L580514	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
L580513	u8197	m556	MULDER	It may be extraterrestrial.
L580512	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder --
L580511	u8197	m556	MULDER	This virus -- it... 
L580510	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
L580509	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yeah, well they may this one.
L580508	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
L580507	u8197	m556	MULDER	That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
L580506	u8198	m556	SCULLY	-- of what exactly?!
L580505	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
L580504	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
L580503	u8197	m556	MULDER	What?
L580502	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is great. This is fitting.
L580501	u8197	m556	MULDER	Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
L580499	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know why I think they went right.
L580498	u8197	m556	MULDER	You think they went left?
L580497	u8198	m556	SCULLY	We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
L580496	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where would they be going?
L580495	u8198	m556	SCULLY	About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
L580494	u8197	m556	MULDER	What are my choices?
L580493	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
L580492	u8197	m556	MULDER	And where are they going with it?
L580491	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know, Mulder.
L580490	u8197	m556	MULDER	Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
L580472	u8197	m556	MULDER	No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
L580471	u8198	m556	SCULLY	All the equipment is brand new.
L580470	u8197	m556	MULDER	Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
L580469	u8198	m556	SCULLY	It looks pretty green for this climate.
L580468	u8197	m556	MULDER	This looks like new grass to you?
L580467	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
L580466	u8197	m556	MULDER	And you've never seen anything like that?
L580465	u8198	m556	SCULLY	The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
L580464	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
L580463	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
L580462	u8197	m556	MULDER	This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
L580461	u8198	m556	SCULLY	He didn't mention a park.
L580394	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
L580393	u8197	m556	MULDER	How was it contracted?
L580392	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
L580391	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did you find?
L580390	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
L580389	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said you weren't coming?
L580378	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
L580377	u8197	m556	MULDER	-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
L580376	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got a hearing tomorrow --
L580375	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
L580374	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder --
L580373	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
L580372	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know.
L580371	u8197	m556	MULDER	What kind of infection?
L580370	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Evidence of a massive infection.
L580369	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did you find?
L580368	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can't really talk right now.
L580367	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why are you whispering?
L580319	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
L580318	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
L580317	u8197	m556	MULDER	I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
L580316	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
L580315	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'd been told as much.
L580314	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
L580313	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
L580312	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
L580311	u8198	m556	SCULLY	And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
L580310	u8198	m556	SCULLY	There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
L580309	u8197	m556	MULDER	It's like jelly.
L580304	u8198	m556	SCULLY	And you're looking for?
L580303	u8197	m556	MULDER	According to this tag.
L580302	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
L580270	u8197	m556	MULDER	Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
L580269	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- what are you doing?
L580268	u8197	m556	MULDER	Get dressed, Scully.
L580267	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Go home, Mulder. It's late.
L580266	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is that what you'd like me to do?
L580265	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
L580264	u8197	m556	MULDER	What are you implying, Scully?
L580263	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
L580262	u8197	m556	MULDER	I was until about an hour ago.
L580261	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Are you drunk, Mulder?
L580260	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why not? It's three AM.
L580259	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No.
L580258	u8197	m556	MULDER	I wake you?
L580206	u8198	m556	SCULLY	There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
L580205	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're... quitting?
L580204	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
L580203	u8197	m556	MULDER	This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
L580202	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
L580201	u8197	m556	MULDER	They were the ones that put us together.
L580200	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
L580199	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why?
L580198	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
L580197	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What are you talking about?
L580196	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
L580195	u8197	m556	MULDER	They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
L580194	u8198	m556	SCULLY	All I told them was the truth.
L580193	u8197	m556	MULDER	Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
L580164	u8198	m556	SCULLY	-- Mulder! Get in the car!
L580163	u8197	m556	MULDER	Something's not right...
L580148	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
L580147	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully?
L580140	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
L580139	u8197	m556	MULDER	...thirteen fifty six...
L580138	u8197	m556	MULDER	Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
L580137	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
L580134	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Nice try, Mulder.
L580133	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully, get somebody to open this door.
L580131	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm in the vending room.
L580130	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where are you, Mulder?
L580129	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully, I found the bomb.
L580128	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Scully...
L580126	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something sweet.
L580125	u8197	m556	MULDER	Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
L580124	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I just did. You're buying.
L580123	u8197	m556	MULDER	Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
L580122	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
L580121	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Oh yeah. Had you big time.
L580120	u8197	m556	MULDER	No you didn't.
L580119	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Had you.
L580117	u8197	m556	MULDER	It's locked?
L580116	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Now what?
L580115	u8197	m556	MULDER	What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
L580114	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
L580113	u8197	m556	MULDER	How's that?
L580112	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
L580110	u8197	m556	MULDER	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
L580109	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Jesus, Mulder...
L580108	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to playing a hunch?
L580107	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder...?
L580106	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
L580105	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think they have that covered.
L580104	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
L580103	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're looking for a bomb.
L580102	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
L580101	u8197	m556	MULDER	What's wrong, Scully?
L580100	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No. I haven't.
L580099	u8197	m556	MULDER	Did you find something?
L580098	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I'm on the roof.
L580097	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where are you, Scully?
L580096	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- it's me --
L580300	u8197	m556	MULDER	Thank you.
L580299	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
L580297	u8197	m556	MULDER	They can patch you in through the switchboard.
L580296	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	I don't have his number.
L580295	u8197	m556	MULDER	Well, call General McAddie.
L580294	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	I don't know anything about that.
L580293	u8197	m556	MULDER	General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
L580292	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	General McAddie's.
L580291	u8197	m556	MULDER	On whose orders?
L580290	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
L580289	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're going to the morgue.
L580648	u8197	m556	MULDER	I've got to find Scully.
L580647	u8199	m556	SKINNER	What are you doing?
L580644	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I'm not taking any chances.
L580643	u8197	m556	MULDER	Are we being watched?
L580642	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I don't know.
L580641	u8197	m556	MULDER	How deep does this go?
L580640	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
L580639	u8197	m556	MULDER	Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
L580638	u8199	m556	SKINNER	She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
L580637	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where's Scully?!
L580636	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Mulder --
L580191	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
L580190	u8197	m556	MULDER	I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
L580189	u8199	m556	SKINNER	She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
L580188	u8197	m556	MULDER	-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
L580187	u8199	m556	SKINNER	-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
L580186	u8197	m556	MULDER	But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
L580185	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
L580184	u8197	m556	MULDER	And they want to blame us?
L580183	u8199	m556	SKINNER	You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
L580182	u8197	m556	MULDER	She was with me.
L580181	u8199	m556	SKINNER	-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
L580180	u8197	m556	MULDER	About what?
L580179	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
L580701	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My life is over.  Go.
L580700	u8197	m556	MULDER	What about you?
L580699	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
L580698	u8197	m556	MULDER	What alien environment?
L580697	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
L580696	u8197	m556	MULDER	How?
L580695	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
L580692	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Driver.
L580691	u8197	m556	MULDER	Let me out. Stop the car.
L580690	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
L580689	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where is he?
L580688	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
L580687	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to Kurtzweil?
L580686	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
L580685	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why are you telling me this?
L580684	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
L580683	u8197	m556	MULDER	But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
L580682	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
L580681	u8197	m556	MULDER	That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
L580680	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
L580679	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
L580678	u8197	m556	MULDER	What do you mean, walked?
L580677	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
L580676	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
L580675	u8197	m556	MULDER	This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
L580674	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
L580673	u8197	m556	MULDER	A virus?
L580672	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
L580671	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're lying.
L580670	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
L580669	u8197	m556	MULDER	What is it?
L580667	u8197	m556	MULDER	I want to know where Scully is.
L580666	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
L580665	u8197	m556	MULDER	About the conspiracy?
L580664	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
L580663	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Yes.
L580662	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is she alive?
L580661	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I have answers for you.
L580660	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where's Scully?
L580659	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	He's come and gone.
L580658	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to Kurtzweil?
L580657	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Mr. Mulder.
L580459	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
L580458	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	You need not kill a man to destroy him.
L580457	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
L580452	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	And Mulder?
L580451	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
L580450	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
L580443	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
L580442	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Our vaccine may have no effect!
L580439	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
L580438	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
L580437	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
L580436	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
L580435	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
L580432	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
L580431	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
L580430	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My god...
L580424	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
L580423	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	More concerns than that?
L580421	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
L580420	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
L582483	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Give a kiss to Edward.
L582482	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	...give a kiss to Edward.
L582481	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
L582480	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
L582479	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I know.
L582478	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I don't need them anymore...
L582477	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
L582401	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
L582400	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What's wrong?
L582399	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Damn him.
L582397	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Baked in a pie.
L582396	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Four and twenty blackbirds...
L582395	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	...a pocketful of rye.
L582189	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What happened?
L582188	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Is it cold in here?
L582158	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.  No.
L582157	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
L582149	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She said convincingly.
L582148	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I'll be fine.
L582147	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
L582137	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	He needs to be turned over.
L582136	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Like a New Year's Day hangover.
L582135	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
L582134	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
L582088	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why did we stop?
L582087	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Nothing.
L582086	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
L582085	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Sing a song of sixpence.
L581964	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	That's my girl.
L581963	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
L581962	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
L581961	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay.
L581960	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Don't bring it home in this.
L581959	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
L581958	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Yes mother.
L581957	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
L581956	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.
L581955	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
L581952	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay, okay...
L581951	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
L581950	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I'd be there for him.
L581949	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
L581948	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I do it all the time!
L581947	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
L581946	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
L581945	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
L581944	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
L581943	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Shush.
L581942	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Miriam...
L581940	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I don't want to find out.
L581939	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
L581938	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
L581936	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Someday you can.  We all believe that...
L581935	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	She thinks I can bring Edward back.
L581934	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She adores you.
L581932	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Lucien Baines?
L581931	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He hates me.
L581909	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
L581908	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.
L581907	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
L581906	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Did we go sailing?
L581903	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
L581902	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A pocketful of rye...
L581901	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Sing a song of sixpence...
L582517	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.  Thank you.
L582516	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No problem.
L582515	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Thank you.
L582514	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I got it.
L582513	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	They're hungry.
L582511	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
L582510	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It doesn't matter...
L582509	u8208	m557	NOVAK	He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
L582508	u8208	m557	NOVAK	All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
L582507	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He's mine?
L582506	u8208	m557	NOVAK	So you say.
L582505	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
L582504	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Well look at that.
L582503	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Good for them.
L582502	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Yep.  Eloped.
L582501	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I heard Julia and John got married.
L582500	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Absolutely.  Abigail...
L582499	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You sure about this?
L582498	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
L582497	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That went well.
L582372	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I can't leave him!
L582371	u8208	m557	NOVAK	COME ON!
L582365	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
L582364	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Where the hell are we?
L582359	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
L582358	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Little boy?!  That's him!
L582357	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
L582356	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"Like hell ""wait."""
L582355	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Wait...
L582256	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay, okay...
L582255	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
L582240	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Yes.  I am.
L582239	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You're sure of that?
L582238	u8208	m557	NOVAK	A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
L582235	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Tell me.
L582234	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What difference does it make...?
L582233	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What happened?
L582232	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What happened to Charles Gish?
L582231	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
L582230	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	If you believe that.
L582229	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Evil.
L582228	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Then what is he?
L582227	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like ""remorse."""
L582226	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
L582225	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
L582224	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
L582223	u8208	m557	NOVAK	This is Stargher we're talking about?
L582222	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
L582221	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You think you can do this, don't you?
L582220	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
L582219	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What about Julia?
L582218	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
L582217	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I did, yeah.
L582216	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
L582213	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
L582212	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You're the shrink, you tell me.
L582211	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why'd you bring him here?
L582210	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
L582209	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What did you see?
L582208	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	With Stargher I saw things...
L582206	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That's what therapists are for, right?
L582205	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
L582204	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
L582203	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
L582202	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Peter, okay?
L582201	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Agent Novak?
L582200	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
L582199	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
L582198	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What then?
L582197	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It doesn't have much to do with science.
L582196	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
L582195	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I""m here, isn't that right?"
L582194	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Do you think that's funny?
L582193	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
L582140	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I know him.
L582139	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You don't know the procedure.
L582138	u8208	m557	NOVAK	This man is deeply disturbed, he...
L582133	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How hard could it be...?
L582132	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I realize that...
L582131	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some ""troubled kid"" you're dealing with."
L582107	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
L582106	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
L582105	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
L582104	u8208	m557	NOVAK	There's always a chance they'll confess.
L582102	u8208	m557	NOVAK	As far as I needed.
L582101	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	"What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was ""normal?""  Conscious.  How far would you go?"
L581896	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I bet we can fix it.
L581895	u8205	m557	EDWARD	Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.
L581894	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Oh no... No you don't.
L581893	u8205	m557	EDWARD	Mocky-Lock.
L581892	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Who says?
L581891	u8205	m557	EDWARD	's broken.
L581890	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What now?
L581884	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He's beautiful...
L581883	u8205	m557	EDWARD	You liked him?
L582470	u8204	m557	COLE	I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
L582469	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You're kidding me.
L582468	u8204	m557	COLE	Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
L582467	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Delano?
L582466	u8204	m557	COLE	Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
L582385	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That hoist, with the winch...
L582384	u8204	m557	COLE	Already there.
L582383	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I need you to find something in the basement...
L582382	u8204	m557	COLE	Agent Cole.
L581973	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
L581972	u8204	m557	COLE	She the one from Santa Cruz?
L582417	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She's bringing Stargher into hers.
L582416	u8206	m557	HENRY	Instead of going into his mind...
L582412	u8206	m557	HENRY	It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
L582411	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What's wrong?
L582410	u8206	m557	HENRY	She changed the codes.
L582252	u8206	m557	HENRY	I think that's the whole point.
L582251	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
L582185	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
L582184	u8206	m557	HENRY	That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
L582163	u8206	m557	HENRY	Initiating connection.
L582162	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Intravenous administration complete.
L582161	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	"Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as ""receivers.""  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared."
L582160	u8206	m557	HENRY	Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
L582124	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
L582123	u8206	m557	HENRY	Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
L582493	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Completely unaware.
L582492	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What about the cat?
L582491	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Awaiting his arrival.
L582490	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How's the patient.
L582489	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
L582488	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	That's a secret.
L582487	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
L582486	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	You're looking well.
L582485	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Dr. Kent.
L582484	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Agent Novak.
L582380	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
L582379	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Is she alright?
L582330	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I doubt that.
L582329	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
L582328	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
L582327	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582326	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What about narcotics?
L582325	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582324	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Any psychiatric medication?
L582323	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Prevacid.  For my stomach.
L582322	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
L582321	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Absolutely.
L582320	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Nervous?
L582317	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582316	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
L582313	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes.
L582312	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Into Stargher.  Inside...
L582311	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	"That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's ""lost.""  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy."
L582310	u8208	m557	NOVAK	When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
L582192	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I'll get her...
L582191	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Catherine!
L582095	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
L582094	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What about the legalities of this...?
L582091	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Sometime yesterday morning.
L582090	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	When did he lapse into the coma?
L582014	u8208	m557	NOVAK	It's his dog.
L582013	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
L582002	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
L582001	u8208	m557	NOVAK	The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
L581998	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Now.
L581997	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Now?
L581996	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I need it.
L581995	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
L581994	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	So?
L581976	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
L581975	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Someone looking after her little girl?
L582394	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
L582393	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
L582392	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
L582390	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Considering where I've been...
L582389	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
L582244	u8208	m557	NOVAK	But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
L582243	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Next time, tell me, okay?
L582242	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Right here.
L582120	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
L582119	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say ""It was all his idea."""
L582118	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
L582117	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I don't have to.
L582116	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
L582115	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What else do we do?!
L582114	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You sure you want to go through with this?
L582078	u8208	m557	NOVAK	They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
L582077	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
L582043	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.  Can you get a man close?
L582042	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
L582041	u8208	m557	NOVAK	We proceed assuming she is.
L582031	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	"She remembers because it was her ""dream truck.""  Wanted one just like it."
L582030	u8208	m557	NOVAK	After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
L582012	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
L582011	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
L581988	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
L581987	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Here he is.
L581986	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
L581985	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How is she?
L594738	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	You get your money from your husband.
L594737	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	What about me?
L594736	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	"This is for ""mama and the kids."""
L594727	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
L594726	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
L594725	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	I don't know ?-
L594724	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Is he in love with you?
L594723	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Nice fellow?
L594722	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Mmm???yes.
L594721	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Good looking?
L594720	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
L594719	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
L594718	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and ?-
L594717	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Why not -- if you like it ?- if that's what you really want.
L594716	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
L594715	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
L594714	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	That depends. How much money has he?
L594713	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	My son?in?law. What do you think of him?
L594703	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Why not?
L594702	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
L594794	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
L594793	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
L594792	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
L594665	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
L594664	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I don't know.
L594663	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
L594662	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I sleep it off.
L594661	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Then what do you do?
L594660	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	And when you drink, you get drunk.
L594659	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I drink.
L594658	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
L594643	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
L594642	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
L594641	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
L594636	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	It don't look like a leopard to me.
L594635	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
L594875	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's the place: I remember -? My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
L594874	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
L594873	u8285	m563	JERRY	What arroyo -? how did you get to it ??
L594872	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head ?- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ??
L594871	u8285	m563	JERRY	Where? Where did you find it?
L594870	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	What's left of him.
L594869	u8285	m563	JERRY	You found the leopard!
L594868	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
L594679	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
L594678	u8285	m563	JERRY	Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
L594677	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I want him to lock me up.
L594676	u8285	m563	JERRY	What do you want to see him for?
L594675	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I don't know. I want to see Robles.
L594674	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
L594673	u8285	m563	JERRY	Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
L594672	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I'm sick.
L594667	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
L594666	u8285	m563	JERRY	Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
L594657	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. I'm serious about this.
L594656	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Sure!
L594640	u8285	m563	JERRY	But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
L594639	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Sure, I like my leopards
L594625	u8285	m563	JERRY	Up at the museum.
L594624	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Where's that man?
L594623	u8285	m563	JERRY	Let's get in your truck.
L594622	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Sure.
L594621	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
L594620	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	They don't say it to me.
L594619	u8285	m563	JERRY	They all say the cat killed this second girl.
L594618	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
L594617	u8285	m563	JERRY	You really think so, Charlie?
L594616	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
L594615	u8285	m563	JERRY	Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
L594614	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
L594759	u8287	m563	MARIA	Tomorrow -?
L594758	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	See you tomorrow ?-
L594755	u8287	m563	MARIA	Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
L594754	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	The death card - -
L594753	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Let me see it ??
L594752	u8287	m563	MARIA	Don't look at it!
L594751	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Go on -?
L594750	u8287	m563	MARIA	Something black ?- something on its way to you ??
L594748	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	What are you doing that for?
L594747	u8287	m563	MARIA	Cut.
L594742	u8287	m563	MARIA	The elderly man I told you about.
L594741	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Who?
L594740	u8287	m563	MARIA	Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
L594469	u8287	m563	MARIA	Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
L594468	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
L594467	u8287	m563	MARIA	You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
L594466	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	What did they say before the bad card came up?
L594464	u8287	m563	MARIA	All men are fools. They like to make a big show -? shout and hunt --
L594463	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
L594462	u8287	m563	MARIA	) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
L594461	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
L594460	u8287	m563	MARIA	It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -? not the card of four?footed things.
L594559	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too ?? when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret ?? a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
L594558	u8289	m563	ROSITA	Love is different for different people.
L594556	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
L594555	u8289	m563	ROSITA	What, senorita?
L594554	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	Rosita ?? I have wondered -?
L594553	u8289	m563	ROSITA	Pedro is waiting for me, too.
L594539	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	At four. He will be there at four.
L594538	u8289	m563	ROSITA	You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
L594537	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	He will be waiting...
L594811	u8283	m563	ELOISE	I'll miss you too, honey --
L594810	u8286	m563	KIKI	Hey ?? I'm over here.
L594809	u8283	m563	ELOISE	Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ??
L594374	u8286	m563	KIKI	"I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it ""fits just perfect."""
L594373	u8283	m563	ELOISE	And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
L594342	u8286	m563	KIKI	I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
L594341	u8283	m563	ELOISE	I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
L594339	u8286	m563	KIKI	Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
L594338	u8283	m563	ELOISE	You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
L594337	u8286	m563	KIKI	Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ??
L594336	u8283	m563	ELOISE	You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
L594335	u8286	m563	KIKI	Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -? He'll come up with something.
L594334	u8283	m563	ELOISE	She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
L594333	u8286	m563	KIKI	It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click ? click ? click.
L594908	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
L594907	u8283	m563	ELOISE	Oh, that's so interesting!
L594906	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths ?? that's what this procession is supposed to be.
L594905	u8283	m563	ELOISE	You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life ?- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
L594904	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Good evening.
L594903	u8283	m563	ELOISE	Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
L594941	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
L594940	u8285	m563	JERRY	Then you found the leopard --
L594939	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I couldn't rest ?- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
L594938	u8285	m563	JERRY	Tormented -- ? Why?
L594936	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
L594935	u8285	m563	JERRY	Tell me.
L594934	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It's better you don't know.
L594933	u8285	m563	JERRY	Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
L594932	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
L594931	u8285	m563	JERRY	You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
L594930	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Not! I tell you. No!
L594929	u8285	m563	JERRY	It was you.
L594928	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	No.
L594927	u8285	m563	JERRY	It was you, Galbraith!
L594807	u8285	m563	JERRY	You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ??  Don't you?
L594806	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
L594805	u8285	m563	JERRY	Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
L594804	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
L594803	u8285	m563	JERRY	I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
L594802	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	To the eye? Like other men.
L594801	u8285	m563	JERRY	If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
L594800	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
L594799	u8285	m563	JERRY	All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
L594798	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
L594797	u8285	m563	JERRY	You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
L594796	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Just barely possible - - yes.
L594795	u8285	m563	JERRY	You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
L594671	u8285	m563	JERRY	Some other time.
L594670	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
L594669	u8285	m563	JERRY	Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
L594655	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -? eh?
L594654	u8285	m563	JERRY	I don't know.
L594653	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Yes, but what sort of a man?
L594652	u8285	m563	JERRY	A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
L594651	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
L594649	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
L594648	u8285	m563	JERRY	Some crazy guy.
L594647	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
L594646	u8285	m563	JERRY	There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
L594645	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
L594644	u8285	m563	JERRY	It could be a man.
L594638	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Charlie likes his leopard.
L594637	u8285	m563	JERRY	Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
L594634	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yes.
L594633	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	About Charlie's leopard?
L594632	u8285	m563	JERRY	Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
L594631	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
L594630	u8285	m563	JERRY	More or less.
L594629	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Come to look around?
L594628	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	We're old friends.
L594627	u8285	m563	JERRY	You know Charlie How-Come?
L594610	u8285	m563	JERRY	I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
L594609	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
L594604	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
L594603	u8285	m563	JERRY	But it doesn't eat what it kills.
L594602	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
L594601	u8285	m563	JERRY	Why?
L594600	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
L594599	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
L594598	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Sure -- certainly ?- but what's that got to do with this?
L594597	u8285	m563	JERRY	It doesn't jibe with this ?? you told me the leopard would go out into the country ?- it wouldn't stay in the city ??
L594596	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Yes?
L594595	u8285	m563	JERRY	Doc -- something you said the other day --
L594513	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
L594512	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's right, of course.
L594511	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
L594510	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	No. I'm quite sure.
L594509	u8285	m563	JERRY	You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
L594508	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
L594507	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
L594506	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	You're worrying about its killing someone else?
L594505	u8285	m563	JERRY	It's about the leopard.
L594504	u8285	m563	JERRY	I want to ask you something.
L594503	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Well, I'd best be off.
L594494	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	"Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in ""Zaza."" After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out."
L594493	u8285	m563	JERRY	Show business?
L594923	u8286	m563	KIKI	No ?- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -? turn off the lights ??
L594922	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Wait ??
L594916	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	They do, but -- there are no lights out there ?- they'll just be shadows -?
L594915	u8286	m563	KIKI	I thought they came right past here ??
L594914	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
L594911	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ??
L594502	u8286	m563	KIKI	Thanks.
L594501	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
L594500	u8286	m563	KIKI	Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
L594498	u8286	m563	KIKI	That was a calamity!
L594497	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	That was unfortunate.
L594496	u8286	m563	KIKI	Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter ?whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
L594495	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
L594492	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith ? teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
L594491	u8286	m563	KIKI	Why did you give up teaching?
L594490	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
L594489	u8286	m563	KIKI	What do you do now?
L594488	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	To know where that leopard went - ? I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh?water college back East. I gave that up.
L594487	u8286	m563	KIKI	Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
L594888	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money ? not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
L594887	u8285	m563	JERRY	You won't go to Galbraith with me?
L594886	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
L594885	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's a fact, isn't it?
L594884	u8288	m563	ROBLES	I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
L594883	u8285	m563	JERRY	Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ??
L594881	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'm sure of it!
L594880	u8288	m563	ROBLES	You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
L594879	u8285	m563	JERRY	Chief, don't you understand what this means?
L594789	u8285	m563	JERRY	Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
L594788	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Why?
L594787	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yes. The lipstick.
L594783	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
L594782	u8285	m563	JERRY	State hunters?
L594685	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. He was kidding Charlie.
L594684	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
L594683	u8285	m563	JERRY	I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
L594612	u8285	m563	JERRY	Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
L594611	u8288	m563	ROBLES	What are you getting at?
L594608	u8285	m563	JERRY	I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
L594607	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
L594606	u8285	m563	JERRY	Something's wrong with this whole setup --
L594605	u8288	m563	ROBLES	That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
L594450	u8285	m563	JERRY	It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
L594449	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Go on foot.
L594448	u8285	m563	JERRY	I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
L594445	u8285	m563	JERRY	Thanks, Sheriff.
L594444	u8288	m563	ROBLES	You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
L594954	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
L594953	u8286	m563	KIKI	It's a lovely town ?- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
L594951	u8285	m563	JERRY	We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
L594950	u8286	m563	KIKI	Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -? where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
L594949	u8285	m563	JERRY	"I know. What do you think I felt when you said, ""don't be soft?"""
L594948	u8286	m563	KIKI	I hated you that day ?- you and your flip talk -? with that little girl lying dead.
L594947	u8285	m563	JERRY	I know -- Teresa -?
L594946	u8286	m563	KIKI	We stood here once before.
L594926	u8286	m563	KIKI	It's all right. I'm not hurt.
L594925	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki?
L594890	u8286	m563	KIKI	We will ??
L594889	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
L594863	u8286	m563	KIKI	How do you know?
L594862	u8285	m563	JERRY	Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
L594861	u8286	m563	KIKI	All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways ?
L594860	u8285	m563	JERRY	Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
L594859	u8286	m563	KIKI	I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
L594858	u8285	m563	JERRY	What! You can't be --
L594857	u8286	m563	KIKI	As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
L594856	u8286	m563	KIKI	That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
L594855	u8285	m563	JERRY	I got into a little crap game.
L594854	u8286	m563	KIKI	Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
L594853	u8285	m563	JERRY	Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
L594852	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
L594851	u8286	m563	KIKI	You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
L594848	u8285	m563	JERRY	Absolutely sure.
L594847	u8286	m563	KIKI	You're positive of that, aren't you?
L594846	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
L594845	u8285	m563	JERRY	If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
L594844	u8286	m563	KIKI	Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
L594842	u8286	m563	KIKI	Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
L594841	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
L594840	u8286	m563	KIKI	You. Us.
L594839	u8285	m563	JERRY	What else do you care about, Kicks?
L594837	u8285	m563	JERRY	That doesn't make sense.
L594836	u8286	m563	KIKI	Maybe I want to feel badly.
L594835	u8285	m563	JERRY	Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
L594832	u8285	m563	JERRY	Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
L594831	u8286	m563	KIKI	And she waited here for him?
L594830	u8286	m563	KIKI	Yes. Do you mind?
L594829	u8285	m563	JERRY	You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
L594828	u8286	m563	KIKI	Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ??
L594826	u8286	m563	KIKI	Yes.
L594825	u8285	m563	JERRY	I know. Funerals.
L594824	u8286	m563	KIKI	Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
L594823	u8285	m563	JERRY	He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
L594822	u8286	m563	KIKI	That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
L594816	u8285	m563	JERRY	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
L594815	u8286	m563	KIKI	I can use them.
L594486	u8286	m563	KIKI	And not a sign of the leopard?
L594483	u8285	m563	JERRY	You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
L594482	u8286	m563	KIKI	Who is he?
L594481	u8285	m563	JERRY	Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
L594480	u8286	m563	KIKI	Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
L594479	u8285	m563	JERRY	The whole town's in a state, Kiki ??doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ??nobody on the streets at night ??
L594478	u8286	m563	KIKI	It must be the altitude ?? you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot?and?saddle boys --
L594477	u8286	m563	KIKI	And did you find the leopard?
L594476	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yeah.
L594475	u8286	m563	KIKI	Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft?soap twenty editors!
L594456	u8285	m563	JERRY	We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
L594455	u8286	m563	KIKI	What did he have to do -? look at the body?
L594454	u8285	m563	JERRY	I don't know ?? a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
L594453	u8286	m563	KIKI	Who was the other man?
L594452	u8286	m563	KIKI	And I suppose you don't feel bad!
L594451	u8285	m563	JERRY	I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
L594442	u8286	m563	KIKI	Don't be soft.
L594441	u8285	m563	JERRY	Suppose I slip them a few bucks ? for the funeral expenses.
L594379	u8286	m563	KIKI	Now look what you've done.
L594378	u8285	m563	JERRY	Are you all right?
L594376	u8286	m563	KIKI	The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
L594375	u8285	m563	JERRY	You look swell in that three?alarm number --
L594371	u8285	m563	JERRY	I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
L594370	u8286	m563	KIKI	Clo-Clo?
L594369	u8285	m563	JERRY	And I never will -- you know what's between us -? we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
L594368	u8286	m563	KIKI	No ?? not yet.
L594367	u8285	m563	JERRY	Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
L594366	u8286	m563	KIKI	This is l939. Can't you subtract?
L594365	u8285	m563	JERRY	Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
L594364	u8286	m563	KIKI	You're too good to me.
L594363	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
L594362	u8286	m563	KIKI	On his back, I suppose.
L594361	u8285	m563	JERRY	I thought -? is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
L594360	u8286	m563	KIKI	That's easy. Me.
L594359	u8285	m563	JERRY	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
L594358	u8286	m563	KIKI	Makes no difference.  Get him out.
L594357	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
L594356	u8286	m563	KIKI	Get it out of here!
L594355	u8285	m563	JERRY	And I never will- you know what's between us ? we're a thing But this is serious competition.
L594354	u8286	m563	KIKI	No ?- not yet.

L594352	u8286	m563	KIKI	You're too good to me.
L594351	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
L594350	u8286	m563	KIKI	On his back, I suppose.
L594349	u8285	m563	JERRY	I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ??walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
L594348	u8286	m563	KIKI	That's easy. Me.
L594347	u8285	m563	JERRY	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
L594346	u8286	m563	KIKI	Makes no difference. Get him out!
L594345	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
L594344	u8286	m563	KIKI	Get it out of here!

L646105	u8846	m600	CHINA	Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
L646104	u8855	m600	SARAH	He did?
L646103	u8846	m600	CHINA	Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?

L646173	u8851	m600	MARK	Suffer?  We're living in America.

L646321	u8847	m600	INSPECTOR ROBERTS	Yes, I guess you're right
L646320	u8847	m600	INSPECTOR ROBERTS	It's all rather morbid though isn't it?

L646343	u8851	m600	MARK	Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
L646342	u8855	m600	SARAH	Well?
L646340	u8855	m600	SARAH	Who's is all this?
L646339	u8851	m600	MARK	If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
L646334	u8855	m600	SARAH	Big deal!
L646333	u8851	m600	MARK	You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.

L646298	u8855	m600	SARAH	That's not what you said last night.
L646297	u8851	m600	MARK	No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.

L646263	u8855	m600	SARAH	I know what you mean.
L646262	u8851	m600	MARK	Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
L646261	u8855	m600	SARAH	Then why do you still like her?
L646254	u8851	m600	MARK	I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
L646253	u8855	m600	SARAH	Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
L646252	u8851	m600	MARK	What?  Tony and China, together?
L646251	u8855	m600	SARAH	Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
L646247	u8855	m600	SARAH	I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
L646246	u8851	m600	MARK	Haven't we been doing our homework.
L646204	u8857	m600	TONY	This. is killer.
L646203	u8851	m600	MARK	Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
L646202	u8857	m600	TONY	This time I really don't see anyone man.
L646190	u8857	m600	TONY	Right behind you.
L646189	u8851	m600	MARK	Anyone else not coming?
L646183	u8851	m600	MARK	Right.
L646182	u8857	m600	TONY	Safety in numbers man.
L646181	u8851	m600	MARK	Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
L646138	u8857	m600	TONY	Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
L646137	u8851	m600	MARK	I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
L646376	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	Maybe before the event, never after.
L646375	u8851	m600	MARK	Can this be stopped?
L646374	u8851	m600	MARK	Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
L646373	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.

L646371	u8851	m600	MARK	Sell my soul?
L646370	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
L646368	u8851	m600	MARK	Six six and six
L646367	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	Well divide 18 into three
L646366	u8851	m600	MARK	Well?
L646362	u8851	m600	MARK	Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
L646361	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	So Mark, what's so urgent?
L646360	u8851	m600	MARK	No thank you sir we're fine.

L648531	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648530	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	No.  But once I heard...
L648529	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Did you?
L648528	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	A ghost?
L648527	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I started seeing things.
L648526	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	What do you mean?
L648525	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
L648524	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	So much.
L648523	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I miss you.
L648522	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.

L648514	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Besides, Dad would have freaked.
L648512	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why?
L648511	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
L648510	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That was very good.

L647961	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes?
L647960	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Hey.
L647959	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Do you have a scarf?
L648459	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	"No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of ""empty-nest"" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist."
L648458	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	That can't feel good.
L648457	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
L648456	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	What?
L648452	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
L648451	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	You were in an accident?
L648450	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
L648449	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Have you been hurt?

L648447	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	What do you think?  Guess.
L648446	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.
L648445	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Do you?
L648444	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	"She said, ""You know.""  That I know."
L648442	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
L648441	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	You're saying you willed these events to happen?
L648440	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
L648439	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	You think you influenced her?
L648438	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Isn't there something called group hysteria?
L648437	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Your friend saw them.
L648436	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes, but...
L648435	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
L648434	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Well, that's what we're here for.
L648433	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What's happening to me?
L648361	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
L648360	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	How?
L648359	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Nope.
L648358	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Are you humoring me?
L648357	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
L648356	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You think that'll help?
L648355	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Try to communicate with her somehow.
L648354	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648352	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What do you think I should do?
L648351	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Fine.
L648350	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
L648349	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Do you have any idea who she is?
L648348	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Pretty.  She's a blond.
L648347	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	What does she look like?
L648346	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
L648345	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	How do you know it's a she?
L648344	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
L648342	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Mm-hmm.
L648341	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	These are good.
L648336	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're joking.
L648335	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Fireball?
L648334	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
L648333	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Why is he worried?
L648332	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.
L648331	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Do you really think so?
L648330	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
L648329	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Your husband?
L648328	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Because he was worried about me.
L648327	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Then why did you?
L648326	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I didn't want to come.
L648325	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
L648324	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Who's idea was it?
L648582	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	The wives.
L648581	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Who's that?
L648580	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
L648579	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
L648578	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Toward the end.  You remember?
L648577	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	At the party.
L648576	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
L648575	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
L648574	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
L648573	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
L648572	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Uh-huh.  What can be?
L648571	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	I know how hard it can be sometimes.

L648187	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
L648186	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
L648185	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...
L648184	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	Yes?
L648484	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
L648483	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  No, I don't.
L648482	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	You must think I'm pathetic.
L648481	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
L648480	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...sure.
L648479	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
L648478	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648477	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Love.
L648475	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
L648474	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
L648473	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	No.
L648470	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.

L648465	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Right.  I'm sorry.
L648464	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	And then you weren't there.
L648463	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
L648462	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You do?
L648461	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I wanted to apologize.

L648037	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's not...It's not like that.
L648036	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
L648035	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tell me.  I can help you.
L648034	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
L648033	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tell me.  Please.
L648032	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I can't, no, no, I can't...
L648031	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?  What are you afraid of?
L648030	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
L648029	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Who?  Your husband?
L648028	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
L648027	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I'm not...
L648026	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hello?
L648025	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Is everything alright?
L648024	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I've seen you.  From the window.
L648023	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...yes.
L648022	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	You're the flower lady.
L648021	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
L648020	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Who are you?
L648659	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
L648658	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What was her major?
L648657	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of course.
L648656	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
L648655	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I should be going anyway.
L648654	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	They're calling me in to work.
L648651	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You must have been very proud.
L648650	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
L648648	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
L648647	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.
L648646	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Why are you here?
L648644	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
L648643	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She never mentioned her father.
L648642	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
L648641	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
L648640	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	You look a little old for a student.
L648639	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's fine.
L648638	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
L648635	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	She never mentioned you.
L648634	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Claire.
L648633	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	What's your name?
L648630	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Please leave me alone.
L648629	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, I don't.
L648628	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	You know where she is?
L648627	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
L648626	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Yeah.
L648625	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mrs. Frank?
L648305	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
L648304	u8861	m601	ELENA	She got it.  Turned it down.
L648302	u8861	m601	ELENA	I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
L648301	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She's making this up.
L648300	u8861	m601	ELENA	And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
L648299	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Do we have to?
L648298	u8861	m601	ELENA	We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
L648297	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Stop.
L648296	u8861	m601	ELENA	You should have heard her play.
L648293	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh God...
L648292	u8861	m601	ELENA	And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
L648291	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We were suite mates.
L648290	u8861	m601	ELENA	I came in from my room...
L648289	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He was so pissed.
L648288	u8861	m601	ELENA	...just so she could cut them off.
L648287	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I didn't sleep with him.
L648286	u8861	m601	ELENA	Anyway, Claire slept with him...
L648285	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He looked like one of the Monkees.
L648282	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We know each other.
L648281	u8861	m601	ELENA	This is...
L648280	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wow.
L648805	u8862	m601	JODY	Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
L648804	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know...
L648803	u8862	m601	JODY	You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
L648802	u8862	m601	JODY	He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
L648801	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I guess not.
L648800	u8862	m601	JODY	What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
L648799	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody he was lying.
L648798	u8862	m601	JODY	Did he say that?
L648797	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
L648770	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What is it?
L648769	u8862	m601	JODY	I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
L648768	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Like what?
L648767	u8862	m601	JODY	Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
L648766	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
L648765	u8862	m601	JODY	We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
L648764	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I can't believe this is happening.
L648763	u8862	m601	JODY	I know.
L648762	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, she tried to kill him.
L648750	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
L648749	u8862	m601	JODY	You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
L648748	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
L648747	u8862	m601	JODY	If she was dangerous before--
L648746	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.
L648745	u8862	m601	JODY	What are you going to do?
L648744	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
L648743	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.
L648742	u8862	m601	JODY	I'm a terrible friend.
L648741	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	All of us.
L648740	u8862	m601	JODY	I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
L648739	u8862	m601	JODY	Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
L648738	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
L648737	u8862	m601	JODY	By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
L648736	u8862	m601	JODY	I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
L648735	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Relieved?
L648734	u8862	m601	JODY	Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
L648733	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why?
L648732	u8862	m601	JODY	I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
L648731	u8862	m601	JODY	Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
L648730	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Adamant?
L648729	u8862	m601	JODY	I was down in Adamant...
L648728	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh God...you knew.
L648564	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
L648563	u8862	m601	JODY	Okay.  Okay.
L648562	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Please.
L648561	u8862	m601	JODY	But Claire--
L648560	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
L648559	u8862	m601	JODY	And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
L648558	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hartford?
L648557	u8862	m601	JODY	Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
L648556	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Did I?
L648555	u8862	m601	JODY	Something was there.  You saw it.
L648554	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
L648553	u8862	m601	JODY	Then what was it?
L648552	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
L648551	u8862	m601	JODY	What?
L648550	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, she's alive.
L648549	u8862	m601	JODY	Does Norman know?
L648548	u8862	m601	JODY	I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
L648547	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's alright.
L648546	u8862	m601	JODY	I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
L648545	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I think so
L648544	u8862	m601	JODY	Are you okay?
L648389	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, wait.
L648388	u8862	m601	JODY	I have to go.
L648383	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
L648382	u8862	m601	JODY	Mef?  What's Mef?
L648381	u8862	m601	JODY	M-E...
L648380	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh...
L648375	u8862	m601	JODY	Shhh.
L648374	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing's happening.
L648371	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.
L648370	u8862	m601	JODY	We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
L648369	u8862	m601	JODY	This.
L648368	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	The planchette?
L648367	u8862	m601	JODY	Place your fingers on the planchette.
L648364	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
L648363	u8862	m601	JODY	Sit down here.
L648218	u8862	m601	JODY	No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
L648217	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wow.  I'm losing it.
L648215	u8862	m601	JODY	I don't...
L648214	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	In the window.  Norman's at work.
L648213	u8862	m601	JODY	What?
L648212	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Someone's there.
L648209	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Please.  That's all I need.
L648208	u8862	m601	JODY	Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
L648207	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...no...no...no...
L648206	u8862	m601	JODY	Telling you...
L648205	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, no...
L648204	u8862	m601	JODY	Seance.
L648203	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648202	u8862	m601	JODY	Know what I think?
L648199	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
L648198	u8862	m601	JODY	You think he killed her?
L648101	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You got it.
L648100	u8862	m601	JODY	Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
L648099	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Absolutely.
L648098	u8862	m601	JODY	Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
L648097	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's niiice.
L648096	u8862	m601	JODY	Yep.
L648095	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh my god.  You bought it.
L648094	u8862	m601	JODY	So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
L648093	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Thanks, but I'm fine.
L648092	u8862	m601	JODY	She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
L648091	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're discussing me with your psychic?
L648090	u8862	m601	JODY	It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
L648089	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody--
L648088	u8862	m601	JODY	Kambucha mushroom tea...
L648087	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What is it?
L648086	u8862	m601	JODY	Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
L648085	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
L648084	u8862	m601	JODY	Well good.  So you're human.
L648083	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Okay, I'm a little tender.
L648082	u8862	m601	JODY	Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
L648081	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why does everyone find that so surprising?
L648080	u8862	m601	JODY	You are?
L648079	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Good.  I'm good.
L648078	u8862	m601	JODY	How you holding up?
L648842	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	MADISON!
L648841	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648840	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mauduh...
L648839	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Shhhh.
L648838	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mmmuh...
L648821	u8867	m601	NORMAN	IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
L648820	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't believe you.
L648819	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
L648818	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
L648817	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
L648816	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
L648811	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
L648810	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I know.
L648809	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You don't have to do that.
L648808	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm cooking you dinner.
L648807	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing.
L648806	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What's that for?
L648795	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
L648794	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Don't think so.
L648793	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Do you know it?
L648792	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Huh.
L648791	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
L648790	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648789	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Adamant.
L648788	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
L648787	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Look for antiques...
L648786	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
L648785	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	The leaves...
L648781	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire...
L648780	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
L648779	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How can you be sure?
L648778	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She can't be here without me.
L648777	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648776	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She's gone.
L648775	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
L648774	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's alright.
L648773	u8867	m601	NORMAN	We have to get out of here.
L648723	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
L648722	u8867	m601	NORMAN	We don't know that for sure.
L648721	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She did it.
L648718	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	How did she know where it was?
L648717	u8867	m601	NORMAN	She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
L648711	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Get out of my way.
L648710	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire...
L648709	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You should have tried harder.
L648708	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I tried to break it off!
L648707	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm not going to listen to this.
L648706	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
L648705	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Stop...
L648704	u8867	m601	NORMAN	And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
L648703	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Leave her out of this!
L648702	u8867	m601	NORMAN	To Caitlin!!
L648701	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Who?
L648700	u8867	m601	NORMAN	THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
L648699	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
L648698	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I never asked you to quit!
L648697	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
L648696	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, please don't...
L648693	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
L648692	u8867	m601	NORMAN	That's not what I'm sayi--
L648691	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	So you fucked a student?!
L648690	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It was last year.  We were having troubles.
L648689	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
L648688	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Oh God...
L648687	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
L648686	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire--
L648685	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I was there.
L648684	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648683	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You know...
L648681	u8867	m601	NORMAN	STOP IT!
L648680	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Your wife...
L648679	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Who?
L648678	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I think she's starting to suspect something.
L648677	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
L648676	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I don't like this, this...
L648675	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Since when?
L648674	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's too rough.
L648673	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What's the matter?
L648672	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Ow!
L648669	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wouldn't go that far.
L648668	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I take it your not mad at me.
L648619	u8867	m601	NORMAN	STOP IT!
L648618	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's Madison Fra--
L648617	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...Please stop...
L648616	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...I'm positive this time...
L648615	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Stop...
L648614	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
L648613	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes.  The ghost.
L648612	u8867	m601	NORMAN	The...
L648611	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
L648610	u8867	m601	NORMAN	No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
L648609	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Not personally.
L648608	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I may have seen her on campus.
L648596	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What's wrong with me?
L648595	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
L648594	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But I don't remember.
L648593	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
L648592	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
L648591	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
L648590	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	In the living room...
L648589	u8867	m601	NORMAN	A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
L648588	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I...
L648587	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You dropped a glass.
L648586	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
L648585	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You don't remember?
L648500	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You told me that I was...
L648499	u8867	m601	NORMAN	We walked all night...
L648498	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I felt you...looking through me...
L648497	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
L648496	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
L648495	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You know I am.
L648494	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Are you glad?  I'm glad.
L648493	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648491	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Call ya later.
L648490	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yep.
L648489	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Do I have everything?
L648488	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Really big bed.
L648487	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
L648486	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
L648430	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Then where is she?
L648429	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm sorry...
L648420	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, please...
L648419	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
L648418	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I will NOT.
L648417	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Keep your voice down.
L648414	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
L648413	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Sweetheart--
L648412	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
L648411	u8867	m601	NORMAN	But then you've been so much better...
L648410	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	The accident...?
L648409	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
L648408	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Sabotage?
L648407	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
L648406	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What are you...?  No.
L648405	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
L648404	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648402	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
L648401	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How did you--
L648400	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
L648399	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Who did?
L648398	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We had a seance.
L648397	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How do you know this?
L648396	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
L648395	u8867	m601	NORMAN	This is the Feur thing?
L648394	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
L648393	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What are you doing out here?
L648323	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
L648322	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Are you lonely?
L648321	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
L648320	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I never said...
L648319	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	"I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some ""symptom"" of something..."
L648318	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
L648315	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What can it hurt to talk to someone?
L648314	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman...
L648313	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Harvey says he's amazing.
L648312	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't need a shrink.
L648272	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Well, that's a relief.
L648271	u8867	m601	NORMAN	There we go.
L648270	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We're going to be fine.
L648269	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
L648268	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're not at the center.
L648267	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Five minutes?
L648266	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
L648265	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What are you doing?
L648264	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
L648263	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...like it never even happened...
L648262	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...Don't get all...
L648261	u8867	m601	NORMAN	When you do this, I swear...
L648259	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
L648258	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tonight?
L648257	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
L648256	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh.
L648255	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
L648254	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	When?
L648253	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
L648252	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Dressed?
L648251	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
L648250	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
L648249	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
L648248	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe.  Point is...not me.
L648247	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
L648246	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I didn't do that.
L648245	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What am I looking at?
L648244	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	See?
L648243	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
L648242	u8867	m601	NORMAN	She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
L648241	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Where is she then?
L648236	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's a ghost.
L648235	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
L648234	u8867	m601	NORMAN	From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
L648233	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	A flare?
L648232	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's a flare.
L648231	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  Look!  In the window.
L648230	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Our house.
L648229	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
L648228	u8867	m601	NORMAN	And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
L648227	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
L648226	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648225	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He killed her.
L648223	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Shhhh.
L648222	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What's going on, Claire?
L648221	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Get down!  He'll see.
L648178	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Huh.
L648177	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
L648176	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Did you call about the Feurs?
L648175	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Sorry.  You understand.
L648172	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
L648171	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You didn't?
L648170	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?  No.  No.
L648169	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did you tell her?
L648168	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
L648167	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
L648166	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm so sorry.
L648165	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...for my father.
L648164	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's...
L648163	u8867	m601	NORMAN	"...of Perpetual Distances.  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  ""I'm afraid you've mistaken me,""  I say..."
L648162	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh, no...
L648161	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...especially Spencer's Theorem...
L648160	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Well, that's nice.
L648159	u8867	m601	NORMAN	"And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, ""Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."""
L648158	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wow.
L648157	u8867	m601	NORMAN	He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
L648156	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're kidding.
L648155	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
L648154	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You know what that does to me.
L648153	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
L648152	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Yep.
L648151	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You are so brilliant.
L648150	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I think so.  Maybe.
L648149	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Really?
L648148	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Think I may have cracked it.
L648147	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
L648146	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
L648141	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.  Just...whispering.
L648140	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What kind of whispering?
L648139	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
L648138	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Of course.
L648137	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
L648136	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did you call the police?
L648135	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	In the house.  I was scared.
L648134	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What do you mean?  Some noises where?
L648133	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
L648132	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What are you doing here?
L648113	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
L648112	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire?
L648110	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, no.  It's fine.
L648109	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Unless you need me to come home...
L648108	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh.
L648107	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
L648106	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hi.
L648075	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Is it gone?
L648074	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
L648071	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hurry...
L648070	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Mmnph.
L648069	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman, you have to look at this!
L648066	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Promise?
L648065	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
L648064	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I just wish you could have heard her.
L648063	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's what I've been working for.
L648062	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I know.
L648061	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
L648060	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'd never be able to live with mysel--
L648059	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire...
L648058	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But what if something happens?
L648057	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
L648056	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's not what I'm sug--
L648055	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
L648054	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	To make sure she's all right.
L648053	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Why?
L648052	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
L648051	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Remember how we were?
L648050	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
L648049	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
L648048	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	More or less.
L648047	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did she say that?
L648046	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of him I think.
L648045	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Of what?
L648014	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'll be there.
L648013	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	After that.
L648012	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
L648011	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tomorrow.
L648010	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Maybe we should just...
L648009	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mmm.
L648008	u8867	m601	NORMAN	And we moved out here for the quiet.
L648004	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Shhh.
L648003	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did you...
L648002	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yup.
L648001	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Wanna fool around?
L648000	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nope.
L647999	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Tired?
L647998	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I know.
L647997	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's just us now.
L647996	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We did.
