L30091	u255	m16	MOZART	What do you mean?
L30090	u243	m16	ARCO	His Grace is very angry with you.
L30089	u255	m16	MOZART	These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
L30088	u243	m16	ARCO	Indeed.
L30087	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
L30086	u255	m16	MOZART	Certainly!
L30085	u243	m16	ARCO	Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
L30321	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Meaning you didn't like it.
L30320	u260	m16	SALIERI	Extremely clever.
L30319	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	What did you think of the music?
L30318	u260	m16	SALIERI	You were sublime.
L30317	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	How was I? Tell me honestly.
L30316	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
L30315	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, what does it matter to you?
L30314	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	The marriage!
L30313	u260	m16	SALIERI	What?
L30312	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Did you know? Had you heard?
L30251	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
L30250	u260	m16	SALIERI	Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
L30249	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Why?
L30248	u260	m16	SALIERI	You might be disappointed.
L30247	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	What does he look like?
L30246	u260	m16	SALIERI	Perhaps.
L30245	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
L30244	u260	m16	SALIERI	My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
L30243	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
L30242	u260	m16	SALIERI	A Turkish brothel.
L30241	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Oh!
L30240	u260	m16	SALIERI	A brothel.
L30239	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	What's that?
L30238	u260	m16	SALIERI	In a harem.
L30237	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Where?
L30236	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
L30235	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Why not?
L30234	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
L30233	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	How do you know?
L30232	u260	m16	SALIERI	No.
L30231	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Is there a part for me?
L30230	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L30229	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
L30228	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
L30227	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
L30226	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
L30225	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
L30224	u260	m16	SALIERI	Good morning.
L30223	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Maestro.
L30337	u255	m16	MOZART	Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
L30336	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
L30332	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
L30331	u255	m16	MOZART	What??
L30330	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Is she a good fuck?
L30325	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	I'm so relieved.
L30324	u255	m16	MOZART	No, she's fine.
L30323	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
L30322	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh - excuse me!
L30305	u255	m16	MOZART	I'll be right back.
L30304	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Don't bother.
L30303	u255	m16	MOZART	What?
L30302	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Don't bother!
L30301	u255	m16	MOZART	Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
L30356	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
L30355	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	You have leave to try.
L30354	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
L30353	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	And how will you make him keep it?
L30352	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
L30351	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
L30350	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Sir -
L30349	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
L30348	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
L30347	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Hardly.
L30346	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
L30345	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	No! I won't have him back.
L30102	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
L30101	u255	m16	MOZART	No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
L30100	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
L30099	u255	m16	MOZART	If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
L30098	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
L30097	u255	m16	MOZART	Humiliated?
L30096	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
L30095	u255	m16	MOZART	Why what, sir?
L30983	u246	m16	COMMENDATORE	Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
L30982	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!

L30953	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
L30952	u246	m16	COMMENDATORE	I've come to dinnnnnner!
L30951	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Who the devil are you? What do you want?

L30480	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
L30464	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
L30463	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	But! I'm a married woman!
L30462	u260	m16	SALIERI	It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
L30461	u260	m16	SALIERI	Isn't it obvious?
L30460	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	What do you mean?
L30459	u260	m16	SALIERI	Some service deserves service in return. No?
L30458	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	What for?
L30457	u260	m16	SALIERI	Alone.
L30456	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Tonight?
L30455	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come back tonight.
L30454	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh, thank you, sir!
L30453	u260	m16	SALIERI	Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
L30451	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
L30450	u260	m16	SALIERI	It is miraculous.
L30445	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
L30444	u260	m16	SALIERI	These are originals?
L30443	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Yes.
L30442	u260	m16	SALIERI	Originals?
L30441	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
L30440	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
L30439	u260	m16	SALIERI	Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
L30438	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
L30434	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
L30433	u260	m16	SALIERI	I see.
L30432	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	No, sir. This is my own idea.
L30431	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then he didn't send you?
L30430	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
L30429	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really?
L30428	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
L30427	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
L30426	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
L30425	u260	m16	SALIERI	I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
L30424	u260	m16	SALIERI	I understand.
L30423	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	He's terribly busy, sir.
L30422	u260	m16	SALIERI	How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
L30421	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.

L30418	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Excellency!
L31115	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
L31114	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
L31113	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Money! Money!
L31112	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
L31111	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!

L31109	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	He's doing his best.
L31108	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
L31107	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Leave him alone!
L31106	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
L31085	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I hope so. I need it immediately.
L31084	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
L31083	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Where's our friend?
L31082	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Not at all.
L31081	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Am I interrupting something?
L31017	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?

L30738	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
L30737	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
L30736	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
L30723	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
L30722	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
L30721	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
L30659	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	In three months! Papa.
L30658	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	When, may I ask?

L30963	u263	m16	SECOND LADY	Adorable!
L30962	u248	m16	FIRST LADY	He's adorable!
L30957	u263	m16	SECOND LADY	Be careful!
L30956	u248	m16	FIRST LADY	Be careful!
L30268	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
L30267	u249	m16	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
L30264	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
L30263	u249	m16	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
L30262	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
L30261	u249	m16	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
L30260	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
L30617	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Yes. He is a little strange.
L30616	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	What a strange young man.
L30606	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Michael!
L30605	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	I said play!
L30582	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
L30581	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
L30580	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
L30579	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Gertrude!
L30578	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
L30575	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	You can't be Herr Mozart!
L30574	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Gertrude!
L30573	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Upstairs.
L30602	u255	m16	MOZART	Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
L30601	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
L30600	u255	m16	MOZART	Who was your teacher?
L30599	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Just one year.
L30589	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Wine?
L30588	u255	m16	MOZART	I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
L30587	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
L30584	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Ah, now! Here she comes.
L30583	u255	m16	MOZART	Really?
L30889	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, look at them.
L30888	u260	m16	SALIERI	It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
L30887	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Do you like this, Salieri?
L30521	u260	m16	SALIERI	Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
L30520	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes?
L30519	u260	m16	SALIERI	As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
L30518	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Really?
L30517	u260	m16	SALIERI	I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
L30516	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Of course not.
L30515	u260	m16	SALIERI	Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
L30514	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Oh?
L30513	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
L30512	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Why not?
L30511	u260	m16	SALIERI	Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
L30510	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
L30378	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well. There it is.
L30377	u260	m16	SALIERI	Sire.
L30376	u251	m16	JOSEPH	You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
L30375	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
L30374	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
L30373	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
L30372	u251	m16	JOSEPH	And the result satisfies.
L30371	u260	m16	SALIERI	You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
L30370	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes?
L30369	u260	m16	SALIERI	An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
L30368	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
L30367	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
L30365	u260	m16	SALIERI	Your Highness.
L30364	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
L30204	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
L30203	u260	m16	SALIERI	Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
L30202	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, I'm glad to hear that.
L30179	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
L30178	u260	m16	SALIERI	My pleasure.
L30170	u260	m16	SALIERI	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
L30169	u251	m16	JOSEPH	And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
L30156	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha!
L30155	u260	m16	SALIERI	A-flat, Majesty.
L30154	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
L30153	u260	m16	SALIERI	You do me too much honour, Sire.
L30152	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
L30151	u260	m16	SALIERI	Majesty.
L30150	u251	m16	JOSEPH	May I try it?
L30149	u260	m16	SALIERI	It's just a trifle, of course.
L30148	u251	m16	JOSEPH	What a charming idea. May I see?
L30124	u251	m16	JOSEPH	You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
L30123	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
L30833	u255	m16	MOZART	Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
L30832	u251	m16	JOSEPH	You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
L30831	u255	m16	MOZART	Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
L30821	u255	m16	MOZART	Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
L30820	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
L30819	u255	m16	MOZART	Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
L30818	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I have no idea.
L30817	u255	m16	MOZART	But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
L30816	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah, love again.
L30815	u255	m16	MOZART	But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
L30814	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
L30813	u255	m16	MOZART	Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
L30812	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
L30809	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
L30808	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Would you tell me why?
L30807	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, yes, I admit it is.
L30806	u251	m16	JOSEPH	It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
L30805	u255	m16	MOZART	Who told you this, Majesty?
L30804	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
L30803	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, Sire.
L30802	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
L30768	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah! By all means.
L30767	u255	m16	MOZART	May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
L30766	u251	m16	JOSEPH	What is it?
L30765	u255	m16	MOZART	Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
L30762	u255	m16	MOZART	Thank you, Sire!
L30761	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
L30296	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
L30295	u255	m16	MOZART	Twenty-six.
L30294	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Excuse me, but how old are you?
L30293	u255	m16	MOZART	Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
L30292	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
L30290	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Enchanted, Madame.
L30289	u255	m16	MOZART	Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
L30285	u255	m16	MOZART	Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
L30284	u251	m16	JOSEPH	My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
L30281	u251	m16	JOSEPH	My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
L30280	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
L30277	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
L30276	u255	m16	MOZART	What do you mean, Sire?
L30275	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
L30274	u255	m16	MOZART	So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
L30273	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
L30272	u255	m16	MOZART	And German?
L30271	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes, indeed.
L30270	u255	m16	MOZART	It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
L30213	u255	m16	MOZART	I think so, Sire, yes.
L30212	u251	m16	JOSEPH	What? On one hearing only?
L30211	u255	m16	MOZART	Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
L30195	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha.
L30194	u255	m16	MOZART	In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
L30193	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes, where?
L30192	u255	m16	MOZART	It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
L30191	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
L30187	u255	m16	MOZART	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
L30186	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Why so?
L30181	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
L30180	u255	m16	MOZART	Majesty!
L30177	u255	m16	MOZART	Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
L30176	u251	m16	JOSEPH	And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
L30168	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
L30167	u251	m16	JOSEPH	The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
L30166	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, thank you.
L30162	u251	m16	JOSEPH	No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
L30161	u255	m16	MOZART	Your Majesty!
L30146	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
L30145	u267	m16	VON STRACK	He's here.
L30144	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes, what about him?
L30143	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
L30142	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, what do you have for me today?
L30126	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well. There it is.
L30125	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Yes, sir.
L30119	u267	m16	VON STRACK	In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
L30118	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
L30115	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
L30114	u267	m16	VON STRACK	I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
L30113	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
L30775	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
L30774	u255	m16	MOZART	Father -
L30735	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	She does. She says I sleep all day.
L30734	u255	m16	MOZART	No one calls you that.
L30733	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
L30732	u255	m16	MOZART	Papa!
L30731	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
L30716	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
L30715	u255	m16	MOZART	Are you playing a trick on me?
L30714	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Mine?
L30713	u255	m16	MOZART	Papa, is this your idea?
L30683	u255	m16	MOZART	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
L30682	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
L30679	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
L30678	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
L30673	u255	m16	MOZART	This is just a game, Papa.
L30672	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	No, really!
L30669	u255	m16	MOZART	Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
L30668	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
L30662	u255	m16	MOZART	Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
L30661	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
L30660	u255	m16	MOZART	Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
L30652	u255	m16	MOZART	It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
L30651	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	You don't have secrets from me.
L30650	u255	m16	MOZART	It's a secret.
L30649	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Why not?
L30648	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, let's not talk about it.
L30647	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	What's that?
L30646	u255	m16	MOZART	This one will.
L30645	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
L30644	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
L30643	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	How many?
L30642	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes.
L30641	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Yes.
L30640	u255	m16	MOZART	Pupils?
L30639	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	How many pupils do you have?
L30638	u255	m16	MOZART	Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
L30637	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	They say you're in debt.
L30636	u255	m16	MOZART	What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
L30635	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	That's not what I hear.
L30634	u255	m16	MOZART	It couldn't be better.
L30633	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	How is your financial situation?
L30632	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
L30631	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Don't you have a maid?
L30630	u255	m16	MOZART	She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
L30627	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
L30626	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Do you always live like this?
L30625	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
L30624	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Is she not here?
L30623	u255	m16	MOZART	Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
L30621	u255	m16	MOZART	Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
L30620	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Am I not welcome?
L30619	u255	m16	MOZART	Why are you here?
L30359	u255	m16	MOZART	I will.
L30358	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
L31131	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you sure it's an opera?
L31130	u253	m16	LORL	Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
L31129	u260	m16	SALIERI	Opera? Opera!
L31128	u253	m16	LORL	I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
L31127	u260	m16	SALIERI	Is he working?
L31126	u253	m16	LORL	I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
L31125	u260	m16	SALIERI	Is he working?
L31124	u253	m16	LORL	Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
L31123	u260	m16	SALIERI	Where?
L31122	u253	m16	LORL	I don't know. He has pains.
L31121	u260	m16	SALIERI	What medicine?
L31120	u253	m16	LORL	You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
L31119	u260	m16	SALIERI	Why? What has happened?
L31118	u253	m16	LORL	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
L31117	u260	m16	SALIERI	Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
L30760	u253	m16	LORL	In there, sir.
L30759	u260	m16	SALIERI	Where does he work?
L30757	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes what?
L30756	u253	m16	LORL	I think I've found out about the money, sir.
L30754	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
L30753	u253	m16	LORL	Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
L30752	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really? What is it he's writing?
L30751	u253	m16	LORL	Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
L30750	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
L30749	u253	m16	LORL	Not that I've seen.
L30748	u260	m16	SALIERI	Do any pupils come to the house?
L30747	u253	m16	LORL	Oh, thank you, sir.
L30222	u260	m16	SALIERI	Bene.
L30221	u253	m16	LORL	Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
L30135	u260	m16	SALIERI	Bene! Bene!
L30134	u253	m16	LORL	Yes, thank you, sir.
L30133	u260	m16	SALIERI	Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
L30132	u253	m16	LORL	I will, sir.
L30131	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
L30130	u260	m16	SALIERI	What have you got for me today? Let me see.
L30129	u253	m16	LORL	Good morning, sir.
L30128	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
L30712	u253	m16	LORL	Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
L30711	u255	m16	MOZART	Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
L30708	u253	m16	LORL	They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
L30707	u255	m16	MOZART	What?
L30706	u253	m16	LORL	My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
L30705	u255	m16	MOZART	That's right.
L30704	u253	m16	LORL	Are you Herr Mozart?
L30703	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes?
L31104	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	So let me see it. Where is it?
L31103	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, we can.
L31102	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
L31101	u255	m16	MOZART	Because there's nothing to see.
L31100	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Why not?
L31099	u255	m16	MOZART	No.
L31098	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Can I see it?
L31097	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes.
L31096	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
L31095	u255	m16	MOZART	What?
L31094	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
L31093	u255	m16	MOZART	Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
L31092	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	What is this?
L31091	u255	m16	MOZART	Put it down!
L31090	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Wolfi!
L31089	u255	m16	MOZART	Leave that alone!
L31015	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	So there you are. What do you say?
L31014	u255	m16	MOZART	No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
L31013	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
L31012	u255	m16	MOZART	German!
L31011	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
L31010	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
L31009	u255	m16	MOZART	Animals?
L31008	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
L31007	u255	m16	MOZART	I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
L31006	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
L31005	u255	m16	MOZART	I liked the horse.
L31004	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Yes, well, it's all good fun.
L31003	u255	m16	MOZART	Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
L30920	u255	m16	MOZART	That kind of music should be punishable by death.
L30919	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Sublime! Utterly sublime!
L30918	u255	m16	MOZART	Well?
L30681	u255	m16	MOZART	Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
L30680	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	What did he say? What did he say?
L30496	u255	m16	MOZART	Sssh! Stay here.
L30495	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
L30494	u255	m16	MOZART	Sssh!
L31043	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	My answer is no, Mozart.
L31042	u255	m16	MOZART	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
L31041	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	I'm sorry. No.
L31040	u255	m16	MOZART	No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
L31039	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
L31038	u255	m16	MOZART	If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
L31037	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	What for?
L31036	u255	m16	MOZART	Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
L31035	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
L31034	u255	m16	MOZART	Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
L31033	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
L31032	u255	m16	MOZART	Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
L31031	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
L30615	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
L30614	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
L30598	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
L30597	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
L30586	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
L30585	u255	m16	MOZART	Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
L30577	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
L30576	u255	m16	MOZART	I'm afraid I am.
L30572	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
L30571	u255	m16	MOZART	Madame.
L30570	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
L30568	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
L30567	u255	m16	MOZART	And which one of them do you want me to teach?
L30566	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
L31308	u255	m16	MOZART	I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
L31307	u260	m16	SALIERI	What for?
L31306	u255	m16	MOZART	I am so ashamed.
L31305	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm not leaving you.
L31304	u255	m16	MOZART	Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
L31303	u260	m16	SALIERI	I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
L31302	u255	m16	MOZART	We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
L31301	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
L31300	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you want to rest a bit?
L31299	u255	m16	MOZART	Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
L31298	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31297	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you have it?
L31296	u260	m16	SALIERI	You go fast!
L31295	u255	m16	MOZART	And that's it. Do you have it?
L31292	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes!
L31291	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, and on 'dictis'.
L31290	u260	m16	SALIERI	Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
L31289	u255	m16	MOZART	C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
L31288	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
L31287	u260	m16	SALIERI	That's wonderful!
L31285	u255	m16	MOZART	Show me.
L31284	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think so.
L31283	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you have me?
L31281	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
L31280	u260	m16	SALIERI	And that's all?
L31279	u255	m16	MOZART	Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
L31278	u260	m16	SALIERI	Also identical?
L31277	u255	m16	MOZART	With the tenors.
L31276	u260	m16	SALIERI	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
L31275	u255	m16	MOZART	It couldn't be simpler.
L31274	u260	m16	SALIERI	Please! Just one moment.
L31273	u255	m16	MOZART	Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
L31272	u255	m16	MOZART	Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
L31271	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31270	u255	m16	MOZART	Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
L31269	u255	m16	MOZART	Sing it back.
L31268	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think so.
L31267	u255	m16	MOZART	Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
L31266	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31265	u255	m16	MOZART	Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
L31264	u255	m16	MOZART	Common time.
L31263	u260	m16	SALIERI	What time?
L31262	u255	m16	MOZART	The Fire.
L31261	u255	m16	MOZART	So now - A minor. Suddenly.
L31260	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31259	u255	m16	MOZART	We ended in F Major?
L31258	u260	m16	SALIERI	Confutatis Maledictis.
L31257	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come. Let's begin.
L31256	u255	m16	MOZART	Strange!
L31255	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh, yes.
L31254	u255	m16	MOZART	A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
L31253	u260	m16	SALIERI	What?
L31252	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you believe in it?
L31251	u260	m16	SALIERI	Consigned to flames of woe.
L31250	u255	m16	MOZART	So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
L31249	u260	m16	SALIERI	The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
L31248	u255	m16	MOZART	Where did I stop?
L31238	u255	m16	MOZART	A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
L31237	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
L31236	u255	m16	MOZART	You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
L31235	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course.
L31234	u255	m16	MOZART	But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
L31233	u260	m16	SALIERI	My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
L31232	u255	m16	MOZART	Would you? Actually, you could.
L31231	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
L31230	u255	m16	MOZART	Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
L31211	u255	m16	MOZART	He knows. He knows!
L31210	u260	m16	SALIERI	Finish what?
L31209	u255	m16	MOZART	Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
L31207	u260	m16	SALIERI	What man?
L31206	u255	m16	MOZART	The man. He's here.
L31205	u260	m16	SALIERI	Who?
L31204	u255	m16	MOZART	No! No, it's him!
L31203	u260	m16	SALIERI	Shall I answer it?
L31202	u255	m16	MOZART	I'm too young to be so sick.
L31201	u260	m16	SALIERI	What?
L31200	u255	m16	MOZART	The doctor thinks I am. But -
L31199	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you ill?
L31198	u255	m16	MOZART	I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
L31197	u260	m16	SALIERI	I do.
L31196	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you mean that?
L31195	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
L31194	u255	m16	MOZART	This is only a vaudeville.
L31193	u260	m16	SALIERI	I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
L31192	u255	m16	MOZART	I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
L31191	u260	m16	SALIERI	No, please.
L31190	u255	m16	MOZART	You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
L31189	u260	m16	SALIERI	You mean she's not coming back?
L31188	u255	m16	MOZART	Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
L31187	u260	m16	SALIERI	Where is your wife?
L31183	u255	m16	MOZART	No, no. I have to get back. I have -
L31182	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
L31181	u255	m16	MOZART	What happened? Is it over?
L31134	u255	m16	MOZART	No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
L31133	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you neglecting my request?
L31132	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
L31062	u260	m16	SALIERI	Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
L31061	u255	m16	MOZART	How long will you give me?
L31059	u255	m16	MOZART	How much?
L31058	u260	m16	SALIERI	I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
L31057	u255	m16	MOZART	Who are you?
L31056	u260	m16	SALIERI	A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
L31055	u255	m16	MOZART	What dead? Who is dead?
L31054	u260	m16	SALIERI	A Mass for the dead.
L31053	u255	m16	MOZART	What work?
L31052	u260	m16	SALIERI	I have come to commission work from you.
L30929	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
L30928	u260	m16	SALIERI	You flatter me.
L30927	u255	m16	MOZART	I never knew that music like that was possible.
L30926	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes?
L30925	u255	m16	MOZART	How could it not, Excellency?
L30924	u260	m16	SALIERI	Did my work please you?
L30923	u255	m16	MOZART	How could I not?
L30922	u260	m16	SALIERI	Mozart. It was good of you to come.
L30915	u255	m16	MOZART	Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
L30914	u260	m16	SALIERI	Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
L30913	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
L30912	u260	m16	SALIERI	I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
L30911	u255	m16	MOZART	I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
L30910	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
L30909	u255	m16	MOZART	It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
L30908	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think it's marvelous. Truly.
L30907	u255	m16	MOZART	What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
L30906	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
L30905	u255	m16	MOZART	But what is it they don't like?
L30904	u260	m16	SALIERI	I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
L30903	u255	m16	MOZART	Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
L30880	u255	m16	MOZART	Thank you! Oh, thank you.
L30879	u260	m16	SALIERI	With all my heart, Mozart.
L30878	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, Excellency, would you?
L30877	u260	m16	SALIERI	But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
L30876	u255	m16	MOZART	It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
L30875	u260	m16	SALIERI	How fortunate.
L30874	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
L30873	u260	m16	SALIERI	You burned the score?
L30872	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
L30871	u260	m16	SALIERI	Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
L30870	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
L30869	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really? Why?
L30868	u255	m16	MOZART	It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
L30867	u260	m16	SALIERI	Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
L30565	u260	m16	SALIERI	I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
L30564	u255	m16	MOZART	I can't say. Really
L30563	u260	m16	SALIERI	What exactly are you working on?
L30562	u255	m16	MOZART	Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
L30561	u260	m16	SALIERI	Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
L30560	u255	m16	MOZART	Ah. Italian?
L30559	u260	m16	SALIERI	Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
L30558	u255	m16	MOZART	Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
L30557	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
L30556	u255	m16	MOZART	I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
L30555	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
L30554	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
L30553	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm afraid not.
L30552	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you have a daughter?
L30551	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course not.
L30550	u255	m16	MOZART	They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
L30549	u260	m16	SALIERI	How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
L30548	u255	m16	MOZART	How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
L30547	u260	m16	SALIERI	It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
L30546	u255	m16	MOZART	No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
L30545	u260	m16	SALIERI	You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
L30544	u255	m16	MOZART	Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
L30543	u260	m16	SALIERI	An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
L30542	u255	m16	MOZART	But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
L30541	u260	m16	SALIERI	No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
L30540	u255	m16	MOZART	Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
L30539	u260	m16	SALIERI	Herr Sommer.
L30538	u255	m16	MOZART	Whom did they choose?
L30537	u260	m16	SALIERI	My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
L30536	u255	m16	MOZART	Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
L30535	u260	m16	SALIERI	I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
L30534	u255	m16	MOZART	Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
L30533	u260	m16	SALIERI	Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
L30532	u255	m16	MOZART	So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
L30531	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
L30530	u255	m16	MOZART	She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
L30529	u260	m16	SALIERI	So you are. How is your pretty wife?
L30528	u255	m16	MOZART	Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
L30527	u260	m16	SALIERI	Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
L30329	u255	m16	MOZART	It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
L30328	u260	m16	SALIERI	How could I not?
L30327	u255	m16	MOZART	Did you like it, then?
L30326	u260	m16	SALIERI	Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
L30283	u255	m16	MOZART	But this is absurd!
L30282	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
L30206	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
L30205	u255	m16	MOZART	Love, Sire!
L30175	u255	m16	MOZART	A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
L30174	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah!
L30173	u255	m16	MOZART	Mio caro Adone.
L30172	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really?
L30171	u255	m16	MOZART	I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
L30895	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
L30894	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
L30864	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Taking out what you should never have put in.
L30863	u255	m16	MOZART	What are you doing, Herr Director?
L30860	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
L30859	u255	m16	MOZART	But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
L30858	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Exactly. A dance.
L30857	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
L30856	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
L30854	u255	m16	MOZART	Certainly, Herr Director.
L30853	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
L30837	u255	m16	MOZART	Just let me tell you how it begins.
L30836	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	That will do, Herr Mozart!
L30811	u255	m16	MOZART	But, Your Majesty -
L30810	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
L30199	u255	m16	MOZART	Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
L30198	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Then why especially does it have to be in German?
L30197	u255	m16	MOZART	Exactly.
L30196	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You mean in Turkey?
L30190	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	I think you'd better.
L30189	u255	m16	MOZART	I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
L30188	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Oh? Have I seen it?
L30839	u255	m16	MOZART	May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
L30838	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Herr Mozart -
L30397	u255	m16	MOZART	Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
L30396	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
L30395	u255	m16	MOZART	Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
L30394	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Mozart -
L30393	u255	m16	MOZART	They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
L30392	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Mozart -
L30391	u255	m16	MOZART	Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
L30390	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
L30389	u255	m16	MOZART	Who is on this committee?
L30388	u267	m16	VON STRACK	A little modesty would suit you better.
L30387	u255	m16	MOZART	No, but I'm the best.
L30386	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
L30385	u255	m16	MOZART	Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
L30384	u267	m16	VON STRACK	On the contrary.
L30383	u255	m16	MOZART	Is the Emperor angry with me?
L30382	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Because His Majesty wishes it.
L30381	u255	m16	MOZART	Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
L30380	u267	m16	VON STRACK	What is what?
L30379	u255	m16	MOZART	What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
L30826	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
L30825	u255	m16	MOZART	Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
L30824	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
L30823	u255	m16	MOZART	Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
L30822	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Mozart -
L30764	u255	m16	MOZART	Baron!
L30763	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
L30201	u255	m16	MOZART	Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
L30200	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
L30185	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
L30184	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	I don't think it was really decided, Director.
L31341	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
L31340	u266	m16	VOGLER	Oh my son, my poor son!
L31339	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
L31338	u266	m16	VOGLER	My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
L31337	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	What difference does that make?
L31336	u266	m16	VOGLER	But not his body.
L31335	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I poisoned his life.
L31334	u266	m16	VOGLER	No, you didn't!
L31333	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I did.
L31332	u266	m16	VOGLER	Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
L31076	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
L31075	u266	m16	VOGLER	Yes.
L31074	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
L31073	u266	m16	VOGLER	What?
L30474	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
L30473	u266	m16	VOGLER	I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
L30472	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
L30471	u266	m16	VOGLER	My son, no one can speak for God.
L30470	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
L30469	u266	m16	VOGLER	God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
L30468	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	No? Was Mozart a good man?
L30467	u266	m16	VOGLER	You cannot say that!
L30466	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
L30342	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
L30341	u266	m16	VOGLER	Did you try?
L30340	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
L30029	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
L30028	u266	m16	VOGLER	Do you hear me?
L30026	u266	m16	VOGLER	Should I?
L30025	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Do you believe it?
L30024	u266	m16	VOGLER	Is it true?
L30023	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	And do they believe it?
L30022	u266	m16	VOGLER	All Vienna has heard that.
L30021	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Ah - you've heard that?
L30020	u266	m16	VOGLER	Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
L30019	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
L30018	u266	m16	VOGLER	Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
L30017	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
L30016	u266	m16	VOGLER	I regret it is not too familiar.
L30015	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Well?
L30013	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
L30012	u266	m16	VOGLER	I can't say I do. What is it?
L30011	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Then you must know this.
L30010	u266	m16	VOGLER	Here in Vienna.
L30009	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Where?
L30008	u266	m16	VOGLER	I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
L30007	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	How well are you trained in music?
L30006	u266	m16	VOGLER	My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
L30005	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I do not seek forgiveness.
L30004	u266	m16	VOGLER	Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
L30003	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Are they?
L30002	u266	m16	VOGLER	That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
L30001	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
L30000	u266	m16	VOGLER	I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
L29999	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Leave me alone.
L29998	u266	m16	VOGLER	Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
L29997	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	What do you want?
L29996	u266	m16	VOGLER	In the sight of God that is a sin.
L29995	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	So?
L29994	u266	m16	VOGLER	You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
L29993	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	About what?
L29992	u266	m16	VOGLER	I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
L29991	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	What do you want?
L30852	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, in the third act.
L30851	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
L30850	u260	m16	SALIERI	Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
L30849	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Ballet? What ballet?
L30848	u260	m16	SALIERI	About the ballet.
L30847	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	What anger?
L30844	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	The Emperor has given him permission.
L30843	u260	m16	SALIERI	Incredible.
L30842	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
L30794	u260	m16	SALIERI	Never mind.
L30793	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Where?
L30792	u260	m16	SALIERI	I've seen the manuscript.
L30791	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Are you absolutely sure?
L30787	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You must be mad.
L30786	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L30785	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	He's setting that play to music?
L30784	u260	m16	SALIERI	Exactly.
L30783	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You mean that play?
L30780	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Italian?
L30779	u260	m16	SALIERI	Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
L30778	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Yes?
L30777	u260	m16	SALIERI	I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
L30799	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Ah.
L30798	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
L30797	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Oh yes, yes. And that was?
L30796	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
L30795	u267	m16	VON STRACK	I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
L30183	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Did we?
L30182	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
L30159	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Well done, Sire!
L30158	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Bravo, Your Majesty!
L31180	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
L31179	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
L31178	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
L31177	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	What do you mean - now?
L31176	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Well, promise then.
L31175	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	I can't wait.
L31174	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
L31173	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
L31172	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
L31171	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	What? Who the devil are you?
L31170	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Here I am, my angel.
L31050	u260	m16	SALIERI	Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
L31049	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
L31048	u260	m16	SALIERI	No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
L31047	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
L31046	u260	m16	SALIERI	I agree, Baron.
L31045	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
L30526	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come with me. And stay in the room.
L30525	u264	m16	SERVANT	He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
L30524	u260	m16	SALIERI	What does he want?
L30478	u260	m16	SALIERI	Show her in. Then go to bed.
L30477	u264	m16	SERVANT	That lady is back, sir.
L30417	u260	m16	SALIERI	Excuse me, my dear.
L30416	u264	m16	SERVANT	She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
L30415	u260	m16	SALIERI	Who is she?
L30414	u264	m16	SERVANT	Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
L31226	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
L31225	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
L31223	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
L31222	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I'll call tomorrow.
L31221	u260	m16	SALIERI	Bene.
L31220	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
L31219	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course.
L31218	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
L31217	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
L31216	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	But he's all right?
L31215	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
L31214	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Can we come in?
L31213	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, I am looking after him.
L31212	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Herr Salieri.
L63586	u435	m27	1/16TH BLACK	Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
L63585	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	You truly are a dancing fool.

L63187	u443	m27	HONEYCUTT	That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.

L62751	u452	m27	SLOAN	That's mighty black of you.
L62750	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
L62749	u452	m27	SLOAN	If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
L62748	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
L62747	u452	m27	SLOAN	That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
L62746	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
L62745	u452	m27	SLOAN	You don't have the demographics.
L62744	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
L62743	u452	m27	SLOAN	What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
L62742	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	Yeah, him.
L62741	u452	m27	SLOAN	Delacroix.
L62740	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
L62739	u452	m27	SLOAN	Please.
L62738	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
L62737	u452	m27	SLOAN	Who are you revolting against?
L62736	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
L62735	u452	m27	SLOAN	Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
L62734	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
L62733	u452	m27	SLOAN	I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
L62732	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
L62731	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
L62730	u452	m27	SLOAN	I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
L62729	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
L62728	u452	m27	SLOAN	I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
L62727	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	Give me some?
L62726	u452	m27	SLOAN	Well you did.
L62725	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	I didn't mean to scare you like that.
L62724	u452	m27	SLOAN	You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.

L62976	u439	m27	DELACROIX	And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
L62975	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
L62974	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What's your name?
L62973	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
L63481	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
L63480	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
L63476	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	I'm a revolutionary.
L63475	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	What do you do?
L63474	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	What do I do?
L63473	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
L63468	u437	m27	BIG BLACK	Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.

L63431	u438	m27	CHEEBA	I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
L63430	u447	m27	MANTAN	Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
L63429	u438	m27	CHEEBA	You can walk away.  We both can.
L63428	u447	m27	MANTAN	Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
L63427	u438	m27	CHEEBA	You're in this up till ya neck.
L63426	u447	m27	MANTAN	Damn skippy.
L63425	u438	m27	CHEEBA	So that's what you been doing?
L63424	u447	m27	MANTAN	Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
L63423	u438	m27	CHEEBA	I'm out.
L63422	u447	m27	MANTAN	Meaning?
L63421	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
L63420	u447	m27	MANTAN	What are you talkin' about?
L63419	u438	m27	CHEEBA	I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
L63254	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Look at my lips.
L63253	u447	m27	MANTAN	Why they gotta make my nose so big?
L62898	u438	m27	CHEEBA	In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
L62897	u447	m27	MANTAN	Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
L62896	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Please, have a seat.
L62891	u447	m27	MANTAN	Must be the pressure.
L62890	u438	m27	CHEEBA	What's wrong with him?
L62881	u447	m27	MANTAN	You ain't happy about the green light?
L62880	u438	m27	CHEEBA	DeLa - what's the matter with you.
L62833	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
L62832	u447	m27	MANTAN	You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
L62831	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
L62830	u447	m27	MANTAN	Seconds and thirds, too.
L62829	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
L62828	u447	m27	MANTAN	What's that?
L62827	u438	m27	CHEEBA	She's also moorish.
L62826	u447	m27	MANTAN	Certified ladies' man, huh?
L62825	u438	m27	CHEEBA	No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
L62824	u447	m27	MANTAN	It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
L62823	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
L62822	u447	m27	MANTAN	I'm not smiling.
L62821	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Why are you smiling so?
L62820	u447	m27	MANTAN	You might be right.
L62819	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
L62845	u439	m27	DELACROIX	That can be done.
L62844	u438	m27	CHEEBA	We might need some mo' money behind this.
L62843	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
L62757	u439	m27	DELACROIX	And this is Manray.
L62756	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Nice to meet you.
L62701	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
L62700	u438	m27	CHEEBA	What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
L62695	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Different.
L62694	u438	m27	CHEEBA	What kind of show is this gonna be?
L62690	u439	m27	DELACROIX	First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
L62689	u438	m27	CHEEBA	How much?
L62688	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
L62682	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Manray needs a job.
L62681	u439	m27	DELACROIX	No offense.
L62680	u438	m27	CHEEBA	You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
L62679	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
L62562	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
L62561	u439	m27	DELACROIX	De-la-croix.
L62560	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
L62559	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Good morning, Cheeba.
L62842	u446	m27	MANRAY	DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
L62841	u438	m27	CHEEBA	That ain't funny.
L62686	u438	m27	CHEEBA	We're starving.
L62685	u446	m27	MANRAY	If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
L62684	u438	m27	CHEEBA	We was coming to see you.
L62683	u446	m27	MANRAY	We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
L62646	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
L62645	u446	m27	MANRAY	We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
L62629	u446	m27	MANRAY	I'm tired of waiting.
L62628	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
L62627	u446	m27	MANRAY	And I'm the feet.
L62626	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
L62625	u446	m27	MANRAY	Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
L62624	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Ahh, the luxuries of life.
L62622	u438	m27	CHEEBA	Did we get our bill yet?
L62621	u446	m27	MANRAY	Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
L62620	u438	m27	CHEEBA	My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
L62619	u446	m27	MANRAY	I'm starvin' like Marvin.
L63568	u439	m27	DELACROIX	No costume.  No blackface.
L63567	u446	m27	MANRAY	I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
L63566	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
L63565	u446	m27	MANRAY	I won't do it anymore.
L63564	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How you sound?
L63563	u446	m27	MANRAY	I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
L62847	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Mantan!!
L62846	u446	m27	MANRAY	Mantan?
L62836	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You have to start getting into your character.
L62835	u446	m27	MANRAY	Why?
L62834	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
L62706	u446	m27	MANRAY	Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
L62705	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You're now Mantan.
L62704	u446	m27	MANRAY	To what?
L62703	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I would like to change your name.
L62699	u439	m27	DELACROIX	That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
L62698	u446	m27	MANRAY	DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
L62697	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
L62696	u446	m27	MANRAY	How different?
L62693	u446	m27	MANRAY	Where do I sign?
L62692	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Some tap dancing, some singing.
L62691	u446	m27	MANRAY	What do I have to do?
L62637	u439	m27	DELACROIX	EUREKA!!
L62636	u446	m27	MANRAY	My tap shoes.
L62566	u446	m27	MANRAY	Well do something about it.
L62565	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
L63326	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
L63325	u442	m27	GARY BYRD	Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
L63324	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
L63323	u442	m27	GARY BYRD	But the line has to be drawn.
L63322	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
L63321	u442	m27	GARY BYRD	No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
L63320	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
L63319	u442	m27	GARY BYRD	Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
L63097	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
L63096	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I gots to go, it's my Moms.
L63095	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
L63094	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Hold on a sec, I got a call.
L63093	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
L63092	u439	m27	DELACROIX	This has to be a big mistake.
L63091	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
L63090	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
L63023	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
L63022	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
L63021	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
L63020	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
L63018	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Calm down, please.
L63017	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
L62997	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Dunwitty, don't leave.
L62996	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
L62935	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
L62934	u439	m27	DELACROIX	In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
L62933	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
L62932	u439	m27	DELACROIX	That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
L62931	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	"If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."
L62930	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
L62929	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
L62928	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
L62927	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
L62926	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
L62925	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
L62924	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
L62923	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
L62922	u439	m27	DELACROIX	"I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing ""Amos and Andy.""  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain."
L62812	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
L62811	u439	m27	DELACROIX	We think so.
L62810	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
L62800	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
L62799	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I don't know about that plantation angle.
L62798	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
L62797	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
L62796	u439	m27	DELACROIX	"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""
L62795	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
L62794	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
L62793	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Who are the other characters?
L62792	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
L62791	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
L62790	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Negroes would be in an uproar.
L62789	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
L62788	u439	m27	DELACROIX	"Protest finally forced ""Amos and Andy"" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on."
L62787	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	"This could be bigger than ""Amos and Andy."""
L62786	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Yep, you guessed it.
L62785	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
L62784	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
L62783	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Exactly!
L62782	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
L62781	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	What are there character traits?
L62780	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
L62779	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
L62778	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
L62777	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	That's a great handle.
L62774	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
L62773	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
L62772	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
L62771	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
L62770	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I'm feelin' dis'!
L62769	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
L62768	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
L62767	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	The name of the show?
L62766	u439	m27	DELACROIX	So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
L62765	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Word!!!
L62764	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
L62763	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Go on.  Good so far.
L62762	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
L62761	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I'm wid it.
L62760	u439	m27	DELACROIX	We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
L62753	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
L62752	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
L62618	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
L62617	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
L62616	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
L62615	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
L62614	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	"That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know ""niggers"" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water."
L62613	u439	m27	DELACROIX	"I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some ""nigger"" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"
L62612	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
L62611	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I've never been given a fair shot.
L62610	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
L62609	u439	m27	DELACROIX	...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
L62608	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
L62607	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I'm telling you it's not.
L62606	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
L62605	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
L62602	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
L62601	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
L62600	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	"I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know ""niggers"" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I."
L62599	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
L62598	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
L62597	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
L62595	u439	m27	DELACROIX	C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
L62594	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Do you know what C.P. Time is?
L62578	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
L62577	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
L62576	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Four minutes ago.
L62575	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
L62574	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
L62573	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I'm sorry I'm late.
L62572	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
L63170	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Always keep 'em laughing.
L63169	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I love you too, Daddy.
L63168	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
L63167	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Let's get him over to the bed.
L63164	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
L63163	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I didn't mean that, in life.
L63162	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
L63161	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Where do you go from here?
L63160	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
L63159	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Nuthin' I can't handle.
L63158	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
L63157	u439	m27	DELACROIX	The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
L63156	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Enough about me, what's happening with you?
L63155	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	"All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the ""life's too short"" category."
L63154	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
L63153	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
L63152	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
L63151	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
L63150	u439	m27	DELACROIX	That's what I'm askin'.
L63149	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
L63148	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How did you end up here?
L63147	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
L63146	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
L63145	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Purely for medicinal purposes.
L63144	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
L63143	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Daddy, she's younger than me.
L63142	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Good woman.  I trained her right.
L63137	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Pleased to meet you.
L63136	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
L63135	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It's been a long time.
L63134	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
L63133	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It's me, Peerless.
L63132	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	Go away, unless you got my money.
L63131	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I want to speak with you.
L63130	u445	m27	JUNEBUG	What do you want?
L63180	u440	m27	DOT	He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
L63179	u439	m27	DELACROIX	He never showed it.
L63178	u440	m27	DOT	Your father is proud of you.
L63177	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
L63176	u440	m27	DOT	I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
L63175	u439	m27	DELACROIX	So what's up with you?
L63174	u440	m27	DOT	The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
L63173	u439	m27	DELACROIX	So he drank himself into a stuper?
L63172	u440	m27	DOT	Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
L63171	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How long has my father been like this?
L63139	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Is that so?
L63138	u440	m27	DOT	Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
L63659	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Give me the gun.
L63658	u452	m27	SLOAN	I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
L63655	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
L63654	u452	m27	SLOAN	Don't make me have to use this.
L63504	u439	m27	DELACROIX	And that's how you got me in the first place.
L63503	u452	m27	SLOAN	DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
L63502	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
L63501	u452	m27	SLOAN	Work related or otherwise?
L63500	u439	m27	DELACROIX	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
L63499	u452	m27	SLOAN	That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
L63498	u452	m27	SLOAN	That's why it will be so much fun.
L63497	u439	m27	DELACROIX	This is crazy.
L63496	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
L63495	u452	m27	SLOAN	That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
L63494	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Light?
L63493	u452	m27	SLOAN	DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
L63492	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Do you have to be so damn forthright?
L63491	u452	m27	SLOAN	I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
L63490	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
L63489	u452	m27	SLOAN	Please don't go there.
L63488	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
L63487	u452	m27	SLOAN	He's just playing big brother.
L63486	u439	m27	DELACROIX	That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
L63485	u452	m27	SLOAN	You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
L63484	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
L63483	u452	m27	SLOAN	I don't want to hear it.
L63482	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Why'd you do that?
L63318	u452	m27	SLOAN	To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
L63317	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How so?
L63316	u452	m27	SLOAN	It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
L63315	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Is that good or bad?
L63314	u452	m27	SLOAN	I thought it was appropiate.
L63313	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Thanks.
L63312	u452	m27	SLOAN	This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
L63311	u439	m27	DELACROIX	The Jolly Nigger Bank.
L63307	u452	m27	SLOAN	No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
L63306	u439	m27	DELACROIX	For what?
L63305	u452	m27	SLOAN	A gift.
L63304	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What is this?
L63303	u439	m27	DELACROIX	A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
L63302	u452	m27	SLOAN	So you have your small victory, now what?
L63251	u452	m27	SLOAN	Everybody shut up.
L63250	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
L63247	u452	m27	SLOAN	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
L63246	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Who's side are you on?
L63060	u439	m27	DELACROIX	C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
L63059	u452	m27	SLOAN	I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
L63053	u452	m27	SLOAN	The pleasure is mine.
L63052	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Same here.
L63047	u452	m27	SLOAN	Just don't lie to me.
L63046	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What do you want me to say?
L63045	u452	m27	SLOAN	We both lied to him.
L63044	u452	m27	SLOAN	Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
L63043	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Your life will never be the same.
L63025	u452	m27	SLOAN	Break a leg.
L63024	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Just want to say good luck.
L63015	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
L63014	u452	m27	SLOAN	You've said that already.
L62971	u452	m27	SLOAN	The big one.
L62970	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Which one is your brother?
L62969	u452	m27	SLOAN	This is the group I was telling you about.
L62938	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired. 
L62937	u452	m27	SLOAN	Hello.
L62936	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
L62920	u452	m27	SLOAN	Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
L62919	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
L62918	u452	m27	SLOAN	What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
L62917	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
L62913	u452	m27	SLOAN	Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
L62912	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
L62911	u452	m27	SLOAN	Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
L62910	u439	m27	DELACROIX	My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
L62909	u452	m27	SLOAN	What is your problem?
L62879	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
L62878	u452	m27	SLOAN	You okay?
L62755	u439	m27	DELACROIX	This is Cheeba.
L62754	u452	m27	SLOAN	Hello.
L62667	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
L62666	u452	m27	SLOAN	Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
L62659	u439	m27	DELACROIX	And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
L62658	u452	m27	SLOAN	Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
L62657	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Good.  I'm going to need your support.
L62656	u452	m27	SLOAN	I'm in till the end.
L62655	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You getting cold feet?
L62654	u452	m27	SLOAN	Sounds risky to me.
L62653	u439	m27	DELACROIX	The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
L62652	u452	m27	SLOAN	What point is that?
L62651	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
L62650	u452	m27	SLOAN	You lost me.
L62649	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
L62648	u452	m27	SLOAN	Do you know how you will use him?
L62647	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Manray was under our nose the whole time.
L62644	u452	m27	SLOAN	The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
L62643	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
L62642	u452	m27	SLOAN	It hit me like a ton of bricks.
L62641	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How did you know?
L62640	u452	m27	SLOAN	Manray!
L62639	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Manray!
L62593	u452	m27	SLOAN	It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
L62592	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
L62591	u452	m27	SLOAN	Nobody told me anything.
L62590	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
L62589	u452	m27	SLOAN	How was it?
L62951	u448	m27	MONA	"I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's ""LAUGH-IN."""
L62950	u439	m27	DELACROIX	David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
L62949	u439	m27	DELACROIX	This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
L62944	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Oh, is that what I'm doing?
L62943	u448	m27	MONA	I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
L62942	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Hi, Mona.
L62941	u448	m27	MONA	He, I'm Mona.
L62940	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Yes, your name?
L63562	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
L63561	u447	m27	MANTAN	My name is Manray, goddamnit.
L63560	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Mantan, we got a show to tape.
L63512	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
L63511	u447	m27	MANTAN	I don't believe it.
L63510	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
L63509	u447	m27	MANTAN	Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
L63508	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
L63507	u447	m27	MANTAN	What you did is dead wrong.
L63506	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
L63453	u439	m27	DELACROIX	And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
L63452	u447	m27	MANTAN	Yeah.
L63451	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
L63450	u447	m27	MANTAN	Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
L63449	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
L63448	u447	m27	MANTAN	No.
L63447	u439	m27	DELACROIX	What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
L63350	u439	m27	DELACROIX	In time.
L63349	u447	m27	MANTAN	Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
L63348	u439	m27	DELACROIX	No joke.  Serious.
L63345	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
L63344	u447	m27	MANTAN	Same thing Giuliani said.
L63343	u439	m27	DELACROIX	This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
L63342	u447	m27	MANTAN	You sound like the media.
L63341	u439	m27	DELACROIX	So they can be on TV.
L63032	u447	m27	MANTAN	Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
L63031	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Not nervous?  Relaxed?
L63030	u447	m27	MANTAN	I feel fine.
L63029	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You feel good, not nervous?
L63028	u447	m27	MANTAN	Naw.  I'll take the zero.
L63027	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Can I kiss you too?
L62889	u447	m27	MANTAN	The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
L62888	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
L62887	u447	m27	MANTAN	That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
L62886	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I didn't mean it to sound like that.
L62885	u447	m27	MANTAN	Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
L62884	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
L63545	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Soon.
L63544	u450	m27	ORCHID	I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
L63543	u439	m27	DELACROIX	If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
L63542	u450	m27	ORCHID	You know how your Daddy is.
L63541	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Not at all?
L63540	u450	m27	ORCHID	No.
L63539	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
L63538	u450	m27	ORCHID	Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
L63537	u439	m27	DELACROIX	You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
L63536	u450	m27	ORCHID	I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
L63118	u450	m27	ORCHID	Peerless, last time, go see your father.
L63117	u439	m27	DELACROIX	C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
L63116	u450	m27	ORCHID	Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
L63115	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
L63114	u450	m27	ORCHID	Regardless, he still is your father.
L63113	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
L63112	u450	m27	ORCHID	Richmond is not all the way down south.
L63111	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I can't go all the way down south.
L63110	u450	m27	ORCHID	He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
L63109	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Where is he?
L63108	u450	m27	ORCHID	Yes he did.
L63107	u439	m27	DELACROIX	He said that?
L63106	u450	m27	ORCHID	He wants you to come and see him.
L63099	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I'll be right over.
L63098	u450	m27	ORCHID	Peerless, your father called.
L62877	u450	m27	ORCHID	I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
L62876	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
L62875	u450	m27	ORCHID	Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
L62874	u439	m27	DELACROIX	To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
L62873	u450	m27	ORCHID	I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
L62872	u439	m27	DELACROIX	I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
L62871	u450	m27	ORCHID	Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
L62870	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Mommy, please don't call me that.
L62869	u450	m27	ORCHID	If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
L62868	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
L62867	u450	m27	ORCHID	That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
L62866	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
L62865	u450	m27	ORCHID	How's the food?
L62864	u450	m27	ORCHID	I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
L62863	u439	m27	DELACROIX	C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
L62862	u450	m27	ORCHID	You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
L62861	u439	m27	DELACROIX	It looks delicious.
L62860	u450	m27	ORCHID	You must think I'm some kind of fool.
L63049	u444	m27	JUKKA	Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
L63048	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
L63013	u439	m27	DELACROIX	This is a travesty.  A debacle.
L63012	u444	m27	JUKKA	Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
L63011	u439	m27	DELACROIX	This is a TV show, not a music video.
L63010	u444	m27	JUKKA	My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
L63009	u439	m27	DELACROIX	How did you get this gig?
L63008	u444	m27	JUKKA	Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
L63007	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
L63006	u444	m27	JUKKA	Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
L63005	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
L63004	u439	m27	DELACROIX	A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
L63003	u444	m27	JUKKA	What's a Negro.
L63002	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
L63001	u444	m27	JUKKA	You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
L63000	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Finland.
L62999	u444	m27	JUKKA	Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
L62998	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Where are you from?
L62995	u444	m27	JUKKA	I just turned twenty.
L62994	u439	m27	DELACROIX	Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
L63300	u449	m27	MYRNA	This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
L63299	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Yes you!
L63295	u449	m27	MYRNA	Thank you.  And always smile.
L63294	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Let Myrna finish.
L63289	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
L63288	u449	m27	MYRNA	"The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, ""F"" 'em."
L63282	u449	m27	MYRNA	The best defense is offense.
L63281	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
L63278	u449	m27	MYRNA	First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
L63277	u441	m27	DUNWITTY	I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
L62722	u452	m27	SLOAN	I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
L62721	u446	m27	MANRAY	I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
L62720	u452	m27	SLOAN	Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
L62719	u446	m27	MANRAY	You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
L62718	u452	m27	SLOAN	If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
L62717	u446	m27	MANRAY	I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
L62716	u452	m27	SLOAN	No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
L62715	u446	m27	MANRAY	Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
L62714	u452	m27	SLOAN	What do you mean?
L62713	u446	m27	MANRAY	So what's up with you and DeLa?
L62712	u452	m27	SLOAN	A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
L62711	u446	m27	MANRAY	You sing and dance?
L62710	u452	m27	SLOAN	I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
L62709	u446	m27	MANRAY	Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
L62708	u452	m27	SLOAN	You've never had any formal training, either?
L62707	u446	m27	MANRAY	I never had a really real pair before.
L63466	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 
L63465	u447	m27	MANTAN	I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
L63464	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
L63463	u447	m27	MANTAN	No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
L63462	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
L63461	u447	m27	MANTAN	Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
L63460	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	Money and nothing else?
L63459	u447	m27	MANTAN	"Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, ""it's all about the Benjamins."""
L63458	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
L63457	u447	m27	MANTAN	I'm more comfortable around my people.
L63456	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
L63455	u447	m27	MANTAN	Tavis, thank you for having me.
L63454	u453	m27	TAVIS SMILEY	Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
L63399	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	A song a comin' I feel.
L63398	u447	m27	MANTAN	I feel a song a comin' on.
L63396	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
L63395	u447	m27	MANTAN	Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
L63394	u447	m27	MANTAN	Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
L63393	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
L63392	u447	m27	MANTAN	I don't know who I am.
L63391	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	How be dat?
L63390	u447	m27	MANTAN	Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
L63389	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
L63388	u447	m27	MANTAN	Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
L63387	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
L63386	u447	m27	MANTAN	Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
L63385	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
L63384	u447	m27	MANTAN	I slept too near where I fell out.
L63383	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	You slept too near where you got in?
L63382	u447	m27	MANTAN	I fell out of my bed last night.
L63239	u447	m27	MANTAN	...like fried and chicken...
L63238	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	...like grits and butter...
L63237	u447	m27	MANTAN	...like macaroni and cheese...
L63236	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
L63235	u447	m27	MANTAN	...perfect...
L63234	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	...too late, maybe around...

L63229	u447	m27	MANTAN	...not that time...
L63228	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	...I heard different, thought that was...
L63227	u447	m27	MANTAN	...yes she did.
L63226	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	...no, she didn't...
L63225	u447	m27	MANTAN	Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
L63224	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
L63223	u447	m27	MANTAN	I heard ya lady is wild.
L63222	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	We should go out on a double date.
L63221	u447	m27	MANTAN	I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
L63220	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	...aconite get it dat cheap.
L63219	u447	m27	MANTAN	...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
L63218	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
L63217	u447	m27	MANTAN	I thought you got rid of...
L63216	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
L63215	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
L63214	u447	m27	MANTAN	...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
L63213	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
L63212	u447	m27	MANTAN	Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
L63211	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
L63210	u447	m27	MANTAN	She hates dem.
L63209	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	No, not that.  How 'bout...
L63208	u447	m27	MANTAN	Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
L63207	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Oh her.

L63205	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	The one with da big...
L63204	u447	m27	MANTAN	Y'know my lady Lucindy?
L63088	u447	m27	MANTAN	Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
L63087	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	You tellin' the truth.
L63086	u447	m27	MANTAN	Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
L63084	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
L63083	u447	m27	MANTAN	Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
L63082	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
L63081	u447	m27	MANTAN	"No mo' ""city slickers.""  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?"
L63080	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
L63079	u447	m27	MANTAN	To come back to our roots.
L63078	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	...the big apple, New York, New York.
L63077	u447	m27	MANTAN	We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
L63075	u451	m27	SLEEP 'N EAT	And this is my very best friend Mantan.
L63074	u447	m27	MANTAN	This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
L63533	u447	m27	MANTAN	I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
L63532	u452	m27	SLOAN	You can go now.
L63531	u447	m27	MANTAN	I know I won't be your puppet.
L63530	u452	m27	SLOAN	Why don't you answer?
L63529	u447	m27	MANTAN	Don't try to change to the subject.
L63528	u452	m27	SLOAN	Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
L63527	u447	m27	MANTAN	"So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like ""IHOP.""  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass."
L63526	u452	m27	SLOAN	That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
L63525	u447	m27	MANTAN	Aw, c'mon.
L63524	u452	m27	SLOAN	We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
L63523	u447	m27	MANTAN	Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
L63522	u452	m27	SLOAN	Say what, Manray?
L63521	u447	m27	MANTAN	Oh, you gonna make me say it.
L63520	u452	m27	SLOAN	Just ask me what you want to know.
L63519	u447	m27	MANTAN	Stop playing me Sloan.
L63518	u452	m27	SLOAN	And what?
L63517	u447	m27	MANTAN	And?
L63516	u452	m27	SLOAN	After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
L63515	u447	m27	MANTAN	You leave something out?
L63514	u452	m27	SLOAN	Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
L63513	u447	m27	MANTAN	How did you get this gig?
L63441	u447	m27	MANTAN	You look beautiful like that.
L63440	u452	m27	SLOAN	What?
L63439	u447	m27	MANTAN	Y'know what?
L63438	u452	m27	SLOAN	I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
L63436	u447	m27	MANTAN	My people love me.
L63435	u452	m27	SLOAN	You're sure this is a good idea.
L63434	u447	m27	MANTAN	For what?  He left.  Not me.
L63433	u452	m27	SLOAN	Why don't you call him?
L63380	u447	m27	MANTAN	We can look out for ourselves.
L63379	u452	m27	SLOAN	I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
L63378	u447	m27	MANTAN	Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
L63377	u452	m27	SLOAN	Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
L63376	u447	m27	MANTAN	Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
L63375	u452	m27	SLOAN	Maybe you need to start.
L63374	u447	m27	MANTAN	Never read a book in my whole life.
L63373	u452	m27	SLOAN	You don't read, do you?
L63372	u447	m27	MANTAN	No, before my time.
L63371	u452	m27	SLOAN	Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
L63370	u447	m27	MANTAN	Gots no intention of ending up broke.
L63369	u452	m27	SLOAN	I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
L63368	u447	m27	MANTAN	Just a little something' somethin'.
L63367	u452	m27	SLOAN	Oh you do, huh?
L63366	u447	m27	MANTAN	Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
L63365	u452	m27	SLOAN	This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
L63105	u452	m27	SLOAN	Are you trying to rap to me?
L63104	u447	m27	MANTAN	What else?
L63103	u452	m27	SLOAN	I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
L63102	u447	m27	MANTAN	The good stuff.
L63101	u452	m27	SLOAN	What do you want to know?
L63100	u447	m27	MANTAN	So what's up with you?
L62904	u452	m27	SLOAN	Enough.
L62903	u447	m27	MANTAN	A lot?
L62883	u447	m27	MANTAN	Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
L62882	u452	m27	SLOAN	People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
L163309	u761	m49	AMANDA	I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
L163308	u765	m49	HAWK	Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
L163270	u765	m49	HAWK	Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
L163269	u761	m49	AMANDA	He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
L163268	u765	m49	HAWK	And he loves you back, doesn't he?
L163267	u761	m49	AMANDA	More than anything in the world.
L163266	u765	m49	HAWK	No, I mean... you love your son?
L163265	u761	m49	AMANDA	I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
L163264	u765	m49	HAWK	You love him?
L163263	u761	m49	AMANDA	Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
L163262	u765	m49	HAWK	Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
L163259	u765	m49	HAWK	My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
L163258	u761	m49	AMANDA	Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
L163257	u765	m49	HAWK	Who's Whiskey Dick?
L163256	u761	m49	AMANDA	Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
L163255	u765	m49	HAWK	Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
L163254	u761	m49	AMANDA	Gin.
L163253	u765	m49	HAWK	What the hell is that?
L163191	u761	m49	AMANDA	I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
L163190	u765	m49	HAWK	Huh?
L163189	u761	m49	AMANDA	Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
L163188	u765	m49	HAWK	Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
L163187	u761	m49	AMANDA	You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
L163186	u765	m49	HAWK	Thanks, miss.
L163145	u762	m49	BARTENDER	Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
L163144	u765	m49	HAWK	I-I c-can't...
L163143	u762	m49	BARTENDER	You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
L163142	u765	m49	HAWK	Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
L163089	u762	m49	BARTENDER	Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
L163088	u765	m49	HAWK	Whoa... she is a killer.
L163087	u762	m49	BARTENDER	Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
L163086	u765	m49	HAWK	Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
L163085	u762	m49	BARTENDER	You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
L163084	u765	m49	HAWK	What's that?
L163081	u765	m49	HAWK	Yeah, a man's drink...
L163080	u762	m49	BARTENDER	You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
L163079	u765	m49	HAWK	Got any KISS?
L163078	u762	m49	BARTENDER	Pick a song, Hawk.
L163077	u765	m49	HAWK	Hawk.
L163076	u762	m49	BARTENDER	You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
L163307	u766	m49	JAM	Bye.
L163306	u763	m49	BETH	Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
L163305	u766	m49	JAM	Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
L163304	u763	m49	BETH	Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
L163303	u766	m49	JAM	I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
L163302	u763	m49	BETH	That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
L163301	u766	m49	JAM	Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
L163300	u763	m49	BETH	Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
L163221	u763	m49	BETH	My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
L163220	u766	m49	JAM	Ann Arbor?
L163219	u763	m49	BETH	I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
L163218	u766	m49	JAM	Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
L163217	u763	m49	BETH	Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
L163216	u766	m49	JAM	I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
L163215	u763	m49	BETH	So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
L163182	u763	m49	BETH	Oh, screw it!
L163181	u766	m49	JAM	Right, slow...
L163180	u763	m49	BETH	We've got to take this slow...
L163179	u763	m49	BETH	You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
L163178	u766	m49	JAM	Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
L163177	u763	m49	BETH	I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
L163176	u766	m49	JAM	I don't care. I wanna hear more.
L163175	u763	m49	BETH	I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
L163172	u763	m49	BETH	Believe it.
L163171	u766	m49	JAM	Beth? I can't believe it.
L162700	u766	m49	JAM	Yeah?
L162699	u763	m49	BETH	Jeremiah?
L162698	u766	m49	JAM	It's okay.
L162697	u763	m49	BETH	Sorry.
L162690	u766	m49	JAM	Thanks.
L162689	u763	m49	BETH	No problem.
L162945	u775	m49	TRIP	Whatever... stella.
L162944	u764	m49	CHRISTINE	Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
L162943	u775	m49	TRIP	You got in the car, didn't you?
L162942	u764	m49	CHRISTINE	Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
L162939	u764	m49	CHRISTINE	What? That's disgusting!
L162938	u775	m49	TRIP	So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
L162933	u764	m49	CHRISTINE	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
L162932	u775	m49	TRIP	What's it worth to you?
L162931	u764	m49	CHRISTINE	Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
L163339	u775	m49	TRIP	Plenty, but it was all bad.
L163338	u765	m49	HAWK	Any luck?
L163034	u765	m49	HAWK	For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
L163033	u775	m49	TRIP	One more time in English.
L163032	u765	m49	HAWK	...at twenty-thirty hours.
L163027	u765	m49	HAWK	Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
L163026	u775	m49	TRIP	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
L163025	u765	m49	HAWK	So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
L162998	u775	m49	TRIP	Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
L162997	u765	m49	HAWK	I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
L162971	u775	m49	TRIP	Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
L162970	u765	m49	HAWK	What was that D.J.'s name again?
L162953	u775	m49	TRIP	Disco blows dogs for quarters.
L162952	u765	m49	HAWK	You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
L162864	u775	m49	TRIP	Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
L162863	u765	m49	HAWK	What's in Sandusky?
L162862	u775	m49	TRIP	Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
L162861	u765	m49	HAWK	Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
L162860	u775	m49	TRIP	I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
L162791	u765	m49	HAWK	I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
L162790	u775	m49	TRIP	Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
L162789	u765	m49	HAWK	Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
L162775	u765	m49	HAWK	"Our band ""Mystery"" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere."
L162774	u775	m49	TRIP	Namely?
L162770	u765	m49	HAWK	Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
L162769	u775	m49	TRIP	This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
L162750	u765	m49	HAWK	Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
L162749	u775	m49	TRIP	Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
L162721	u765	m49	HAWK	For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
L162720	u775	m49	TRIP	Yeah.
L162719	u765	m49	HAWK	What are you, high?
L163346	u765	m49	HAWK	Nah. Couldn't be.
L163345	u768	m49	LEX	No... You don't think...?
L163341	u765	m49	HAWK	Tickets?
L163340	u768	m49	LEX	I found the Volvo.
L163031	u765	m49	HAWK	Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
L163030	u768	m49	LEX	"Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all ""re-enter"" the concerto. Voila!"
L163029	u765	m49	HAWK	Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
L163028	u768	m49	LEX	I think we should try sneaking in.
L163020	u765	m49	HAWK	Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
L163019	u768	m49	LEX	...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
L163018	u765	m49	HAWK	Cool, bro, now listen up...
L163017	u768	m49	LEX	...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
L163016	u765	m49	HAWK	Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
L163015	u765	m49	HAWK	Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
L163014	u768	m49	LEX	Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
L163003	u768	m49	LEX	DUDES!
L163002	u765	m49	HAWK	Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
L163001	u768	m49	LEX	Uh... dudes?
L162875	u768	m49	LEX	The paint!
L162874	u765	m49	HAWK	What the fuck!
L162859	u765	m49	HAWK	Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
L162858	u768	m49	LEX	Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
L162855	u765	m49	HAWK	Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
L162854	u768	m49	LEX	We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
L162820	u765	m49	HAWK	Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
L162819	u768	m49	LEX	Now, how are we gonna do this?
L162795	u768	m49	LEX	Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
L162794	u765	m49	HAWK	Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
L162793	u765	m49	HAWK	Curly.
L162792	u768	m49	LEX	Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
L162788	u765	m49	HAWK	Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
L162787	u768	m49	LEX	The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
L162786	u765	m49	HAWK	There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
L162783	u765	m49	HAWK	Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
L162782	u768	m49	LEX	Sunday, but...
L162781	u765	m49	HAWK	And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
L162780	u768	m49	LEX	Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
L162779	u765	m49	HAWK	Damn straight we are.
L162778	u768	m49	LEX	We are not stealing my mom's car.
L162777	u765	m49	HAWK	So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
L162776	u768	m49	LEX	But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
L162754	u765	m49	HAWK	Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
L162753	u768	m49	LEX	Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
L162740	u765	m49	HAWK	Weird...
L162739	u768	m49	LEX	I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
L162738	u765	m49	HAWK	Whoa... she just farted.
L162737	u768	m49	LEX	I've been in love with her since the second grade.
L162736	u765	m49	HAWK	That's Sherry VanHafton.
L162726	u768	m49	LEX	Check!
L162725	u765	m49	HAWK	Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
L162678	u765	m49	HAWK	Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
L162677	u768	m49	LEX	Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
L162674	u765	m49	HAWK	YO, DOOFUS!
L162673	u768	m49	LEX	Shit, that dork is Jam.
L162667	u768	m49	LEX	Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
L162666	u765	m49	HAWK	Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
L162915	u767	m49	KENNY	Sure.
L162914	u765	m49	HAWK	How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
L162908	u767	m49	KENNY	Oh, yeah...?
L162907	u765	m49	HAWK	Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
L162906	u767	m49	KENNY	Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
L162905	u765	m49	HAWK	Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
L162892	u765	m49	HAWK	No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
L162891	u767	m49	KENNY	Are you gettin' wise with me?
L162882	u767	m49	KENNY	And if it ain't cleaned off?
L162881	u765	m49	HAWK	Could be.
L162877	u765	m49	HAWK	Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
L162876	u767	m49	KENNY	Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
L163069	u773	m49	SCALPER	Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
L163068	u765	m49	HAWK	Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
L163067	u773	m49	SCALPER	Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
L163066	u765	m49	HAWK	Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
L163065	u773	m49	SCALPER	Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
L163064	u765	m49	HAWK	I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
L163063	u773	m49	SCALPER	You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
L163062	u773	m49	SCALPER	The easy way.
L163061	u765	m49	HAWK	Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
L163060	u773	m49	SCALPER	Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
L163059	u765	m49	HAWK	Dude, this is all I got.
L163357	u766	m49	JAM	We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
L163356	u765	m49	HAWK	Go ahead, Jam.
L163355	u766	m49	JAM	Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
L163038	u765	m49	HAWK	See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
L163037	u766	m49	JAM	But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
L163036	u765	m49	HAWK	Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
L163035	u766	m49	JAM	Wait! I know how we can get in!
L163024	u765	m49	HAWK	Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
L163023	u766	m49	JAM	I got...
L163013	u765	m49	HAWK	Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
L163012	u766	m49	JAM	I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
L163008	u765	m49	HAWK	Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
L163007	u766	m49	JAM	It was stolen!
L162995	u765	m49	HAWK	Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
L162994	u766	m49	JAM	Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
L162993	u765	m49	HAWK	Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
L162969	u766	m49	JAM	Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
L162968	u765	m49	HAWK	Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
L162935	u765	m49	HAWK	Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
L162934	u766	m49	JAM	It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
L162926	u766	m49	JAM	Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
L162925	u765	m49	HAWK	Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
L162873	u765	m49	HAWK	What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
L162872	u766	m49	JAM	Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
L162831	u766	m49	JAM	Check.
L162830	u765	m49	HAWK	If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
L162686	u766	m49	JAM	Check.
L162685	u765	m49	HAWK	All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
L162684	u766	m49	JAM	Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
L162681	u766	m49	JAM	She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
L162680	u765	m49	HAWK	They're what?
L162679	u766	m49	JAM	They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
L162642	u766	m49	JAM	Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
L162641	u765	m49	HAWK	Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
L162640	u766	m49	JAM	I'm really sorry about that, man.
L162639	u765	m49	HAWK	Cool.
L162635	u765	m49	HAWK	Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
L162634	u766	m49	JAM	Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
L162633	u765	m49	HAWK	The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
L162632	u766	m49	JAM	What's gone?
L162631	u765	m49	HAWK	Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
L162630	u766	m49	JAM	It's my Bullworker.
L162629	u765	m49	HAWK	Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
L162628	u765	m49	HAWK	Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
L162627	u766	m49	JAM	Hawk?
L162626	u765	m49	HAWK	Jam, listen up.
L163334	u766	m49	JAM	I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
L163333	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
L163043	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
L163042	u766	m49	JAM	Mom, what're we...?
L162747	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
L162746	u766	m49	JAM	I said, I'm sorry!
L162745	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	What?!
L162744	u766	m49	JAM	If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
L162743	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
L162713	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
L162712	u766	m49	JAM	You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
L162711	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
L162664	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
L162663	u766	m49	JAM	Grounded for the rest of the year?
L162662	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
L162661	u766	m49	JAM	They're not idiots.
L162659	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
L162658	u766	m49	JAM	But, mom!
L162657	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
L162656	u766	m49	JAM	Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
L162655	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
L162654	u766	m49	JAM	Ahh, sunshine.
L162653	u766	m49	JAM	Uhh... nothing.
L162652	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	Jeremiah, what are you doing?
L162619	u771	m49	MRS. BRUCE	NOW!
L162618	u766	m49	JAM	Oh, hi, mom.
L163235	u772	m49	PRIEST	Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
L163234	u766	m49	JAM	Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
L163233	u772	m49	PRIEST	A bustier?
L163232	u766	m49	JAM	No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
L163231	u772	m49	PRIEST	Was it a teddy?
L163230	u766	m49	JAM	Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
L163229	u772	m49	PRIEST	Well? Continue! Continue!
L163228	u766	m49	JAM	Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
L163227	u772	m49	PRIEST	Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
L163226	u766	m49	JAM	I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
L163225	u772	m49	PRIEST	No...
L163224	u766	m49	JAM	Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
L163223	u772	m49	PRIEST	Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
L163170	u772	m49	PRIEST	Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
L163169	u766	m49	JAM	No.
L163168	u772	m49	PRIEST	Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
L163167	u766	m49	JAM	Yeah.
L163166	u772	m49	PRIEST	That's it?
L163165	u766	m49	JAM	So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
L163139	u766	m49	JAM	Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
L163138	u772	m49	PRIEST	Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
L163137	u766	m49	JAM	Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
L163022	u768	m49	LEX	All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
L163021	u775	m49	TRIP	Twenty-five more'n I got.
L163011	u768	m49	LEX	Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
L163010	u775	m49	TRIP	Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
L163009	u768	m49	LEX	But we took the keys?
L163006	u768	m49	LEX	I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
L163005	u775	m49	TRIP	It's gone.
L162992	u775	m49	TRIP	Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
L162991	u768	m49	LEX	Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
L162963	u775	m49	TRIP	Let's lift up her shirt.
L162962	u768	m49	LEX	Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
L162867	u768	m49	LEX	Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
L162866	u775	m49	TRIP	Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
L162812	u768	m49	LEX	Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
L162811	u775	m49	TRIP	Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
L162797	u768	m49	LEX	Hello summer detention.
L162796	u775	m49	TRIP	About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
L162785	u768	m49	LEX	Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
L162784	u775	m49	TRIP	Simplicity, Hawk.
L162772	u775	m49	TRIP	"Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, ""Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole."" We're going this time and that's all there is to it."
L162771	u768	m49	LEX	"The Chinese have a proverb: ""That which appears too good to be true, usually is."" There's gotta be a catch."
L162767	u768	m49	LEX	We won?!
L162766	u775	m49	TRIP	I did it! I did it! We won!
L162733	u768	m49	LEX	Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
L162732	u775	m49	TRIP	Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
L162731	u768	m49	LEX	Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
L162730	u775	m49	TRIP	Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
L162729	u768	m49	LEX	Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
L162718	u775	m49	TRIP	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
L162717	u768	m49	LEX	I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
L162683	u768	m49	LEX	If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
L162682	u775	m49	TRIP	That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
L162671	u775	m49	TRIP	You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
L162670	u768	m49	LEX	Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
L162650	u775	m49	TRIP	What?
L162649	u768	m49	LEX	Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
L162646	u775	m49	TRIP	Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
L162645	u768	m49	LEX	Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
L162644	u775	m49	TRIP	You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
L162643	u768	m49	LEX	Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
L162623	u768	m49	LEX	I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
L162622	u775	m49	TRIP	Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
L163153	u775	m49	TRIP	Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
L163152	u769	m49	LITTLE KID	You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
L163151	u775	m49	TRIP	Two hundred bucks?
L163116	u769	m49	LITTLE KID	Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
L163115	u775	m49	TRIP	Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
L163109	u769	m49	LITTLE KID	It's not nearly enough, punk.
L163108	u775	m49	TRIP	Look, you can have my wallet...
L163107	u769	m49	LITTLE KID	A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
L163106	u775	m49	TRIP	What do you want?
L163105	u769	m49	LITTLE KID	Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
L163104	u775	m49	TRIP	Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
L163102	u769	m49	LITTLE KID	No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
L163101	u775	m49	TRIP	A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
L163100	u769	m49	LITTLE KID	Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
L163278	u775	m49	TRIP	Neither do I!
L163277	u770	m49	MAN WITH COAT	I don't even think you have a gun!
L163276	u775	m49	TRIP	Not if I shoot first!
L163275	u770	m49	MAN WITH COAT	Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
L163274	u775	m49	TRIP	No, you gimme your gun, boy!
L163273	u770	m49	MAN WITH COAT	Gimme your gun, boy!
L163208	u775	m49	TRIP	The KISS Army!
L163207	u770	m49	MAN WITH COAT	Oh, yeah! You and what army?
L162986	u774	m49	SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	"Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not ""Taxi Driver."" Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and..."
L162985	u776	m49	TRIP'S VOICE	Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
L162984	u774	m49	SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Yeah, you did!
L162983	u776	m49	TRIP'S VOICE	I did?
L162982	u774	m49	SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
L162981	u776	m49	TRIP'S VOICE	Yeah.
L162980	u774	m49	SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Is that your final answer?
L162979	u776	m49	TRIP'S VOICE	Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
L162978	u774	m49	SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
L162977	u776	m49	TRIP'S VOICE	Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
L162976	u774	m49	SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
L279684	u1323	m88	ROB	Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
L279683	u1312	m88	ALISON'S MOM	I beg your pardon?
L279682	u1323	m88	ROB	Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
L279681	u1312	m88	ALISON'S MOM	That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
L279680	u1323	m88	ROB	You gotta be kidding me.
L279679	u1312	m88	ALISON'S MOM	I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
L279678	u1323	m88	ROB	Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
L279677	u1323	m88	ROB	Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
L279676	u1312	m88	ALISON'S MOM	Really.
L279675	u1323	m88	ROB	Alison's.
L279673	u1312	m88	ALISON'S MOM	I don't know.
L279672	u1323	m88	ROB	Do I know you?
L280038	u1313	m88	BARRY	That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
L280037	u1323	m88	ROB	You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
L280036	u1313	m88	BARRY	I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
L280035	u1323	m88	ROB	Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
L280034	u1313	m88	BARRY	What do you think?  Dick likes it.
L280033	u1323	m88	ROB	Sonic Death Monkey.
L280032	u1313	m88	BARRY	We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
L280031	u1323	m88	ROB	You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
L280030	u1313	m88	BARRY	We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
L280029	u1323	m88	ROB	110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
L280028	u1313	m88	BARRY	No.  We need the gig.
L280027	u1323	m88	ROB	What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
L280026	u1313	m88	BARRY	We're getting that anyway.
L280025	u1323	m88	ROB	I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
L280024	u1313	m88	BARRY	Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
L280023	u1323	m88	ROB	Like fuck you are.
L279983	u1313	m88	BARRY	HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
L279982	u1323	m88	ROB	So?  You even said they're good.
L279981	u1313	m88	BARRY	"I heard you, man.  Don't give me that ""what"" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them."
L279980	u1323	m88	ROB	What?
L279979	u1313	m88	BARRY	What the fuck is that?
L279964	u1313	m88	BARRY	Yes way.  It's really...
L279963	u1323	m88	ROB	No way.
L279962	u1313	m88	BARRY	The little skate-fuckers.
L279835	u1323	m88	ROB	Not really.
L279834	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
L279833	u1323	m88	ROB	Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
L279832	u1313	m88	BARRY	Haven't seen it.
L279831	u1323	m88	ROB	Because it's in The Big Chill.
L279830	u1313	m88	BARRY	"I'd want ""One Step Beyond"" by Madness. And ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."""
L279829	u1323	m88	ROB	Fuck off, Barry.
L279828	u1313	m88	BARRY	"Whatever.  Okay. ""Tell Laura I Love Her."" That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it."
L279827	u1323	m88	ROB	It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
L279820	u1313	m88	BARRY	Ooh.  Drag.
L279819	u1323	m88	ROB	Laura.  Her dad died.
L279818	u1313	m88	BARRY	What's up?
L279768	u1323	m88	ROB	Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
L279767	u1313	m88	BARRY	So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
L279766	u1323	m88	ROB	Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
L279765	u1313	m88	BARRY	You're not even coming?
L279764	u1323	m88	ROB	None.  Christ!
L279763	u1313	m88	BARRY	How many tickets can I put you down for?
L279762	u1323	m88	ROB	Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
L279761	u1313	m88	BARRY	That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
L279760	u1323	m88	ROB	Isn't it?
L279759	u1323	m88	ROB	That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
L279758	u1313	m88	BARRY	They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
L279757	u1323	m88	ROB	You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
L279756	u1313	m88	BARRY	I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
L279755	u1323	m88	ROB	Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
L279754	u1313	m88	BARRY	Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
L279753	u1323	m88	ROB	You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
L279752	u1313	m88	BARRY	The band that found me and asked me to join.
L279751	u1323	m88	ROB	What band?
L279750	u1313	m88	BARRY	My band.
L279749	u1323	m88	ROB	What the fuck is that?
L279748	u1313	m88	BARRY	Hey.
L279617	u1323	m88	ROB	Terrific.
L279616	u1313	m88	BARRY	Suck my ass.
L279615	u1323	m88	ROB	Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
L279614	u1313	m88	BARRY	Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
L279613	u1323	m88	ROB	Shut the fuck up, Barry.
L279608	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
L279607	u1323	m88	ROB	How do you know about that?
L279606	u1313	m88	BARRY	Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
L279600	u1323	m88	ROB	Ha.
L279599	u1313	m88	BARRY	Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
L279598	u1323	m88	ROB	Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
L279597	u1313	m88	BARRY	I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
L279596	u1313	m88	BARRY	Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
L279595	u1323	m88	ROB	Why would they care?
L279594	u1313	m88	BARRY	How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
L279593	u1323	m88	ROB	But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
L279592	u1313	m88	BARRY	"...But the word ""yet..."" Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to."
L279591	u1313	m88	BARRY	Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
L279590	u1323	m88	ROB	Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
L279589	u1313	m88	BARRY	-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, yeah, yeah, I hear you --
L279588	u1323	m88	ROB	Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
L279587	u1313	m88	BARRY	I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
L279586	u1323	m88	ROB	No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
L279585	u1313	m88	BARRY	I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
L279584	u1323	m88	ROB	"Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, ""I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,"" what would you think?"
L279583	u1313	m88	BARRY	To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
L279582	u1323	m88	ROB	"Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? ""I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"""
L279581	u1323	m88	ROB	-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
L279580	u1313	m88	BARRY	-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
L279579	u1323	m88	ROB	"There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does ""yet"" mean, anyway?  ""I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet."" What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?"
L279569	u1313	m88	BARRY	"Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! ""Let's Get It On?"" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?"
L279568	u1323	m88	ROB	"Shut up. ""Let's Get It On,"" Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. ""Airbag,"" Radiohead, from OK Computer."
L279567	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
L279566	u1323	m88	ROB	"Thunder Road, Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" Nirvana, Nevermind."
L279565	u1313	m88	BARRY	Ehh.
L279564	u1323	m88	ROB	"Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... ""Janie Jones,"" the Clash, from The Clash."
L279420	u1313	m88	BARRY	What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
L279419	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
L279418	u1313	m88	BARRY	What are you snickering about?
L279417	u1323	m88	ROB	"What do you mean, ""what?"""
L279416	u1313	m88	BARRY	What?
L279317	u1323	m88	ROB	It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
L279316	u1313	m88	BARRY	We can take your car.
L279315	u1323	m88	ROB	That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
L279314	u1313	m88	BARRY	We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
L279293	u1313	m88	BARRY	I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
L279292	u1323	m88	ROB	What did you tell her about the shop for?
L279270	u1313	m88	BARRY	...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
L279269	u1323	m88	ROB	I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
L279268	u1313	m88	BARRY	I wanna date a musician...
L279261	u1323	m88	ROB	But now I kind of like it.
L279260	u1313	m88	BARRY	Yeah.
L279194	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
L279193	u1323	m88	ROB	It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
L279192	u1313	m88	BARRY	He offended me with his terrible taste.
L279191	u1323	m88	ROB	What did he ever do to you?
L279190	u1313	m88	BARRY	Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
L279189	u1323	m88	ROB	Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
L279188	u1313	m88	BARRY	Our customers? You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
L279187	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
L279186	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh, so what's the point then?
L279185	u1323	m88	ROB	Not the point.
L279184	u1313	m88	BARRY	"We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is ""Don't Drive Drunk."" I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny."
L279183	u1323	m88	ROB	You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
L279182	u1313	m88	BARRY	"Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  ""Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"""
L279181	u1323	m88	ROB	Nice, Barry.
L279160	u1313	m88	BARRY	Well what's the point in that?
L279159	u1323	m88	ROB	We'll do it next Monday.
L279158	u1313	m88	BARRY	Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
L279157	u1323	m88	ROB	Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
L279156	u1313	m88	BARRY	Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
L279155	u1323	m88	ROB	How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
L279146	u1313	m88	BARRY	Little Latin Lupe Lu.
L279145	u1323	m88	ROB	Say it.
L279144	u1313	m88	BARRY	Play it.
L279143	u1323	m88	ROB	What's next?
L279142	u1313	m88	BARRY	Don't you want to hear what's next?
L279141	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
L279140	u1313	m88	BARRY	But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
L279139	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
L279138	u1313	m88	BARRY	Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
L279137	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
L279136	u1313	m88	BARRY	What are you doing?
L279135	u1313	m88	BARRY	IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
L279134	u1323	m88	ROB	TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
L279388	u1313	m88	BARRY	NO--!
L279387	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	I have a television.
L279386	u1313	m88	BARRY	That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
L279378	u1313	m88	BARRY	Do not get ahead of yourself.
L279377	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	Well what about the new Echo --
L279376	u1313	m88	BARRY	They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
L279375	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	They always seemed...
L279374	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
L279373	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	I have all of the others.
L279372	u1313	m88	BARRY	It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
L279177	u1313	m88	BARRY	Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
L279176	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
L279175	u1313	m88	BARRY	"Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells ""I Just Called To Say I Loved You?"" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time."
L279174	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	Why not?
L279173	u1313	m88	BARRY	No, you can't.
L279172	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	Great.  Can I have it then?
L279171	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh yeah.  We got it.
L279170	u1316	m88	CUSTOMER	"I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  ""I Just Called To Say I Love You."" Do you have it?"
L279826	u1313	m88	BARRY	-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
L279825	u1317	m88	DICK	Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
L279824	u1313	m88	BARRY	"Okay, okay -- ""Leader of the Pack."" The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? ""Dead Man's Curve,"" Jan and Dean..."
L279722	u1313	m88	BARRY	He's not worth it!
L279721	u1317	m88	DICK	Don't do it, Rob!
L279612	u1313	m88	BARRY	Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
L279611	u1317	m88	DICK	Anna Moss.
L279610	u1313	m88	BARRY	Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
L279609	u1317	m88	DICK	Anna.
L279604	u1317	m88	DICK	Nobody.
L279603	u1313	m88	BARRY	Who are you going to see?
L279602	u1313	m88	BARRY	Why?
L279601	u1317	m88	DICK	I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
L279288	u1317	m88	DICK	You'd love it!
L279287	u1313	m88	BARRY	We work there!
L279286	u1317	m88	DICK	A couple blocks!  About six!
L279285	u1313	m88	BARRY	On Clark Street!
L279284	u1317	m88	DICK	He's got one!
L279267	u1313	m88	BARRY	You can be and are wrong.
L279266	u1317	m88	DICK	"It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a ""The.""  But I could be wrong."
L279265	u1313	m88	BARRY	"No, no, no, you said ""The Number Four With a Smile,"" and there's no ""The"" at the front of the title of the album."
L279264	u1317	m88	DICK	That's what I said.
L279263	u1313	m88	BARRY	"Isn't her album called ""Number Four With A Smile?"""
L279262	u1317	m88	DICK	"She shouldn't done it on ""The Number Four With a Smile."""
L279154	u1313	m88	BARRY	Bullshit.
L279153	u1317	m88	DICK	Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
L279152	u1313	m88	BARRY	No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
L279151	u1317	m88	DICK	Nothing.
L279150	u1313	m88	BARRY	What?
L279149	u1317	m88	DICK	Oh well.  Nevermind.
L279148	u1313	m88	BARRY	No.  The Righteous Brothers.
L279147	u1317	m88	DICK	Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
L279130	u1317	m88	DICK	It's the new --
L279129	u1313	m88	BARRY	Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
L279989	u1313	m88	BARRY	Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
L279988	u1319	m88	LAURA	What are you talking about?
L279987	u1313	m88	BARRY	The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
L279986	u1319	m88	LAURA	Where's Rob?
L279985	u1313	m88	BARRY	Oh, hi.
L279984	u1319	m88	LAURA	Hey, Barry.
L279844	u1319	m88	LAURA	No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
L279843	u1313	m88	BARRY	"Somebody's Gonna Die by Blitz. ""Bella Lugosi's Dead,"" Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling."
L280091	u1323	m88	ROB	Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
L280090	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
L280089	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
L280088	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
L280087	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
L280086	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	"Okay. ""Dance Music For Old People?"""
L280085	u1323	m88	ROB	"Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like ""the Upsetter"" by Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, in there.  Instead of ""Sin City."""
L280084	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Music for Old People. What does that mean?
L280083	u1323	m88	ROB	Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
L280082	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	What's his name?
L280081	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.
L280080	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Nice friend.
L280079	u1323	m88	ROB	Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
L280078	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
L280077	u1323	m88	ROB	Sure, but is that it for the list?
L280076	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
L280075	u1323	m88	ROB	Is that it?
L280074	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Fine.  That's great.
L280073	u1323	m88	ROB	"Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... ""Sin City."" ""New Rose,"" by The Damned. ""Hit It and Quit It"" by Funkadelic. ""Shipbuilding,"" Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... ""Mystery Train"" by Elvis Presley... And... ""Spaced Cowboy"" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but..."
L280072	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
L280071	u1323	m88	ROB	Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
L280070	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	"Well if one of them is this ""Sin City"" thing --"
L280069	u1323	m88	ROB	What do you mean, four more?
L280068	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
L280067	u1323	m88	ROB	"OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. ""Sin City"" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home."
L280066	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Is there a difference?
L280065	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
L280064	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Your desert island top-five.
L280063	u1323	m88	ROB	Pardon me?
L280062	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
L280061	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
L280060	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
L280059	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	So.  Is now a good time?
L280058	u1323	m88	ROB	What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
L280057	u1323	m88	ROB	Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
L280056	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
L280055	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh.  Okay.
L280054	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
L280053	u1323	m88	ROB	Right.  Why?
L280052	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
L280051	u1323	m88	ROB	Uh.  That's me.
L280050	u1314	m88	CAROLINE	I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
L280049	u1323	m88	ROB	May I help you?
L279746	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
L279745	u1323	m88	ROB	Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
L279744	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
L279743	u1323	m88	ROB	C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
L279742	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
L279741	u1323	m88	ROB	Huh?
L279740	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
L279739	u1323	m88	ROB	Why did you break up with me for Marco?
L279738	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	Hey Rob.
L279737	u1323	m88	ROB	Hey Charlie.
L279736	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
L279735	u1323	m88	ROB	Uh...yes, at the moment.
L279734	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
L279733	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
L279732	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
L279731	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah, sure...
L279730	u1315	m88	CHARLIE	Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
L279961	u1323	m88	ROB	Who's that?
L279960	u1317	m88	DICK	It's Vince and Justin.
L279959	u1323	m88	ROB	What is this.
L279842	u1317	m88	DICK	Abraham, Martin, and John. That's a nice one.
L279841	u1323	m88	ROB	Can I do anything?
L279822	u1323	m88	ROB	You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
L279821	u1317	m88	DICK	I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
L279619	u1317	m88	DICK	Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
L279618	u1323	m88	ROB	Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
L279422	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
L279421	u1317	m88	DICK	Well we rang $900 today.
L279390	u1317	m88	DICK	Do it.  Do it.
L279389	u1323	m88	ROB	I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
L279313	u1323	m88	ROB	-- FUCK OFF!
L279312	u1317	m88	DICK	Rob --!
L279305	u1317	m88	DICK	Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
L279304	u1323	m88	ROB	Liz, hold on a second --  What?
L279303	u1317	m88	DICK	Rob.
L279275	u1317	m88	DICK	I want a tape.
L279274	u1323	m88	ROB	Let's not.
L279259	u1317	m88	DICK	Yeah.
L279258	u1323	m88	ROB	I always hated this song.
L279206	u1317	m88	DICK	Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
L279205	u1323	m88	ROB	I understand, Dick.
L279204	u1317	m88	DICK	Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
L279203	u1317	m88	DICK	I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
L279202	u1323	m88	ROB	Fine.
L279201	u1317	m88	DICK	I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
L279200	u1317	m88	DICK	'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
L279199	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
L279198	u1317	m88	DICK	Are you all right?
L279162	u1317	m88	DICK	Can I help you?
L279161	u1323	m88	ROB	Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
L279127	u1317	m88	DICK	The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
L279126	u1323	m88	ROB	What's this?
L279125	u1323	m88	ROB	Okay.
L279124	u1317	m88	DICK	Well, I'll just make it for you.
L279123	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
L279122	u1317	m88	DICK	'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
L279121	u1323	m88	ROB	No, that's okay.  Really.
L279120	u1317	m88	DICK	I'll tape it for you.
L279119	u1323	m88	ROB	Great.
L279118	u1317	m88	DICK	Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
L279117	u1323	m88	ROB	Good weekend?
L279116	u1317	m88	DICK	Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
L279115	u1323	m88	ROB	'Morning, Dick.
L279669	u1319	m88	LAURA	Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
L279668	u1318	m88	IAN	Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
L279667	u1319	m88	LAURA	Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
L279666	u1318	m88	IAN	Maybe I should talk to him.
L279665	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm upset, but I'm fine.
L279664	u1318	m88	IAN	You look upset.
L279663	u1319	m88	LAURA	Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
L279661	u1319	m88	LAURA	I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
L279660	u1318	m88	IAN	Laura?  Are you okay?
L279726	u1318	m88	IAN	Think about it, Rob.
L279725	u1323	m88	ROB	I dunno.
L279724	u1318	m88	IAN	So shall we leave it at that then?
L279720	u1323	m88	ROB	We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
L279719	u1318	m88	IAN	Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
L279718	u1323	m88	ROB	I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
L279717	u1318	m88	IAN	Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
L279716	u1318	m88	IAN	Think about it, Rob.
L279715	u1323	m88	ROB	I dunno.
L279714	u1318	m88	IAN	Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
L279713	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.
L279712	u1318	m88	IAN	We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
L279711	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
L279710	u1318	m88	IAN	We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
L279709	u1323	m88	ROB	Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
L279708	u1318	m88	IAN	Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
L279707	u1323	m88	ROB	What needs sorting out?
L279705	u1318	m88	IAN	Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
L279704	u1323	m88	ROB	Can I help you?
L280133	u1319	m88	LAURA	It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
L280132	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
L280129	u1319	m88	LAURA	Well, you've asked.
L280128	u1323	m88	ROB	I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
L280127	u1319	m88	LAURA	I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
L280126	u1323	m88	ROB	Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
L280125	u1319	m88	LAURA	I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
L280124	u1323	m88	ROB	This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
L280123	u1319	m88	LAURA	About what?
L280122	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
L280121	u1319	m88	LAURA	So?
L280120	u1323	m88	ROB	Fair enough.
L280119	u1319	m88	LAURA	No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
L280118	u1323	m88	ROB	Are you persuadable?
L280117	u1319	m88	LAURA	Very persuasive.
L280116	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't know.
L280115	u1319	m88	LAURA	Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
L280114	u1323	m88	ROB	Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
L280113	u1319	m88	LAURA	No.  Probably not.
L280112	u1323	m88	ROB	Would you marry me if I was?
L280111	u1319	m88	LAURA	Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
L280110	u1323	m88	ROB	Not in love, exactly, but...
L280109	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
L280108	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
L280107	u1319	m88	LAURA	I know.
L280106	u1323	m88	ROB	I mean it.
L280105	u1319	m88	LAURA	Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
L280104	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
L280103	u1319	m88	LAURA	What are you going to talk to me about?
L280102	u1319	m88	LAURA	Right.
L280101	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm going to talk to you.
L280100	u1319	m88	LAURA	Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
L280099	u1323	m88	ROB	Not really.
L280098	u1319	m88	LAURA	Are you worried about tomorrow night?
L280046	u1323	m88	ROB	I know.  I don't get it.
L280045	u1319	m88	LAURA	That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
L280044	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
L280041	u1319	m88	LAURA	We took care of that.
L280040	u1323	m88	ROB	It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
L280039	u1319	m88	LAURA	They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
L280022	u1319	m88	LAURA	Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
L280021	u1323	m88	ROB	Barry?  Barry knows about this?
L280020	u1319	m88	LAURA	Barry said its done.
L280019	u1323	m88	ROB	That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
L280018	u1319	m88	LAURA	What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
L280017	u1323	m88	ROB	You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
L280016	u1319	m88	LAURA	I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
L280015	u1323	m88	ROB	"And the ""triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?"" ""Triumphant?"" ""Return?"""
L280014	u1319	m88	LAURA	Just local, of course.
L280013	u1323	m88	ROB	WHAT?
L280012	u1319	m88	LAURA	"Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, ""would be a highly anticipated event, locally."" He helped me put out a press release."
L280011	u1323	m88	ROB	Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
L280010	u1319	m88	LAURA	I called Dan Koretzky because he --
L280009	u1319	m88	LAURA	I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
L280008	u1323	m88	ROB	You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
L279998	u1323	m88	ROB	Ha.
L279997	u1319	m88	LAURA	I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
L279996	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
L279995	u1319	m88	LAURA	At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
L279994	u1323	m88	ROB	Where?
L279993	u1319	m88	LAURA	Wanna go to dinner?
L279992	u1323	m88	ROB	Nothing.
L279991	u1319	m88	LAURA	Hi.  What are you doing?
L279990	u1323	m88	ROB	Hi.
L279958	u1323	m88	ROB	No use.
L279957	u1319	m88	LAURA	All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
L279956	u1319	m88	LAURA	How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
L279955	u1323	m88	ROB	You're being stupid.
L279954	u1319	m88	LAURA	Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
L279953	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm alright.
L279952	u1319	m88	LAURA	Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
L279951	u1323	m88	ROB	Harder.
L279950	u1319	m88	LAURA	More confident, maybe.
L279949	u1323	m88	ROB	You're tougher.
L279948	u1319	m88	LAURA	I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
L279947	u1323	m88	ROB	And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
L279946	u1319	m88	LAURA	You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
L279945	u1323	m88	ROB	But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
L279944	u1319	m88	LAURA	But what?
L279943	u1323	m88	ROB	No, but...
L279942	u1319	m88	LAURA	Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
L279941	u1323	m88	ROB	Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
L279940	u1319	m88	LAURA	How?  How were we the same people?
L279939	u1323	m88	ROB	But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
L279938	u1319	m88	LAURA	Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
L279937	u1323	m88	ROB	Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
L279936	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
L279935	u1323	m88	ROB	Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
L279934	u1319	m88	LAURA	... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
L279932	u1323	m88	ROB	Okay.
L279931	u1319	m88	LAURA	Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
L279930	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh, great...
L279929	u1319	m88	LAURA	To make you feel better.
L279928	u1323	m88	ROB	Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
L279927	u1319	m88	LAURA	Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
L279926	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
L279925	u1323	m88	ROB	Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
L279924	u1319	m88	LAURA	Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
L279923	u1323	m88	ROB	You know the difference.
L279922	u1319	m88	LAURA	What's the difference?
L279921	u1323	m88	ROB	Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
L279920	u1319	m88	LAURA	It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
L279919	u1323	m88	ROB	What it was like.
L279918	u1319	m88	LAURA	Want to know what, exactly?
L279917	u1323	m88	ROB	C'mon.  I want to know.
L279915	u1323	m88	ROB	Okay.
L279914	u1319	m88	LAURA	Let's go home.  Okay?
L279913	u1319	m88	LAURA	I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
L279912	u1323	m88	ROB	Mission accomplished.
L279911	u1319	m88	LAURA	Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
L279910	u1323	m88	ROB	What about Ian?
L279909	u1319	m88	LAURA	Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
L279908	u1323	m88	ROB	So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
L279907	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm too tired not to go out with you.
L279906	u1323	m88	ROB	Laura...
L279904	u1319	m88	LAURA	I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
L279903	u1323	m88	ROB	Look, we can do other things.
L279902	u1323	m88	ROB	I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
L279901	u1319	m88	LAURA	Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
L279900	u1323	m88	ROB	No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
L279899	u1319	m88	LAURA	Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
L279898	u1323	m88	ROB	You know, with Ray...
L279897	u1319	m88	LAURA	I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
L279896	u1323	m88	ROB	Hi.
L279895	u1319	m88	LAURA	Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
L279894	u1319	m88	LAURA	It'll have to be sex, then.
L279893	u1323	m88	ROB	I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
L279892	u1319	m88	LAURA	I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
L279891	u1323	m88	ROB	What?
L279890	u1319	m88	LAURA	I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
L279889	u1323	m88	ROB	When are you going back?
L279888	u1319	m88	LAURA	C'mon.
L279887	u1323	m88	ROB	What do you want to do?
L279886	u1319	m88	LAURA	I don't want to go back.
L279885	u1323	m88	ROB	Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
L279884	u1319	m88	LAURA	I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
L279883	u1323	m88	ROB	What do you mean?
L279882	u1319	m88	LAURA	Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
L279881	u1323	m88	ROB	I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
L279880	u1319	m88	LAURA	You're also an idiot.
L279879	u1323	m88	ROB	Mmnn.
L279878	u1319	m88	LAURA	You're soaking.
L279877	u1323	m88	ROB	Uh... No.
L279876	u1319	m88	LAURA	Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
L279852	u1323	m88	ROB	Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
L279851	u1319	m88	LAURA	Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
L279850	u1323	m88	ROB	Yes, of course.
L279849	u1319	m88	LAURA	Look, are you coming or not?
L279848	u1319	m88	LAURA	I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
L279847	u1323	m88	ROB	Do you want me to be there?
L279846	u1319	m88	LAURA	My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
L279845	u1323	m88	ROB	Me?
L279839	u1319	m88	LAURA	In a minute.  When I get it together.
L279838	u1323	m88	ROB	No, no.  When are you going home?
L279837	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm sorry.
L279817	u1319	m88	LAURA	My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
L279816	u1323	m88	ROB	Who the fuck's Pig?
L279815	u1319	m88	LAURA	Pig died.
L279814	u1323	m88	ROB	Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
L279813	u1319	m88	LAURA	Pigsty.
L279812	u1323	m88	ROB	Are you alright?
L279811	u1323	m88	ROB	God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
L279810	u1319	m88	LAURA	I can't talk right now.
L279809	u1323	m88	ROB	Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
L279808	u1323	m88	ROB	Hey, how ya doin'?
L279807	u1319	m88	LAURA	Hello.
L279804	u1319	m88	LAURA	Well, think about it.
L279803	u1323	m88	ROB	I guess I am.
L279802	u1319	m88	LAURA	You're being deliberately obtuse.
L279801	u1323	m88	ROB	I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
L279800	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
L279799	u1323	m88	ROB	Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
L279798	u1319	m88	LAURA	They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
L279797	u1323	m88	ROB	Sure they are.
L279796	u1319	m88	LAURA	Those aren't mine.
L279795	u1323	m88	ROB	Don't forget your CDs.
L279792	u1319	m88	LAURA	Oh ho, so very infrequently.
L279791	u1323	m88	ROB	You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
L279790	u1319	m88	LAURA	Mmm hmm.
L279789	u1323	m88	ROB	You know I'm a good person.
L279788	u1319	m88	LAURA	You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
L279787	u1323	m88	ROB	This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
L279786	u1323	m88	ROB	"I hate him too.  So I just call him ""Mavis."" Or ""Sissyboy."" Or ""Mavis the Sissyboy."""
L279785	u1319	m88	LAURA	Ray.  I hate Ian.
L279784	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
L279783	u1319	m88	LAURA	You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
L279782	u1323	m88	ROB	I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
L279781	u1319	m88	LAURA	Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
L279779	u1319	m88	LAURA	You know what I mean.
L279778	u1323	m88	ROB	That bad, eh?
L279777	u1319	m88	LAURA	I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
L279776	u1323	m88	ROB	You still together?  Going all right?
L279775	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm sure.
L279774	u1323	m88	ROB	It was kind of funny.
L279773	u1319	m88	LAURA	He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
L279772	u1323	m88	ROB	Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
L279771	u1319	m88	LAURA	Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
L279770	u1323	m88	ROB	Is that the last of it?
L279769	u1319	m88	LAURA	I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
L279659	u1323	m88	ROB	No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
L279658	u1319	m88	LAURA	You don't ever think about other people?
L279657	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
L279656	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
L279655	u1323	m88	ROB	Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
L279654	u1319	m88	LAURA	Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
L279653	u1323	m88	ROB	Are you still in love with me?
L279651	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm not -- hold on...
L279650	u1323	m88	ROB	"I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing ""Doctor Who""-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him."
L279649	u1319	m88	LAURA	I figured it was.  Where are you?
L279648	u1323	m88	ROB	It's me.
L279647	u1319	m88	LAURA	Hello.
L279642	u1323	m88	ROB	You do, huh.
L279641	u1319	m88	LAURA	Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
L279640	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't have your number.
L279639	u1319	m88	LAURA	Will you call me?
L279638	u1323	m88	ROB	Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
L279637	u1319	m88	LAURA	We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
L279636	u1323	m88	ROB	Nothing.
L279635	u1319	m88	LAURA	And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
L279634	u1319	m88	LAURA	You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
L279633	u1323	m88	ROB	"You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? ""Motel Matches?"" ""I Want You?"" ""I Hope You're Happy Now?"" ""Green Shirt?"" His records should be sealed in cases that say ""in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass."" ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night,"" sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing."
L279630	u1323	m88	ROB	I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
L279629	u1319	m88	LAURA	Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
L279628	u1323	m88	ROB	I guess.
L279627	u1319	m88	LAURA	Is that why you wanted to see me?
L279626	u1323	m88	ROB	No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
L279625	u1319	m88	LAURA	I told you I slept with him.
L279624	u1323	m88	ROB	Have you slept with him yet?
L279623	u1319	m88	LAURA	So, how are you?
L279577	u1323	m88	ROB	Great... That's great.
L279576	u1319	m88	LAURA	We'll talk some other time.
L279575	u1323	m88	ROB	Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
L279574	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
L279573	u1323	m88	ROB	I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
L279572	u1319	m88	LAURA	Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
L279571	u1323	m88	ROB	Hi.
L279513	u1319	m88	LAURA	Will you please just go?
L279512	u1323	m88	ROB	The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
L279511	u1319	m88	LAURA	No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
L279510	u1323	m88	ROB	But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
L279509	u1319	m88	LAURA	I haven't felt like it.
L279508	u1323	m88	ROB	Never?
L279507	u1319	m88	LAURA	Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
L279506	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't know.
L279505	u1319	m88	LAURA	You really think it would make a difference either way?
L279504	u1323	m88	ROB	Of course it is.
L279503	u1319	m88	LAURA	Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
L279502	u1323	m88	ROB	Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
L279501	u1319	m88	LAURA	Is what better?  Better than what?
L279500	u1323	m88	ROB	Is it better?
L279499	u1319	m88	LAURA	Just ask it!
L279498	u1323	m88	ROB	You won't like it.
L279497	u1319	m88	LAURA	Nevermind.
L279496	u1323	m88	ROB	It sounds stupid.
L279495	u1319	m88	LAURA	Fine.  One.
L279494	u1323	m88	ROB	No problem.  If I can ask one question.
L279493	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
L279492	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.  Great.
L279491	u1319	m88	LAURA	Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
L279490	u1323	m88	ROB	Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
L279489	u1319	m88	LAURA	-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
L279488	u1323	m88	ROB	Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
L279487	u1319	m88	LAURA	Oh, Rob, shut up.
L279486	u1323	m88	ROB	So we have a chance of getting back together again.
L279485	u1319	m88	LAURA	I suppose so.
L279484	u1323	m88	ROB	Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
L279483	u1319	m88	LAURA	I don't know.
L279482	u1323	m88	ROB	So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
L279481	u1319	m88	LAURA	Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
L279479	u1323	m88	ROB	Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
L279478	u1319	m88	LAURA	I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
L279477	u1323	m88	ROB	Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
L279476	u1319	m88	LAURA	Rob.  Don't be childish.
L279475	u1323	m88	ROB	No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
L279474	u1319	m88	LAURA	Did you say something?
L279473	u1323	m88	ROB	What, what?
L279472	u1319	m88	LAURA	What?
L279470	u1323	m88	ROB	No.
L279469	u1319	m88	LAURA	I guess it's not that obvious, then.
L279468	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't know.
L279467	u1319	m88	LAURA	What's the obvious stuff?
L279466	u1323	m88	ROB	Just the obvious stuff.
L279465	u1319	m88	LAURA	What were the others?
L279464	u1323	m88	ROB	I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
L279463	u1319	m88	LAURA	What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
L279462	u1323	m88	ROB	Good.  So.  Is it my job?
L279461	u1319	m88	LAURA	I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
L279460	u1323	m88	ROB	Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
L279459	u1319	m88	LAURA	I think you know that.
L279458	u1323	m88	ROB	So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
L279456	u1323	m88	ROB	Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
L279455	u1319	m88	LAURA	Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
L279451	u1323	m88	ROB	Not really.
L279450	u1319	m88	LAURA	And do you like it that way?
L279449	u1323	m88	ROB	Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
L279448	u1319	m88	LAURA	You really believe that?
L279447	u1323	m88	ROB	But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
L279446	u1319	m88	LAURA	Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
L279445	u1323	m88	ROB	So you weren't interested in music at all?
L279444	u1319	m88	LAURA	Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
L279443	u1323	m88	ROB	"You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- ""It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."""
L279441	u1319	m88	LAURA	I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
L279440	u1323	m88	ROB	But don't you remember?
L279439	u1319	m88	LAURA	Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
L279438	u1323	m88	ROB	"Hey!  Marvin Gaye! ""Got to Give It Up!"" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!"
L279437	u1319	m88	LAURA	-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
L279436	u1323	m88	ROB	-- Alright, alright but --
L279435	u1319	m88	LAURA	-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
L279434	u1323	m88	ROB	-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
L279433	u1319	m88	LAURA	It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
L279432	u1323	m88	ROB	How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
L279429	u1323	m88	ROB	My house?
L279428	u1319	m88	LAURA	Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
L279427	u1323	m88	ROB	Are you coming home?
L279426	u1319	m88	LAURA	I thought I could give you a lift back.
L279425	u1323	m88	ROB	Hi.
L279424	u1319	m88	LAURA	Hi.
L279423	u1323	m88	ROB	Shit!
L279324	u1319	m88	LAURA	I should be so lucky.
L279323	u1323	m88	ROB	Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
L279096	u1323	m88	ROB	Well stay for tonight, then.
L279095	u1319	m88	LAURA	We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
L279094	u1323	m88	ROB	You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
L279874	u1320	m88	LIZ	"If by ""we"" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do."
L279873	u1323	m88	ROB	Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
L279872	u1320	m88	LIZ	Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
L279871	u1323	m88	ROB	I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
L279870	u1320	m88	LIZ	Enough of what?
L279869	u1323	m88	ROB	Enough, Liz.
L279860	u1323	m88	ROB	Isn't that how it is for everybody?
L279859	u1320	m88	LIZ	No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
L279858	u1323	m88	ROB	Is Ray going?
L279857	u1320	m88	LIZ	What difference does it make?
L279856	u1323	m88	ROB	You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
L279855	u1320	m88	LIZ	It's a crematorium.
L279854	u1323	m88	ROB	So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
L279369	u1323	m88	ROB	Well she --
L279368	u1320	m88	LIZ	"Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were ""kind of looking around for somebody else!"""
L279367	u1323	m88	ROB	It's true!
L279366	u1320	m88	LIZ	To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
L279365	u1320	m88	LIZ	-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
L279364	u1323	m88	ROB	What's the -- hey, Liz --
L279302	u1320	m88	LIZ	Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
L279301	u1323	m88	ROB	"Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, ""you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be."" You know?"
L279300	u1320	m88	LIZ	How're you holding up?
L279299	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
L279298	u1320	m88	LIZ	You called this morning?
L279297	u1323	m88	ROB	What's happenin'.
L279296	u1320	m88	LIZ	Hey.  It's Liz.
L279295	u1323	m88	ROB	Rob here.
L279563	u1321	m88	MARIE	Right.
L279562	u1323	m88	ROB	I'll call you.
L279561	u1321	m88	MARIE	And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
L279560	u1323	m88	ROB	That way.
L279559	u1321	m88	MARIE	That way.  You?
L279558	u1323	m88	ROB	Which way are you going?
L279555	u1321	m88	MARIE	God, you ask a lot of questions.
L279554	u1323	m88	ROB	Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
L279552	u1321	m88	MARIE	Good.
L279551	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah.
L279550	u1321	m88	MARIE	So you'll stay?
L279549	u1323	m88	ROB	I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
L279548	u1321	m88	MARIE	Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
L279547	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh, right.  Alright.
L279546	u1321	m88	MARIE	I'd like it if you could stay the night.
L279545	u1321	m88	MARIE	When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
L279544	u1323	m88	ROB	I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
L279543	u1321	m88	MARIE	Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
L279542	u1323	m88	ROB	Whiskey.
L279541	u1321	m88	MARIE	Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
L279540	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm sure it isn't.
L279539	u1321	m88	MARIE	For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
L279538	u1323	m88	ROB	Yes.  You?
L279537	u1321	m88	MARIE	Are you okay?
L279535	u1323	m88	ROB	Nor have you!
L279534	u1321	m88	MARIE	You haven't even seen it!
L279533	u1323	m88	ROB	Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
L279532	u1321	m88	MARIE	The Conformist.
L279531	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
L279530	u1323	m88	ROB	Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
L279529	u1321	m88	MARIE	Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
L279528	u1323	m88	ROB	What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
L279527	u1321	m88	MARIE	Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
L279526	u1323	m88	ROB	Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
L279525	u1323	m88	ROB	I understand completely.
L279524	u1321	m88	MARIE	No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
L279523	u1323	m88	ROB	You share a place with T-Bone?
L279522	u1321	m88	MARIE	Yup.
L279521	u1323	m88	ROB	Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
L279520	u1321	m88	MARIE	Thank you.
L279519	u1323	m88	ROB	It's a great song.
L279518	u1321	m88	MARIE	"God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song ""Patsy Cline Times Two"" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections."
L279517	u1323	m88	ROB	She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
L279516	u1321	m88	MARIE	Everything go alright?
L279515	u1323	m88	ROB	Hi, Marie.
L279310	u1323	m88	ROB	No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
L279309	u1321	m88	MARIE	Don't you like that?
L279281	u1321	m88	MARIE	Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
L279280	u1323	m88	ROB	So you live in Chicago now?
L279279	u1323	m88	ROB	Good.
L279278	u1321	m88	MARIE	Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
L279253	u1322	m88	MOM	Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
L279252	u1323	m88	ROB	Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
L279251	u1322	m88	MOM	So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
L279250	u1323	m88	ROB	It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
L279249	u1322	m88	MOM	What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
L279248	u1323	m88	ROB	Then what are you getting so upset about?
L279247	u1322	m88	MOM	I knew this was going to happen.
L279246	u1323	m88	ROB	Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
L279245	u1322	m88	MOM	And after that?
L279244	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
L279243	u1322	m88	MOM	I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
L279242	u1323	m88	ROB	Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
L279241	u1322	m88	MOM	You know that's not what's upsetting me.
L279240	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
L279239	u1323	m88	ROB	Hello?  Anybody there?
L279237	u1323	m88	ROB	She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
L279236	u1322	m88	MOM	Well call her mother.
L279235	u1323	m88	ROB	How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
L279234	u1322	m88	MOM	What do you mean?  Where did she go?
L279233	u1323	m88	ROB	She left.  She's gone.
L279232	u1322	m88	MOM	Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
L279231	u1323	m88	ROB	So so.  Up and down.
L279230	u1322	m88	MOM	How's the store?
L279229	u1323	m88	ROB	Great.  Super-fantastic.
L279228	u1322	m88	MOM	Everything all right?
L279227	u1323	m88	ROB	Hi, Mom.
L279226	u1322	m88	MOM	Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
L279225	u1323	m88	ROB	Yeah?
L279361	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
L279360	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
L279359	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Sure.  Ten cents.
L279358	u1323	m88	ROB	Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
L279357	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Fine.
L279356	u1323	m88	ROB	I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
L279355	u1325	m88	WOMAN	With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
L279354	u1325	m88	WOMAN	And I won't take a penny over ninety.
L279353	u1323	m88	ROB	Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
L279352	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Seventy-five.
L279351	u1323	m88	ROB	Thirteen hundred.
L279350	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Sixty.
L279349	u1323	m88	ROB	That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
L279348	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
L279347	u1323	m88	ROB	Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
L279346	u1325	m88	WOMAN	That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
L279345	u1323	m88	ROB	Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
L279344	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
L279343	u1323	m88	ROB	It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
L279342	u1325	m88	WOMAN	He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
L279341	u1323	m88	ROB	And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
L279340	u1325	m88	WOMAN	I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
L279339	u1323	m88	ROB	But you must have --
L279338	u1325	m88	WOMAN	I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
L279337	u1323	m88	ROB	These are worth at least, I don't know --
L279336	u1325	m88	WOMAN	Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
L279335	u1323	m88	ROB	It's the best collection I've ever seen.
L279334	u1325	m88	WOMAN	What do you think?
L279977	u1324	m88	VINCE	What's the name of your label?
L279976	u1323	m88	ROB	Nice.
L279975	u1324	m88	VINCE	We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
L279971	u1323	m88	ROB	Whatever.
L279970	u1324	m88	VINCE	I'm Vince.
L279969	u1323	m88	ROB	We're not there yet, Justin.
L279968	u1324	m88	VINCE	Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
L279967	u1323	m88	ROB	It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
L279414	u1323	m88	ROB	Fuck off.
L279413	u1324	m88	VINCE	Records are those big round black things, right?
L279412	u1323	m88	ROB	"Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the ""mothers,"" as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it."
L279409	u1324	m88	VINCE	No, we...
L279408	u1323	m88	ROB	Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
L279407	u1323	m88	ROB	I can't frisk you but the cops can.
L279406	u1324	m88	VINCE	Well we don't.
L279405	u1323	m88	ROB	I think you have more.
L279402	u1323	m88	ROB	Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
L279401	u1324	m88	VINCE	Naw.  Those are for us.
L279400	u1323	m88	ROB	Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
L426158	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
L426157	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
L426151	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
L426150	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Our pleasure, Big Dan.
L426149	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
L426133	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
L426132	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
L426131	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
L426489	u2391	m153	COOLEY	The law. Well the law is a human institution.
L426488	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It ain't the law!
L426482	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
L426481	u2391	m153	COOLEY	- and share one of your graves.
L426480	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hang on there -
L426479	u2391	m153	COOLEY	Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
L426478	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You can't do this -
L426477	u2391	m153	COOLEY	You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
L426476	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Waitaminute -
L426475	u2391	m153	COOLEY	- but now it deposits you here.
L426474	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Waitaminute -
L426473	u2391	m153	COOLEY	End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
L426493	u2401	m153	PETE	Good Lord, what do we do?
L426492	u2392	m153	DELMAR	I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
L426326	u2401	m153	PETE	Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
L426325	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Huh?!
L426324	u2401	m153	PETE	Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
L426323	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
L426322	u2401	m153	PETE	No, they never did turn me into a toad.
L426321	u2392	m153	DELMAR	We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
L426280	u2401	m153	PETE	Do not seek the treasure!
L426279	u2392	m153	DELMAR	...Pete?
L426005	u2401	m153	PETE	What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
L426004	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
L425992	u2401	m153	PETE	Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
L425991	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
L425975	u2401	m153	PETE	All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
L425974	u2392	m153	DELMAR	That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
L425973	u2401	m153	PETE	That's right!
L425911	u2401	m153	PETE	You mis'able little sneak thief...
L425910	u2392	m153	DELMAR	You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
L425903	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Gopher, Everett?
L425902	u2401	m153	PETE	We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
L425840	u2401	m153	PETE	How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
L425839	u2392	m153	DELMAR	'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
L426500	u2392	m153	DELMAR	That ain't it!
L426499	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
L426498	u2392	m153	DELMAR	A miracle! It was a miracle!
L426464	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
L426463	u2392	m153	DELMAR	We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
L426452	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
L426451	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
L426447	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Oh, okay.
L426446	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
L426445	u2392	m153	DELMAR	What sat mean exactly, Everett?
L426403	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Everett, my beard itches.
L426402	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
L426396	u2394	m153	EVERETT	He was never turned into a frog!
L426395	u2392	m153	DELMAR	'N turned into a frog -
L426354	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Oh my God!
L426353	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
L426346	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
L426345	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
L426339	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
L426338	u2392	m153	DELMAR	So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
L426274	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
L426273	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
L426272	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
L426271	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
L426270	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
L426269	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Okay, Everett.
L426268	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
L426192	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Not that I'm aware.
L426191	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete have a brother?
L426135	u2394	m153	EVERETT	We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
L426134	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Uh, we uh-
L426122	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
L426121	u2392	m153	DELMAR	I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
L426120	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
L426117	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
L426116	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...I'm not sure that's Pete.
L426113	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
L426112	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
L426109	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
L426108	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Whuhh...
L426073	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
L426072	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
L426021	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
L426020	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Yeah, look at me.
L426016	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Where's Tommy?
L426015	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
L426014	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
L426013	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
L426000	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
L425999	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Izzat right?
L425998	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Four hundred, Delmar.
L425997	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
L425954	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
L425953	u2392	m153	DELMAR	This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
L425945	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
L425944	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
L425941	u2392	m153	DELMAR	You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
L425940	u2394	m153	EVERETT	That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
L425939	u2392	m153	DELMAR	But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
L425935	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
L425934	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
L425933	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
L425932	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
L425931	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
L425898	u2394	m153	EVERETT	And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
L425897	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Gopher, Everett?
L425896	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
L425874	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
L425873	u2394	m153	EVERETT	NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
L425871	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Fire! I hate fire!
L425870	u2392	m153	DELMAR	What do we do now, Everett?
L425825	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
L425824	u2392	m153	DELMAR	How'd he know about the treasure?
L426391	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
L426390	u2399	m153	PAPPY	You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
L426384	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Campaign manager? Waldrip.
L426383	u2399	m153	PAPPY	What's his name again?
L426375	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Assa good idea, Pappy.
L426374	u2399	m153	PAPPY	I'm sayin' we har this man away.
L426302	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Problem a p'seption.
L426301	u2399	m153	PAPPY	Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
L426147	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Okay, Pappy.
L426146	u2399	m153	PAPPY	I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
L425988	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
L425987	u2399	m153	PAPPY	We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
L426418	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
L426417	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Not out the other side his face, though.
L426416	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
L426386	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Vernon T. Waldrip.
L426385	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Vernon Waldrip.
L426382	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Powas p'suasion.
L426381	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
L426380	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
L426379	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
L426378	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
L426377	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
L426376	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Helluva idea.
L426312	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Wipin' little circles with his bread...
L426311	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Pullin' ah pants down...
L426310	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
L426309	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Well, that's how I characterize it.
L426308	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
L426307	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
L426306	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
L426305	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
L426304	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
L426303	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Ass right.
L426297	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Helluva awgazation.
L426296	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Devil his due.
L426295	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
L426294	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Suckin' away.
L426293	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Wipin' little circles with his bread.
L426292	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Latch right on to that tit.
L426291	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
L426290	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Gonna pluck us off the tit.
L426289	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
L426288	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Them straw polls is ugly.
L425984	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
L425983	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	In any state.
L425982	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
L426536	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well sure, honey, but...
L426535	u2400	m153	PENNY	I counted to three, honey.
L426533	u2400	m153	PENNY	That wasn't my doing...
L426532	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Yes, but honey -
L426531	u2400	m153	PENNY	I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
L426530	u2394	m153	EVERETT	A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
L426529	u2400	m153	PENNY	Uh-huh.
L426528	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
L426527	u2400	m153	PENNY	Well, we need that ring.
L426526	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, I'm sorry honey -
L426525	u2400	m153	PENNY	Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
L426524	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You -
L426523	u2400	m153	PENNY	Or, it might a been under the mattress.
L426522	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You said -
L426521	u2400	m153	PENNY	I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
L426520	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You said it was in the rolltop desk!
L426519	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
L426518	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Not your...
L426517	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's not my ring.
L426516	u2394	m153	EVERETT	- in the gods - Huh?
L426515	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's not my ring.
L426514	u2394	m153	EVERETT	And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
L426513	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's good, honey.
L426512	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
L426511	u2394	m153	EVERETT	But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
L426510	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's right, honey.
L426509	u2394	m153	EVERETT	All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
L426462	u2400	m153	PENNY	No weddin'.
L426461	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It's just a symbol, honey -
L426460	u2400	m153	PENNY	Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
L426459	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
L426458	u2400	m153	PENNY	We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
L426457	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
L426456	u2400	m153	PENNY	I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
L426455	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Where's your ring, honey?
L426454	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
L426453	u2400	m153	PENNY	McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
L426262	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
L426261	u2400	m153	PENNY	I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
L426260	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
L426259	u2400	m153	PENNY	No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
L426258	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Now Penny, stop that!
L426257	u2400	m153	PENNY	That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
L426504	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
L426503	u2401	m153	PETE	That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
L426502	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
L426501	u2401	m153	PETE	We prayed to God and he pitied us!
L426405	u2394	m153	EVERETT	No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
L426404	u2401	m153	PETE	This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
L426394	u2401	m153	PETE	Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
L426393	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
L426351	u2401	m153	PETE	Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
L426350	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete... I do apologize.
L426344	u2401	m153	PETE	...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
L426343	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
L426342	u2401	m153	PETE	...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
L426341	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
L426340	u2401	m153	PETE	But...
L426337	u2401	m153	PETE	But... but...
L426336	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Fact of the matter - there never was!
L426334	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, but Pete...
L426333	u2401	m153	PETE	I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
L426332	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
L426329	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Aw, that's all right.
L426328	u2401	m153	PETE	It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
L426320	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
L426319	u2401	m153	PETE	They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
L426318	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
L426317	u2401	m153	PETE	It was a moment a weakness!
L426029	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
L426028	u2401	m153	PETE	...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
L426026	u2401	m153	PETE	Isn't it, uh...
L426025	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
L426019	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
L426018	u2401	m153	PETE	The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
L426007	u2401	m153	PETE	Well that hardly sounds like you...
L426006	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
L426003	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
L426002	u2401	m153	PETE	An' all my meals for free...
L425996	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Million point two.
L425995	u2401	m153	PETE	A million dollars.
L425943	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
L425942	u2401	m153	PETE	Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
L425938	u2394	m153	EVERETT	For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
L425937	u2401	m153	PETE	The preacher said it absolved us.
L425930	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, don't be ignorant-
L425929	u2401	m153	PETE	Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
L425917	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
L425916	u2401	m153	PETE	That don't make no sense!
L425915	u2394	m153	EVERETT	So I borrowed it till I did know!
L425914	u2401	m153	PETE	You didn't know that at the time!
L425913	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Who was fixing to betray us!
L425909	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It was in his bureau.
L425908	u2401	m153	PETE	To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
L425907	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
L425906	u2401	m153	PETE	How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
L425901	u2401	m153	PETE	We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
L425900	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Don't I know it.
L425899	u2401	m153	PETE	Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
L425876	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
L425875	u2401	m153	PETE	YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
L425863	u2401	m153	PETE	The hell you say! Wash is kin!
L425862	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
L425810	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
L425809	u2401	m153	PETE	Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
L425808	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
L425807	u2401	m153	PETE	Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
L425894	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
L425893	u2402	m153	PROPRIETOR	Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
L425892	u2394	m153	EVERETT	No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
L425891	u2402	m153	PROPRIETOR	I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
L425890	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
L425889	u2402	m153	PROPRIETOR	Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
L425888	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
L425978	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.

L426205	u2404	m153	YOUNGEST	Daddy!
L550988	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just not the eyes.
L550987	u3053	m200	BEEMER	I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
L550986	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
L550985	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
L550984	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
L550983	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Bullshit politics.
L550982	u3057	m200	LENNY	I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
L550981	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Yeah, that's right.
L550726	u3057	m200	LENNY	A star is born.
L550725	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	No problem.
L550724	u3057	m200	LENNY	Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
L550723	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	Yeah, right.
L550722	u3057	m200	LENNY	"Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it ""being wired,"" but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?"
L550721	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	Hey, fuck you, man.
L550720	u3057	m200	LENNY	Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
L550719	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	What's all this squid shit?
L550718	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
L551312	u3055	m200	FAITH	I live for the moment.
L551311	u3062	m200	TRAN	Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
L551310	u3055	m200	FAITH	Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
L551065	u3062	m200	TRAN	Maybe later.
L551064	u3055	m200	FAITH	Fuck you.
L551063	u3062	m200	TRAN	The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
L551062	u3062	m200	TRAN	I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
L551061	u3055	m200	FAITH	He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
L551060	u3062	m200	TRAN	"Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  ""Stand by your man"". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him."
L551059	u3055	m200	FAITH	You said you were going to get her out of this.
L551057	u3062	m200	TRAN	You're going down.
L551056	u3055	m200	FAITH	I made my choice, Lenny.
L551051	u3062	m200	TRAN	A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
L551050	u3055	m200	FAITH	Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
L550939	u3062	m200	TRAN	Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
L550938	u3055	m200	FAITH	You're too goddamned paranoid.
L550937	u3062	m200	TRAN	He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
L550936	u3055	m200	FAITH	Leave him alone, Tran.
L550935	u3062	m200	TRAN	Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
L550931	u3062	m200	TRAN	Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
L550930	u3055	m200	FAITH	We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
L551428	u3055	m200	FAITH	'We might as well make the best of it.'
L551427	u3059	m200	MAX	And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
L551426	u3055	m200	FAITH	Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
L551425	u3059	m200	MAX	I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
L551424	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
L551423	u3059	m200	MAX	You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
L551388	u3055	m200	FAITH	My God.
L551387	u3059	m200	MAX	Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
L551385	u3059	m200	MAX	Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
L551384	u3055	m200	FAITH	Jesus.
L551383	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
L551382	u3055	m200	FAITH	You can't just... kill him.
L551381	u3055	m200	FAITH	What're you going to do?
L551380	u3059	m200	MAX	Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
L551379	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
L551378	u3059	m200	MAX	This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
L551300	u3055	m200	FAITH	What a nightmare.
L551299	u3057	m200	LENNY	The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
L551298	u3055	m200	FAITH	You think Tran killed her?
L551297	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
L551296	u3055	m200	FAITH	So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
L551286	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Mace is in this.
L551285	u3055	m200	FAITH	We should talk alone.
L551284	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
L551283	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
L551282	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
L551281	u3055	m200	FAITH	What's going on?
L551048	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tell me.
L551047	u3055	m200	FAITH	You don't know what you're fucking with here.
L551046	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
L551045	u3055	m200	FAITH	Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
L551044	u3057	m200	LENNY	Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
L551043	u3055	m200	FAITH	Who did it?
L551042	u3057	m200	LENNY	Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
L551041	u3055	m200	FAITH	You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
L550969	u3055	m200	FAITH	"You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say ""The End."" You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes."
L550968	u3057	m200	LENNY	Can't do it.
L550967	u3055	m200	FAITH	Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
L550966	u3057	m200	LENNY	Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
L550965	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
L550964	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
L550963	u3055	m200	FAITH	Damn right.
L550962	u3057	m200	LENNY	Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
L550961	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
L550960	u3055	m200	FAITH	Maybe.
L550959	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?  He gonna record you on his label?
L550958	u3055	m200	FAITH	He has his uses too.
L550957	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
L550956	u3055	m200	FAITH	That's a good one, coming from you.
L550955	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
L550954	u3055	m200	FAITH	Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
L550953	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
L550952	u3055	m200	FAITH	Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
L550951	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tonight.
L550950	u3055	m200	FAITH	You talked to Iris?  When?
L550949	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
L550948	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to go.  I mean it.
L550947	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'm already hurting.
L550946	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
L550945	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
L550933	u3055	m200	FAITH	No, Lenny.
L550932	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, call me, okay?
L550926	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just got to talk to you for one second.
L550925	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
L550920	u3057	m200	LENNY	Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
L550919	u3055	m200	FAITH	Cut it out, Tran.
L550881	u3055	m200	FAITH	Make me forget it, baby.
L550880	u3057	m200	LENNY	Forget it's there.
L550879	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
L550878	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
L550877	u3055	m200	FAITH	I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
L550736	u3057	m200	LENNY	Watch and see.
L550735	u3055	m200	FAITH	Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
L550773	u3057	m200	LENNY	You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
L550772	u3056	m200	KEITH	Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
L550769	u3057	m200	LENNY	Step into my office.
L550768	u3056	m200	KEITH	What?  Right Here?
L550767	u3057	m200	LENNY	Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
L550766	u3056	m200	KEITH	Talk to me about costs, here.
L550765	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
L550764	u3056	m200	KEITH	Sounds good.
L550761	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
L550760	u3056	m200	KEITH	What kind of things exactly?
L550759	u3057	m200	LENNY	That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
L550758	u3056	m200	KEITH	Clips.
L550757	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
L550756	u3056	m200	KEITH	Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
L550755	u3057	m200	LENNY	A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
L550754	u3056	m200	KEITH	No.
L550750	u3056	m200	KEITH	That's right.
L550749	u3057	m200	LENNY	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
L550748	u3056	m200	KEITH	I understand.  No, I'm not.
L551421	u3059	m200	MAX	This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
L551420	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did you hook up with Faith?
L551419	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
L551418	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
L551417	u3059	m200	MAX	Naawww.
L551416	u3057	m200	LENNY	So there never was a death squad.
L551414	u3059	m200	MAX	You got froggy on me a couple times.
L551413	u3057	m200	LENNY	You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
L551412	u3059	m200	MAX	No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
L551411	u3057	m200	LENNY	And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
L551410	u3059	m200	MAX	Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
L551409	u3059	m200	MAX	I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
L551408	u3057	m200	LENNY	I won't say anything.
L551407	u3059	m200	MAX	Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
L551405	u3059	m200	MAX	You bet.  Did you like it?
L551404	u3057	m200	LENNY	Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
L551403	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
L551402	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
L551401	u3059	m200	MAX	That's pretty much the way it happened.
L551400	u3057	m200	LENNY	So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
L551399	u3059	m200	MAX	You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
L551398	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus!
L551397	u3059	m200	MAX	You just did.
L551396	u3057	m200	LENNY	What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
L551395	u3059	m200	MAX	I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
L551394	u3057	m200	LENNY	Where's Faith?
L551393	u3059	m200	MAX	I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
L551392	u3059	m200	MAX	Only way I could stand your ties.
L551391	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
L551321	u3059	m200	MAX	I intend to.
L551320	u3057	m200	LENNY	2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
L551319	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
L551318	u3057	m200	LENNY	This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
L551317	u3059	m200	MAX	Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
L551316	u3057	m200	LENNY	What do you mean?
L551315	u3059	m200	MAX	He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
L551269	u3059	m200	MAX	No.  Bad idea.
L551268	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay... what about Strickland?
L551267	u3059	m200	MAX	Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
L551264	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
L551263	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
L551262	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus.
L551261	u3059	m200	MAX	Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
L551260	u3057	m200	LENNY	What stuff?
L551259	u3059	m200	MAX	All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
L551258	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whattya mean?
L551252	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
L551251	u3059	m200	MAX	Is he dead?
L551250	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's been cooked-off
L551248	u3057	m200	LENNY	You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
L551247	u3059	m200	MAX	Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
L551119	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
L551118	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
L551117	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
L551116	u3057	m200	LENNY	Looks like she was holding out.
L551115	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
L551114	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith OK?
L551112	u3057	m200	LENNY	W'sup, Max?
L551111	u3059	m200	MAX	Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
L551029	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why me?
L551028	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
L551025	u3057	m200	LENNY	He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
L551024	u3059	m200	MAX	Top ten.
L551023	u3057	m200	LENNY	But this is a bad one.
L551022	u3059	m200	MAX	So've I.  Too much.
L551021	u3057	m200	LENNY	So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
L551020	u3059	m200	MAX	But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
L551019	u3057	m200	LENNY	He records himself raping and killing her--
L551018	u3059	m200	MAX	And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
L551017	u3057	m200	LENNY	He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
L551016	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
L551015	u3057	m200	LENNY	Not now... I don't want to think about it--
L551014	u3059	m200	MAX	Let's work it.
L551013	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  No, not really.
L551012	u3059	m200	MAX	You alright?  Y'okay?
L550976	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her.
L550975	u3057	m200	LENNY	Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
L550974	u3059	m200	MAX	I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
L550973	u3057	m200	LENNY	You should feel like shit.
L550972	u3059	m200	MAX	I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
L550971	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
L550826	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shutup a second!
L550825	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
L550818	u3059	m200	MAX	An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
L550817	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
L550816	u3059	m200	MAX	See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
L550798	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, Iris, you okay?
L550797	u3059	m200	MAX	I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
L550796	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
L550795	u3059	m200	MAX	Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
L550794	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  She won't call me.
L550792	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
L550791	u3057	m200	LENNY	You were lucky, Max.
L550789	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
L550788	u3059	m200	MAX	That's not sayin' much.
L550787	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
L550786	u3059	m200	MAX	D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
L550785	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.
L550784	u3059	m200	MAX	Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
L550781	u3057	m200	LENNY	Least you can do.
L550780	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
L550779	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
L550778	u3059	m200	MAX	You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
L551155	u3057	m200	LENNY	She never gave me a tape.
L551154	u3061	m200	TICK	I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
L551153	u3057	m200	LENNY	What clip?  What was it?
L551152	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
L551151	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
L551150	u3061	m200	TICK	Iris, man.  Pay attention.
L551149	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who was just here?
L551148	u3061	m200	TICK	Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
L551147	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?
L551146	u3061	m200	TICK	Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
L551143	u3061	m200	TICK	Well... the guy's fucked up.
L551142	u3057	m200	LENNY	Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
L551141	u3061	m200	TICK	Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
L550690	u3057	m200	LENNY	What else you got?
L550689	u3061	m200	TICK	Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
L550688	u3057	m200	LENNY	I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
L550687	u3061	m200	TICK	Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
L550686	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
L550685	u3061	m200	TICK	Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
L550684	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
L550683	u3061	m200	TICK	Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
L550682	u3061	m200	TICK	Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
L550681	u3057	m200	LENNY	So lay it off to somebody else.
L550680	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
L550679	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
L550678	u3061	m200	TICK	Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
L550677	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
L550676	u3061	m200	TICK	I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
L550675	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
L550674	u3061	m200	TICK	With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
L550673	u3057	m200	LENNY	How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
L550672	u3061	m200	TICK	Sorry.
L550671	u3057	m200	LENNY	Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
L550670	u3061	m200	TICK	Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
L551055	u3062	m200	TRAN	I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
L551054	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's alright.  He means it.
L551053	u3062	m200	TRAN	Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
L551052	u3057	m200	LENNY	Charm.
L550928	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
L550927	u3062	m200	TRAN	About what?
L550924	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, can I talk to you a second?
L550923	u3062	m200	TRAN	I always do.
L550922	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
L550921	u3062	m200	TRAN	Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
L550918	u3062	m200	TRAN	I already got everything I need from you.
L550917	u3057	m200	LENNY	You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
L550916	u3062	m200	TRAN	You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
L550873	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Your existence.
L550872	u3057	m200	LENNY	Your sex life?
L550871	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
L550870	u3057	m200	LENNY	I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
L550869	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
L550868	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
L550867	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Commissioner Strickland.
L550866	u3057	m200	LENNY	Strickland.
L550865	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Nero.
L551451	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  See you there.
L551450	u3057	m200	LENNY	See you downtown.
L551449	u3058	m200	MACE	Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
L551448	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  We did.
L551447	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
L551443	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
L551442	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we under arrest?
L551363	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, right.  Fucked.
L551362	u3057	m200	LENNY	Then we'll be right where we are now.
L551361	u3058	m200	MACE	Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
L551360	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Trust me.
L551359	u3058	m200	MACE	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
L551358	u3057	m200	LENNY	Take it to him.
L551354	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
L551353	u3058	m200	MACE	That's the original.  There are no copies.
L551352	u3057	m200	LENNY	I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
L551351	u3058	m200	MACE	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
L551350	u3057	m200	LENNY	Alright.  We're going up.
L551348	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.
L551347	u3057	m200	LENNY	You see Tran?
L551346	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
L551345	u3057	m200	LENNY	Got your ticket?
L551344	u3058	m200	MACE	Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
L551343	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace... you're a girl.
L551340	u3058	m200	MACE	No, it's not.
L551339	u3057	m200	LENNY	But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
L551338	u3058	m200	MACE	You never told me.
L551337	u3057	m200	LENNY	I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
L551336	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  It didn't.
L551335	u3057	m200	LENNY	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
L551334	u3058	m200	MACE	I guess.
L551333	u3057	m200	LENNY	It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
L551332	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
L551325	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
L551324	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
L551323	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm not going.
L551322	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
L551294	u3058	m200	MACE	Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
L551293	u3057	m200	LENNY	Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
L551271	u3057	m200	LENNY	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
L551270	u3058	m200	MACE	Who's Strickland?
L551266	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, right, blow it open.
L551265	u3058	m200	MACE	The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
L551254	u3058	m200	MACE	How long does it last?  Oh.
L551253	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's totally cut off from the outer world.
L551246	u3057	m200	LENNY	To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
L551245	u3058	m200	MACE	Why?
L551244	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
L551243	u3058	m200	MACE	I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
L551242	u3057	m200	LENNY	It was a tough call.
L551241	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
L551240	u3057	m200	LENNY	There's a plus side?
L551239	u3058	m200	MACE	Well, look at the plus side.
L551238	u3057	m200	LENNY	So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
L551232	u3057	m200	LENNY	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
L551231	u3058	m200	MACE	People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
L551230	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've got a good idea, yeah.
L551229	u3058	m200	MACE	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
L551228	u3057	m200	LENNY	We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
L551226	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
L551225	u3058	m200	MACE	I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
L551224	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
L551203	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
L551202	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.  I won't do it.
L551201	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
L551200	u3058	m200	MACE	Tell me.
L551192	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
L551191	u3058	m200	MACE	You sure?
L551190	u3057	m200	LENNY	Those two guys were cops.
L551186	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
L551185	u3058	m200	MACE	I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
L551180	u3058	m200	MACE	Fire's out, isn't it?
L551179	u3057	m200	LENNY	Are you out of your fucking mind?!
L551178	u3057	m200	LENNY	The gas tank's going to go any second!
L551177	u3058	m200	MACE	This is bad.
L551176	u3058	m200	MACE	It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
L551175	u3057	m200	LENNY	Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
L551174	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
L551173	u3057	m200	LENNY	Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
L551172	u3058	m200	MACE	Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
L551171	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shit!
L551166	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
L551165	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, give them the tape.
L551158	u3058	m200	MACE	Something in your car...
L551157	u3057	m200	LENNY	She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
L551156	u3058	m200	MACE	Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
L551135	u3057	m200	LENNY	"Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful."
L551134	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, have you lost it completely?
L551131	u3057	m200	LENNY	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
L551130	u3058	m200	MACE	You better keep a low profile for a while.
L551129	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
L551128	u3058	m200	MACE	Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
L551126	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie doesn't go with blue!
L551125	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L551123	u3057	m200	LENNY	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
L551122	u3058	m200	MACE	Where we going?
L551121	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace!
L551120	u3058	m200	MACE	Whatup Lenny?
L551103	u3057	m200	LENNY	S'okay.  I know you still love me.
L551102	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
L551101	u3058	m200	MACE	OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
L551100	u3057	m200	LENNY	How's Zander?
L551099	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure.
L551098	u3057	m200	LENNY	The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
L551097	u3058	m200	MACE	Now you're really getting paranoid.
L551096	u3057	m200	LENNY	And what about the guy that was following me?
L551095	u3058	m200	MACE	That's where it gets a little strange.
L551094	u3057	m200	LENNY	Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
L551093	u3058	m200	MACE	Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
L551092	u3057	m200	LENNY	If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
L551091	u3058	m200	MACE	So the guy's not a sicko.
L551090	u3057	m200	LENNY	"She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason."
L551089	u3058	m200	MACE	Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
L551088	u3057	m200	LENNY	No it doesn't.
L551087	u3058	m200	MACE	But that doesn't add, does it.
L551086	u3057	m200	LENNY	See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
L551083	u3058	m200	MACE	It's not your fault.
L551082	u3057	m200	LENNY	She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
L551081	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
L551080	u3058	m200	MACE	No more, Lenny.
L551079	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
L551078	u3058	m200	MACE	Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
L551077	u3057	m200	LENNY	It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
L551076	u3058	m200	MACE	So that gives you something.
L551075	u3057	m200	LENNY	He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
L551073	u3057	m200	LENNY	Never really thought about it.
L551072	u3058	m200	MACE	You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
L551071	u3057	m200	LENNY	Is this great fabric or what?
L551039	u3058	m200	MACE	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
L551038	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
L551035	u3058	m200	MACE	This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
L551034	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
L551031	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
L551030	u3058	m200	MACE	Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
L551027	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wants to share.
L551026	u3058	m200	MACE	And gives it to you.
L551008	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you sure it's real?
L551007	u3057	m200	LENNY	Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
L551006	u3058	m200	MACE	Blackjack?  I don't understand--
L551005	u3057	m200	LENNY	Black.  Jack.
L551004	u3058	m200	MACE	My God, Lenny.  What is it?
L551000	u3057	m200	LENNY	Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
L550999	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L550995	u3057	m200	LENNY	No idea.
L550994	u3058	m200	MACE	What's that?  Present from Faith?
L550993	u3057	m200	LENNY	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
L550992	u3058	m200	MACE	What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
L550991	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
L550990	u3058	m200	MACE	You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
L550915	u3057	m200	LENNY	You'll see.
L550914	u3058	m200	MACE	Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
L550913	u3057	m200	LENNY	She's my destiny.
L550912	u3058	m200	MACE	She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
L550911	u3057	m200	LENNY	She still loves me.
L550910	u3058	m200	MACE	Forget her.
L550909	u3057	m200	LENNY	Rams... that's football, right?
L550908	u3058	m200	MACE	Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
L550907	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
L550905	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
L550904	u3057	m200	LENNY	Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
L550903	u3058	m200	MACE	Jesus, Lenny.
L550902	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
L550901	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
L550900	u3057	m200	LENNY	You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
L550899	u3058	m200	MACE	Look, I gotta get some sleep.
L550898	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
L550897	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
L550896	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey... I've never seen you like this.
L550895	u3058	m200	MACE	No, you're just trying to get off.
L550894	u3057	m200	LENNY	So am I.  Just trying to get by.
L550893	u3058	m200	MACE	No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
L550892	u3057	m200	LENNY	I thought we were friends.
L550891	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
L550890	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
L550889	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be no.
L550887	u3058	m200	MACE	Get it.
L550886	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need my case.  It's still in the back.
L550884	u3057	m200	LENNY	In LA?  Are you crazy?
L550883	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
L550882	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
L550876	u3057	m200	LENNY	Let's talk in the car.
L550875	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we having a bad night?
L550864	u3058	m200	MACE	You will not live to see the morning.
L550863	u3057	m200	LENNY	Coming with you.
L550862	u3058	m200	MACE	What the fuck are you doing?
L550860	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
L550859	u3058	m200	MACE	Fumitsu.
L550858	u3057	m200	LENNY	What's his name?
L550856	u3058	m200	MACE	Define love.
L550855	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but that was for love.
L550854	u3058	m200	MACE	Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
L550853	u3057	m200	LENNY	Define illegal.
L550852	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this shit's illegal.
L550851	u3057	m200	LENNY	Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
L550850	u3058	m200	MACE	Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
L550849	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
L550848	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
L550847	u3057	m200	LENNY	Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
L550846	u3058	m200	MACE	Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
L550845	u3057	m200	LENNY	No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
L550844	u3058	m200	MACE	So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
L550843	u3058	m200	MACE	Driving Mr. Lenny.
L550842	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace!  You're a life-saver.
L550841	u3058	m200	MACE	Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
L550840	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
L550839	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
L550838	u3058	m200	MACE	Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
L550837	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
L550836	u3058	m200	MACE	Sleaze to peddle.
L550835	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
L550834	u3058	m200	MACE	Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
L550833	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
L550820	u3057	m200	LENNY	They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
L550819	u3058	m200	MACE	Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
L551195	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Aw, Mom!
L551194	u3058	m200	MACE	We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
L551110	u3058	m200	MACE	Well give me some then... I'm starving.
L551109	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
L551108	u3058	m200	MACE	What is that?
L551107	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you going to make me beg?
L551106	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Right.  That explains it.
L551105	u3058	m200	MACE	Just Lenny.
L551104	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
L551276	u3059	m200	MAX	You really want that on your head?
L551275	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
L551274	u3059	m200	MAX	Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
L551273	u3058	m200	MACE	So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
L551257	u3059	m200	MAX	There's more to this whole thing than you think.
L551256	u3058	m200	MACE	This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
L551255	u3059	m200	MAX	Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
L551037	u3058	m200	MACE	Take the tape to the cops.
L551036	u3059	m200	MAX	Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
L551033	u3058	m200	MACE	Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
L551032	u3059	m200	MAX	He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
L550830	u3059	m200	MAX	Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
L550829	u3058	m200	MACE	But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
L550828	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L550827	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
L550822	u3059	m200	MAX	Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
L550821	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
L14908	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
L14907	u3559	m235	AUDREY	How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
L14906	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
L14905	u3559	m235	AUDREY	The usual ten per cent?
L14904	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	"Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. ""Mister, can you spare us a copper?"" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner."
L14903	u3559	m235	AUDREY	Of course, John.
L15042	u3560	m235	BLONDE	The cards... you're bank.
L15041	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	They are?
L15040	u3560	m235	BLONDE	They're yours.
L15036	u3560	m235	BLONDE	Your cards... lay them down... face up.
L15035	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	We'd be thrown out.
L15034	u3560	m235	BLONDE	Lay them down.
L15033	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Eh?
L15032	u3560	m235	BLONDE	Lay them down.
L15402	u3561	m235	BOY	Oh.
L15401	u3574	m235	RINGO	I'm a deserter, too.
L15400	u3561	m235	BOY	Why aren't you at work?
L15399	u3561	m235	BOY	He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
L15398	u3574	m235	RINGO	How about Ding Dong?
L15397	u3561	m235	BOY	Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
L15396	u3574	m235	RINGO	What they like?
L15395	u3561	m235	BOY	Yeah.
L15394	u3574	m235	RINGO	Yeah?
L15393	u3561	m235	BOY	Oh, it's all right.
L15392	u3574	m235	RINGO	Not much cop without 'em, is it?
L15391	u3561	m235	BOY	Yeah.
L15390	u3574	m235	RINGO	Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
L15389	u3561	m235	BOY	Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
L15388	u3574	m235	RINGO	Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
L15387	u3561	m235	BOY	No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
L15386	u3574	m235	RINGO	Just you?
L15385	u3561	m235	BOY	Yeah, I've blown school out.
L15384	u3574	m235	RINGO	Are you now?
L15383	u3561	m235	BOY	I'm a deserter.
L15382	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
L15381	u3561	m235	BOY	You heard, it gets on my wick.
L15380	u3574	m235	RINGO	Y'what?
L15379	u3561	m235	BOY	Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
L15378	u3574	m235	RINGO	All right, take your hoop and bowl.
L15377	u3561	m235	BOY	Well --
L15376	u3574	m235	RINGO	Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
L15375	u3561	m235	BOY	I bet you're  -- sixteen!
L15374	u3574	m235	RINGO	Shurrup!
L15373	u3561	m235	BOY	Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
L15372	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
L15371	u3561	m235	BOY	Eight and two thirds.
L15370	u3574	m235	RINGO	Bet you're only eight and a half.
L15369	u3561	m235	BOY	Nine.
L15368	u3574	m235	RINGO	"Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>""hoop""</U> at people. How old are you anyway?"
L15367	u3561	m235	BOY	Oh don't be so stroppy!
L15366	u3574	m235	RINGO	Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
L15365	u3561	m235	BOY	Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
L15622	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	He'll be pulp by now.
L15621	u3562	m235	BOYS	The police station.
L15620	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
L15613	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Sixpence.
L15612	u3562	m235	BOYS	Yeah.
L15611	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Can you fix him for me?
L15241	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
L15240	u3562	m235	BOYS	Shurrup!
L15024	u3562	m235	BOYS	Read 'em!
L15023	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	What about all these letters?
L15636	u3571	m235	NORM	Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
L15635	u3563	m235	DIRECTOR	Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
L15535	u3563	m235	DIRECTOR	Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
L15534	u3571	m235	NORM	They'll be here.
L15533	u3563	m235	DIRECTOR	You don't think...
L15530	u3563	m235	DIRECTOR	But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
L15529	u3571	m235	NORM	I'll murder that Lennon.
L15528	u3563	m235	DIRECTOR	Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
L15250	u3563	m235	DIRECTOR	And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
L15249	u3571	m235	NORM	Sure.
L15160	u3563	m235	DIRECTOR	Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
L15159	u3571	m235	NORM	All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
L15141	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well!
L15140	u3564	m235	FLOOR MANAGER	Spoil sport!
L15139	u3574	m235	RINGO	That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
L15138	u3564	m235	FLOOR MANAGER	Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
L15137	u3574	m235	RINGO	If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
L15136	u3564	m235	FLOOR MANAGER	Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
L15135	u3574	m235	RINGO	Leave them drums alone.
L15111	u3569	m235	JOHN	Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
L15110	u3565	m235	FRANK	We're nearly there, sir.
L15105	u3569	m235	JOHN	Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
L15104	u3565	m235	FRANK	I've made the scene.
L15103	u3569	m235	JOHN	I see you go to the night court.
L15102	u3565	m235	FRANK	Ah ... a shamus, eh?
L15101	u3569	m235	JOHN	Ever seen one of these before?
L15100	u3565	m235	FRANK	Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
L15099	u3569	m235	JOHN	"Yeah, you know, ""O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"""
L15096	u3565	m235	FRANK	Sorry? 
L15095	u3569	m235	JOHN	Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
L15094	u3565	m235	FRANK	Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
L15345	u3574	m235	RINGO	No. I don't.
L15344	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
L14989	u3574	m235	RINGO	Do I snore?
L14988	u3566	m235	GEORGE	You do - repeatedly.
L14987	u3574	m235	RINGO	I don't snore.
L14971	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Bag-snatcher.
L14970	u3574	m235	RINGO	Me? Why?
L14926	u3574	m235	RINGO	No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
L14925	u3566	m235	GEORGE	You never know, you might be lucky this time.
L14924	u3574	m235	RINGO	No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
L14923	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Are you going in?
L14922	u3574	m235	RINGO	Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
L14921	u3566	m235	GEORGE	You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
L14920	u3574	m235	RINGO	He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
L15446	u3578	m235	SIMON	Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
L15445	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Have I said something amiss?
L15444	u3578	m235	SIMON	Get him out of here!!
L15443	u3566	m235	GEORGE	She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
L15442	u3578	m235	SIMON	She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
L15441	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
L15440	u3578	m235	SIMON	I beg your pardon?
L15439	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
L15438	u3578	m235	SIMON	Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
L15437	u3566	m235	GEORGE	And who's this Susan when she's at home?
L15436	u3578	m235	SIMON	And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
L15435	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I don't care.
L15434	u3578	m235	SIMON	You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
L15433	u3566	m235	GEORGE	But I won't.
L15432	u3578	m235	SIMON	Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
L15431	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Yeah, grotesque.
L15430	u3578	m235	SIMON	Grotty?
L15429	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
L15428	u3578	m235	SIMON	"Now, you'll like these. You really ""dig"" them. They're ""fab"" and all the other pimply hyperboles."
L15427	u3578	m235	SIMON	Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
L15426	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Ta.
L15425	u3578	m235	SIMON	Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
L15424	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I'll have a bash.
L15423	u3578	m235	SIMON	I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
L15422	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Of course I can.
L15421	u3578	m235	SIMON	Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
L15420	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
L15419	u3578	m235	SIMON	We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
L15417	u3578	m235	SIMON	Oh, my God, he's a natural.
L15416	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I'm afraid I don't understand.
L15415	u3578	m235	SIMON	Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
L15414	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
L15357	u3572	m235	PAUL	The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
L15356	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
L15355	u3572	m235	PAUL	He hasn't.
L15354	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
L15353	u3572	m235	PAUL	We do.
L15352	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
L15225	u3566	m235	GEORGE	You crawler.
L15224	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
L15166	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Wake up!
L15165	u3572	m235	PAUL	Ringo!
L15144	u3566	m235	GEORGE	He's sulking again.
L15143	u3572	m235	PAUL	What's up?
L15128	u3572	m235	PAUL	Ah well. Eh, look!
L15127	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Sure. .
L14935	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well, let's broaden our outlook.
L14934	u3566	m235	GEORGE	No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
L14933	u3572	m235	PAUL	Did you look in here?
L14882	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
L14881	u3572	m235	PAUL	Now what's that supposed to mean?
L14880	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
L14869	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
L14868	u3572	m235	PAUL	Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
L14798	u3572	m235	PAUL	No, straight up.
L14797	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Gerron.
L14781	u3572	m235	PAUL	Yeah, she was fickle.
L14780	u3566	m235	GEORGE	A butcher?
L14779	u3572	m235	PAUL	You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
L14770	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
L14769	u3566	m235	GEORGE	But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
L14768	u3572	m235	PAUL	It is, y'know.
L14767	u3566	m235	GEORGE	That's not your Grandfather.
L15410	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Sorry.
L15409	u3575	m235	SECRETARY	Well ... come on.
L15408	u3575	m235	SECRETARY	Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
L15407	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Is he?
L15406	u3575	m235	SECRETARY	You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
L15405	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
L15404	u3575	m235	SECRETARY	Oh, there you are!
L15624	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Come here.
L15623	u3569	m235	JOHN	What are we waiting for?
L15360	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I'll look in here again.
L15359	u3569	m235	JOHN	It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
L15254	u3566	m235	GEORGE	You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
L15253	u3569	m235	JOHN	How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
L15107	u3569	m235	JOHN	What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
L15106	u3566	m235	GEORGE	I don't think that bit's right.
L15090	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Follow your impulse.
L15089	u3569	m235	JOHN	Should I say it?
L15006	u3566	m235	GEORGE	He comes from a large family.
L15005	u3569	m235	JOHN	That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
L14946	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
L14945	u3569	m235	JOHN	Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
L14875	u3569	m235	JOHN	If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
L14874	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
L15547	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Eh, there's only three of them.
L15546	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Sorry.
L15263	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
L15262	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
L14862	u3577	m235	SHAKE	The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
L14861	u3566	m235	GEORGE	Well, what happened?
L14860	u3577	m235	SHAKE	No, I didn't you did ...
L14805	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Oh aye, but I thought ...
L14804	u3566	m235	GEORGE	It's Paul's grandfather.
L14803	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Morning!  Who's that little old man?
L15526	u3567	m235	GIRL	Of course.
L15525	u3572	m235	PAUL	See you.
L15524	u3567	m235	GIRL	Yes.
L15523	u3572	m235	PAUL	Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
L15522	u3567	m235	GIRL	Pity.
L15521	u3572	m235	PAUL	Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
L15520	u3567	m235	GIRL	And what do you do about it?
L15519	u3572	m235	PAUL	And cunning.
L15518	u3567	m235	GIRL	Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
L15517	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
L15516	u3567	m235	GIRL	And you honestly think that's what she meant?
L15515	u3572	m235	PAUL	Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
L15514	u3567	m235	GIRL	Is she?
L15513	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
L15512	u3567	m235	GIRL	Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
L15511	u3572	m235	PAUL	"No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, ""Go and give some to the other kids."" So, I said I would but I thought to meself, ""She must think I'm soft."" Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?"
L15510	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
L15509	u3567	m235	GIRL	Why selfish?
L15508	u3572	m235	PAUL	Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
L15507	u3567	m235	GIRL	I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
L15506	u3572	m235	PAUL	... all this and a jam butty too!!
L15505	u3572	m235	PAUL	What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
L15504	u3567	m235	GIRL	Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
L15503	u3572	m235	PAUL	We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
L15502	u3567	m235	GIRL	I bet you don't sound like real people.
L15501	u3572	m235	PAUL	I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
L15500	u3567	m235	GIRL	What are you?
L15499	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
L15498	u3567	m235	GIRL	They ought to be.
L15497	u3572	m235	PAUL	Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
L15496	u3567	m235	GIRL	But that's not like a real person at all.
L15495	u3572	m235	PAUL	No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
L15494	u3567	m235	GIRL	But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
L15493	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh aye, a sledge.
L15492	u3567	m235	GIRL	The big hammer?
L15491	u3572	m235	PAUL	"Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  ""I don't believe you, sir..."" and all that. Yeah, it was gear."
L15490	u3567	m235	GIRL	What's that mean?
L15489	u3572	m235	PAUL	Aye, I knew you were.
L15488	u3567	m235	GIRL	Yes.
L15487	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
L15486	u3567	m235	GIRL	No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
L15485	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
L15484	u3567	m235	GIRL	I'm not ...
L15483	u3572	m235	PAUL	You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
L15482	u3572	m235	PAUL	Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
L15481	u3567	m235	GIRL	Thank you.
L15480	u3572	m235	PAUL	Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
L15479	u3567	m235	GIRL	Gear?
L15478	u3572	m235	PAUL	Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
L15477	u3567	m235	GIRL	I see.  Do you like the play?
L15476	u3572	m235	PAUL	Something like that.
L15475	u3567	m235	GIRL	Are you pulling my leg?
L15474	u3572	m235	PAUL	Is it ... is it, really?
L15473	u3567	m235	GIRL	Oh, it's the way you talk.
L15472	u3572	m235	PAUL	How'd you guess?
L15471	u3567	m235	GIRL	You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
L15470	u3572	m235	PAUL	"D'you know something, ""They"" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ..."
L15469	u3567	m235	GIRL	I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
L15468	u3572	m235	PAUL	I've got you worried, haven't I?
L15467	u3567	m235	GIRL	Are you supposed to be here?
L15466	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, sorry I spoke.
L15465	u3567	m235	GIRL	Go away! You've spoilt it.
L15464	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
L15463	u3567	m235	GIRL	Oh!
L15594	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Nothing good.
L15593	u3574	m235	RINGO	What are they saying?
L15592	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Lip reading.
L15591	u3574	m235	RINGO	What are you doing?
L15584	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
L15583	u3574	m235	RINGO	Oh, they seem all right to me.
L15582	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
L15581	u3574	m235	RINGO	Me!
L15580	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
L15579	u3574	m235	RINGO	Have they?
L15578	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
L15577	u3574	m235	RINGO	What?
L15576	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
L15575	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
L15574	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
L15343	u3574	m235	RINGO	I'm going parading before it's too late!
L15342	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Where are you off to?
L15341	u3574	m235	RINGO	I'm not wrong.
L15340	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	You're only right.
L15339	u3574	m235	RINGO	Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
L15338	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
L15337	u3574	m235	RINGO	Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
L15336	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	A book!
L15335	u3574	m235	RINGO	Yeah ... what's in it for me?
L15334	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	And what's it all come to in the end?
L15333	u3574	m235	RINGO	Yeah ... that's right.
L15332	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
L15331	u3574	m235	RINGO	Oh ... I dunno.
L15330	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
L15329	u3574	m235	RINGO	What's that mean?
L15328	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
L15327	u3574	m235	RINGO	Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
L15326	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
L15325	u3574	m235	RINGO	Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
L15324	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
L15323	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
L15322	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
L15321	u3574	m235	RINGO	Parading?
L15320	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Parading's better!
L15319	u3574	m235	RINGO	Books are good!
L15318	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
L15317	u3574	m235	RINGO	Out where?
L15316	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
L15315	u3574	m235	RINGO	You can learn from books.
L15314	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
L15313	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well ... what's the matter with that?
L15312	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
L15014	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
L15013	u3574	m235	RINGO	Ah.
L15586	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	You see, sly villains.
L15585	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	Would you two like a cup of tea?
L15573	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
L15572	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
L15571	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	What's he on about?
L15570	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
L15569	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	Eh?
L15568	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
L15567	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	Is there a fire, then?
L15566	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
L15648	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	But I'm clean.
L15647	u3569	m235	JOHN	You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
L15079	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
L15078	u3569	m235	JOHN	Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
L15001	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
L15000	u3569	m235	JOHN	That'll keep you busy.
L14973	u3569	m235	JOHN	Every morning.
L14972	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
L14873	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
L14872	u3569	m235	JOHN	Come on let's get this coffee.
L14793	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	I'll look after meself.
L14792	u3569	m235	JOHN	And we're looking after him, are we?
L14789	u3569	m235	JOHN	He can talk then?
L14788	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Hello.
L14787	u3569	m235	JOHN	Hello, Grandfather!
L15638	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Here, Pauly.
L15637	u3572	m235	PAUL	And another thing, where's that old mixer?
L15126	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
L15125	u3572	m235	PAUL	Anything to spare?
L14995	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
L14994	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
L14993	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
L14992	u3572	m235	PAUL	With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
L14964	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
L14963	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
L14962	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	Why do you always use your left hand?
L14961	u3572	m235	PAUL	Yeah ... so what?
L14960	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
L14959	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
L14958	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
L14957	u3572	m235	PAUL	All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
L14954	u3572	m235	PAUL	Don't dramatise.
L14953	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
L14939	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, well that's all right.  What?
L14938	u3568	m235	GRANDFATHER	It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
L14937	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
L15214	u3569	m235	JOHN	I think you're soft or something.
L15213	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Hiding.
L15212	u3569	m235	JOHN	What are you doing there?
L15064	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
L15063	u3569	m235	JOHN	Well, what are we waiting for?
L15058	u3577	m235	SHAKE	You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
L15057	u3569	m235	JOHN	Aye, he looks a right lurker.
L15004	u3577	m235	SHAKE	For Ringo.
L15003	u3569	m235	JOHN	Is that yours?
L14809	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Oh yes, he's clean all right.
L14808	u3569	m235	JOHN	Clean though, isn't he?
L14807	u3577	m235	SHAKE	That's all right then.
L14806	u3569	m235	JOHN	No, that's his other one.
L15646	u3569	m235	JOHN	That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
L15645	u3572	m235	PAUL	Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
L15644	u3569	m235	JOHN	Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
L15643	u3572	m235	PAUL	Y'what?
L15642	u3569	m235	JOHN	You needn't bother.
L15641	u3572	m235	PAUL	What's old got to do with it?
L15640	u3569	m235	JOHN	Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
L15639	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
L15351	u3569	m235	JOHN	Can't he? He's done it, son!
L15350	u3572	m235	PAUL	We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
L15301	u3572	m235	PAUL	So's mine.
L15300	u3569	m235	JOHN	She's going to show me her stamp collection.
L15288	u3569	m235	JOHN	Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
L15287	u3572	m235	PAUL	What's he know?
L15280	u3569	m235	JOHN	Foreign devil ...
L15279	u3572	m235	PAUL	Behave...
L15276	u3572	m235	PAUL	Eh, don't take out me lines.
L15275	u3569	m235	JOHN	You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
L15130	u3569	m235	JOHN	Aye, before anyone stops us.
L15129	u3572	m235	PAUL	Let's go and muck in.
L14976	u3569	m235	JOHN	Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
L14975	u3572	m235	PAUL	Like what?
L14974	u3569	m235	JOHN	Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
L14969	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
L14968	u3569	m235	JOHN	Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
L14929	u3572	m235	PAUL	Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
L14928	u3569	m235	JOHN	We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
L14919	u3572	m235	PAUL	Don't be callous.
L14918	u3569	m235	JOHN	I hope he fell off.
L14879	u3572	m235	PAUL	Shall I?
L14878	u3569	m235	JOHN	Give 'em a pull.
L14840	u3572	m235	PAUL	Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
L14839	u3569	m235	JOHN	Gie's a kiss!
L14796	u3572	m235	PAUL	Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
L14795	u3569	m235	JOHN	He's got you worried, then?
L14794	u3572	m235	PAUL	Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
L14786	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
L14785	u3569	m235	JOHN	Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
L14784	u3569	m235	JOHN	Oh, I see.
L14783	u3572	m235	PAUL	No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
L14782	u3569	m235	JOHN	Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
L14774	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
L14773	u3569	m235	JOHN	Well we know that but what's he doing here?
L14772	u3572	m235	PAUL	Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
L14771	u3569	m235	JOHN	How d'you reckon that one out?
L14766	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
L14765	u3569	m235	JOHN	That little old man.
L14764	u3572	m235	PAUL	What little old man?
L14763	u3569	m235	JOHN	Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
L15658	u3571	m235	NORM	You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
L15657	u3569	m235	JOHN	What?
L15656	u3571	m235	NORM	No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
L15655	u3569	m235	JOHN	Now, look here, Norm ...

L15551	u3571	m235	NORM	Aye, let's try the dressing room.

L15284	u3571	m235	NORM	Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
L15267	u3571	m235	NORM	Sit down, the lot of you.

L15191	u3569	m235	JOHN	Aye, but you know him well.
L15190	u3570	m235	MILLIE	I would have said so.
L15189	u3569	m235	JOHN	Is it?
L15188	u3570	m235	MILLIE	Well, yes your nose is. Very.

L15091	u3574	m235	RINGO	It'll only get you into trouble.
L14991	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
L14990	u3569	m235	JOHN	You're a window rattler, son.
L15660	u3571	m235	NORM	Don't start. Look.
L15659	u3572	m235	PAUL	Where's my grandfather?

L15554	u3572	m235	PAUL	Aye, I suppose so.
L15553	u3571	m235	NORM	Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
L15552	u3572	m235	PAUL	Eh, where's my grandfather?
L14914	u3572	m235	PAUL	You've lost him.
L14913	u3571	m235	NORM	Don't exaggerate.
L14912	u3572	m235	PAUL	Have <U>you</U> lost him?
L14867	u3572	m235	PAUL	You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
L14866	u3571	m235	NORM	Y'what?
L14865	u3572	m235	PAUL	I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
L14864	u3571	m235	NORM	Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
L14863	u3572	m235	PAUL	And?
L14826	u3571	m235	NORM	Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.

L15311	u3574	m235	RINGO	Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
L15310	u3571	m235	NORM	Do I have to raise me voice?
L15309	u3574	m235	RINGO	But...
L15308	u3571	m235	NORM	Look after him.
L15273	u3574	m235	RINGO	Someone put it on me.
L15272	u3571	m235	NORM	What do you think are you're up to?
L15265	u3574	m235	RINGO	I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
L15264	u3571	m235	NORM	Stop picking on him.
L15223	u3571	m235	NORM	Good lad, Ringo.
L15222	u3574	m235	RINGO	Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
L15219	u3571	m235	NORM	When I tell you to stay put, stay put.

L14998	u3574	m235	RINGO	None for me, then?
L14821	u3571	m235	NORM	Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
L14820	u3574	m235	RINGO	He belongs to Paul.
L15532	u3571	m235	NORM	Shurrup, cheerful.
L15531	u3577	m235	SHAKE	... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
L15307	u3571	m235	NORM	Clever.  George.
L15306	u3577	m235	SHAKE	I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
L15209	u3571	m235	NORM	I know, that's the trouble.
L15208	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Nerves.
L15207	u3571	m235	NORM	What?
L15206	u3577	m235	SHAKE	But John hasn't got any.
L15205	u3571	m235	NORM	Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
L15204	u3577	m235	SHAKE	You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
L15203	u3571	m235	NORM	He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
L15202	u3571	m235	NORM	That's too easy for Lennon.
L15201	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
L14899	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Well, give a couple of minutes ...
L14898	u3571	m235	NORM	Yeah, down the ... er ...
L14897	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Oh, down the ... er ...?
L14896	u3571	m235	NORM	Down the ... er ...
L14895	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
L14894	u3571	m235	NORM	Paul's grandfather.
L14893	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Who?
L14892	u3571	m235	NORM	He's been gone a long time.
L14857	u3571	m235	NORM	Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
L14856	u3577	m235	SHAKE	I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
L14853	u3577	m235	SHAKE	I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
L14852	u3571	m235	NORM	Well, you stick to that story, son.
L14851	u3577	m235	SHAKE	It's not my fault.
L14850	u3571	m235	NORM	Yeah, you want to watch it.
L15349	u3574	m235	RINGO	Get knotted!
L15348	u3572	m235	PAUL	Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
L15252	u3574	m235	RINGO	You were twanging too loud.
L15251	u3572	m235	PAUL	What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
L15062	u3572	m235	PAUL	Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
L15061	u3574	m235	RINGO	Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
L15010	u3574	m235	RINGO	And they want me?
L15009	u3572	m235	PAUL	The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet. Blimey!
L14791	u3574	m235	RINGO	Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
L14790	u3572	m235	PAUL	Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
L14776	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
L14775	u3574	m235	RINGO	How's that?
L15245	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Oh, anything you say, Paul.
L15244	u3572	m235	PAUL	I'll set John on you!
L15243	u3577	m235	SHAKE	I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
L15242	u3572	m235	PAUL	Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
L15056	u3572	m235	PAUL	Oh, him... He's been lurking.
L15055	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Eh, what's all this?
L14917	u3577	m235	SHAKE	He can't be far.
L14916	u3572	m235	PAUL	You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
L14915	u3577	m235	SHAKE	Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
L15590	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	Well, he can't stop here.
L15589	u3573	m235	POLICEMAN	Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
L15588	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
L15561	u3573	m235	POLICEMAN	A proper Aborigine.
L15560	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	Oh, a little savage, is he?
L15559	u3573	m235	POLICEMAN	I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
L15558	u3576	m235	SERGEANT	What is he?
L199261	u5163	m342	HELEN	No.
L199260	u5156	m342	BUD	Give me the keys.
L199259	u5163	m342	HELEN	It's our goddamn car!
L199258	u5156	m342	BUD	It's my goddamn car!

L199254	u5156	m342	BUD	Give me the keys.
L198480	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
L198479	u5161	m342	FRANK	Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
L198478	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
L198477	u5161	m342	FRANK	So?
L198476	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
L198475	u5161	m342	FRANK	Twelve years.
L198474	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
L198473	u5161	m342	FRANK	What're you saying, Charlie?
L198472	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	It's all there.  Both nights.
L198471	u5161	m342	FRANK	I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
L198470	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	We don't need you, Frankie.
L198469	u5161	m342	FRANK	What about tomorrow?
L198468	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	Take it now.
L198467	u5161	m342	FRANK	Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
L198466	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	Your pay.
L198465	u5161	m342	FRANK	What's this?
L198464	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	Mondays.
L198463	u5161	m342	FRANK	Little slow tonight.
L198462	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	Yeah, come on in.
L198461	u5161	m342	FRANK	You wanted to see me, Charlie?
L198460	u5157	m342	CHARLIE	Frankie.
L198517	u5158	m342	DONNA	Suit yourself.
L198516	u5164	m342	JACK	Just the same.
L198515	u5158	m342	DONNA	We have some lotion.
L198514	u5164	m342	JACK	Maybe next time.
L198513	u5158	m342	DONNA	Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
L198512	u5164	m342	JACK	Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
L198511	u5158	m342	DONNA	Swimming trunks.
L198510	u5164	m342	JACK	Trunks?
L199556	u5158	m342	DONNA	Frank.
L199555	u5161	m342	FRANK	Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
L199554	u5158	m342	DONNA	Honey ...
L199553	u5161	m342	FRANK	You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
L199552	u5158	m342	DONNA	Honey ...
L198509	u5158	m342	DONNA	You bring trunks, Jack?
L198508	u5161	m342	FRANK	Well, look at this.
L198505	u5158	m342	DONNA	I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
L198504	u5161	m342	FRANK	Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
L198863	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
L198862	u5164	m342	JACK	I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
L198861	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
L198860	u5164	m342	JACK	What do you do to him?
L198859	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	No bones.
L198858	u5164	m342	JACK	No bones?
L198857	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
L198856	u5164	m342	JACK	How will he eat?
L198855	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
L198854	u5164	m342	JACK	Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
L198853	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
L198852	u5164	m342	JACK	How many?
L198851	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	They gotta go.
L198850	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
L198849	u5164	m342	JACK	They're falling out.
L198848	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	What's wrong with them?
L198847	u5164	m342	JACK	Teeth.
L198846	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	What's our friend's problem?
L198845	u5164	m342	JACK	Baker.
L198844	u5159	m342	DR. BEASLEY	Beasley.
L199484	u5164	m342	JACK	I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
L199483	u5160	m342	EARL	You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
L199482	u5164	m342	JACK	Go fuck yourself.
L199481	u5160	m342	EARL	Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
L199480	u5164	m342	JACK	Get your hand off me.
L199479	u5160	m342	EARL	What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
L199462	u5160	m342	EARL	The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
L199461	u5164	m342	JACK	Accident?
L199460	u5160	m342	EARL	Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
L199459	u5164	m342	JACK	What's wrong with the kid?
L199458	u5160	m342	EARL	Oh.
L199457	u5164	m342	JACK	My brother and I. One each.
L199456	u5160	m342	EARL	Two at a time?
L199455	u5164	m342	JACK	Piano.
L199454	u5160	m342	EARL	Oh.  What do you do?
L199453	u5164	m342	JACK	No.
L199452	u5160	m342	EARL	You the magician?
L198432	u5161	m342	FRANK	Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
L198431	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
L198430	u5161	m342	FRANK	I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
L198429	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Oh no!
L198428	u5161	m342	FRANK	In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
L198427	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
L198426	u5161	m342	FRANK	Recognize these two characters?
L198425	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Oh my God ...
L198404	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
L198403	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
L198402	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
L198401	u5161	m342	FRANK	Twenty years, Ma ...
L198400	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	I thought maybe held gotten over that.
L198399	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
L198396	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
L198395	u5161	m342	FRANK	How's the birthday girl?
L198394	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
L198359	u5175	m342	WILLIE	My pleasure.
L198358	u5161	m342	FRANK	Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
L198353	u5161	m342	FRANK	Two nights.
L198352	u5175	m342	WILLIE	What's the gig?
L198348	u5175	m342	WILLIE	Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
L198347	u5161	m342	FRANK	When they coming in?
L198346	u5175	m342	WILLIE	Out.
L198345	u5161	m342	FRANK	What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
L199627	u5161	m342	FRANK	I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
L199626	u5164	m342	JACK	She asked for it.
L199625	u5161	m342	FRANK	Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
L199624	u5164	m342	JACK	Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
L199623	u5161	m342	FRANK	Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
L199622	u5164	m342	JACK	Five years ago.  November.
L199621	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
L199620	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah.
L199619	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
L199618	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah?
L199617	u5161	m342	FRANK	Charlie called.
L199616	u5161	m342	FRANK	I can keep the beat.
L199615	u5164	m342	JACK	I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
L199614	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
L199613	u5164	m342	JACK	You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
L199612	u5161	m342	FRANK	Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
L199611	u5164	m342	JACK	How're your hands?
L199609	u5164	m342	JACK	This'll kill 'em.
L199608	u5161	m342	FRANK	Looks like these got a few years on them.
L199607	u5161	m342	FRANK	Good choice.
L199606	u5164	m342	JACK	I'll take the Mallory.
L199605	u5161	m342	FRANK	Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
L199600	u5164	m342	JACK	Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
L199599	u5161	m342	FRANK	No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
L199598	u5164	m342	JACK	Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
L199597	u5161	m342	FRANK	No.
L199596	u5164	m342	JACK	Go ahead.
L199591	u5164	m342	JACK	Sure.
L199590	u5161	m342	FRANK	There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
L199589	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah, fine.
L199588	u5161	m342	FRANK	I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
L199587	u5164	m342	JACK	Right.
L199586	u5161	m342	FRANK	Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
L199585	u5164	m342	JACK	Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
L199584	u5164	m342	JACK	Later.
L199583	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
L199582	u5161	m342	FRANK	Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
L199581	u5164	m342	JACK	What're you doing?
L199580	u5161	m342	FRANK	I didn't hear you come in.
L199515	u5164	m342	JACK	Who's weak now, big brother?
L199514	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack!
L199508	u5161	m342	FRANK	No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
L199507	u5164	m342	JACK	Fuck you.
L199506	u5161	m342	FRANK	That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
L199505	u5164	m342	JACK	You weren't there.
L199504	u5161	m342	FRANK	No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
L199503	u5164	m342	JACK	Stay off it.
L199497	u5161	m342	FRANK	Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
L199496	u5164	m342	JACK	What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
L199495	u5161	m342	FRANK	It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
L199494	u5164	m342	JACK	What?
L199493	u5161	m342	FRANK	I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
L199492	u5164	m342	JACK	Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
L199491	u5161	m342	FRANK	Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
L199490	u5164	m342	JACK	What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
L199478	u5164	m342	JACK	Shut up, Frank.
L199477	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack, you're on television.
L199467	u5161	m342	FRANK	What?
L199466	u5164	m342	JACK	We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
L199465	u5161	m342	FRANK	What?
L199464	u5164	m342	JACK	Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
L199463	u5161	m342	FRANK	We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
L199446	u5161	m342	FRANK	A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
L199445	u5164	m342	JACK	Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
L199444	u5161	m342	FRANK	Seventy-one
L199443	u5164	m342	JACK	What channels it on?
L199442	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
L199441	u5164	m342	JACK	You don't know?
L199440	u5161	m342	FRANK	I don't know.
L199439	u5164	m342	JACK	What disease?
L199438	u5161	m342	FRANK	I don't know. Some disease.
L199437	u5164	m342	JACK	What's it for?
L199436	u5161	m342	FRANK	I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
L199435	u5164	m342	JACK	Nothing. We get nothing.
L199434	u5161	m342	FRANK	No.
L199433	u5164	m342	JACK	We're not getting paid then.
L199391	u5164	m342	JACK	Twenty-eight years.
L199390	u5161	m342	FRANK	You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
L199382	u5164	m342	JACK	Better give her pneumonia.
L199381	u5161	m342	FRANK	You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
L199380	u5164	m342	JACK	Cancel, Frank.
L199379	u5161	m342	FRANK	Just until we find another girl.
L199378	u5164	m342	JACK	What're you doing?
L199270	u5164	m342	JACK	I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
L199269	u5161	m342	FRANK	Be reasonable, Jack.
L199268	u5164	m342	JACK	I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
L199267	u5161	m342	FRANK	What do you mean?
L199266	u5164	m342	JACK	I can't make the tenth.
L199265	u5161	m342	FRANK	What?
L199264	u5164	m342	JACK	The tenth's out.
L199263	u5161	m342	FRANK	That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
L199250	u5161	m342	FRANK	Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
L199249	u5164	m342	JACK	You're making things up, Frank.
L199248	u5161	m342	FRANK	I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
L199247	u5164	m342	JACK	You could've come.
L199246	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
L199245	u5164	m342	JACK	It was just a can of beer, Frank.
L199244	u5161	m342	FRANK	It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
L199243	u5164	m342	JACK	He was just having fun.
L199242	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
L199241	u5164	m342	JACK	You always threw up.
L199240	u5161	m342	FRANK	I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
L199239	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah.
L199238	u5161	m342	FRANK	God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
L199237	u5164	m342	JACK	I told you.  It's a useless talent.
L199236	u5161	m342	FRANK	Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
L199235	u5164	m342	JACK	They were simple songs.
L199234	u5161	m342	FRANK	Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
L199233	u5164	m342	JACK	A useless talent.
L199232	u5161	m342	FRANK	Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
L199231	u5164	m342	JACK	April.
L199230	u5161	m342	FRANK	February?
L199229	u5164	m342	JACK	Couple years.
L199228	u5161	m342	FRANK	Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
L199227	u5164	m342	JACK	The Royal.
L199224	u5161	m342	FRANK	A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
L199223	u5164	m342	JACK	Expensive hangover.
L199222	u5161	m342	FRANK	No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
L199221	u5164	m342	JACK	The party's over.
L199220	u5161	m342	FRANK	Celebrating.  Join me?
L199219	u5164	m342	JACK	What're you doing down here?
L199202	u5164	m342	JACK	You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
L199201	u5161	m342	FRANK	How come I didn't hear anything?
L199200	u5164	m342	JACK	He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
L199199	u5161	m342	FRANK	He was wearing a suit.
L199198	u5164	m342	JACK	We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
L199197	u5161	m342	FRANK	What are you talking about?
L199196	u5164	m342	JACK	He's with the hotel.  I called him.
L199195	u5161	m342	FRANK	Huh?
L199194	u5164	m342	JACK	You saw wrong.
L199191	u5161	m342	FRANK	We were just having a little discussion about morality.
L199190	u5164	m342	JACK	What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
L199170	u5161	m342	FRANK	Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
L199169	u5164	m342	JACK	What?
L199168	u5161	m342	FRANK	Funny, huh?
L199158	u5161	m342	FRANK	Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
L199157	u5164	m342	JACK	What the hell are these?
L199156	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
L199155	u5164	m342	JACK	She's a big girl.
L199154	u5161	m342	FRANK	Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
L199153	u5164	m342	JACK	No. Why?
L199152	u5161	m342	FRANK	You haven't seen Susie, have you?
L199149	u5164	m342	JACK	Time flies, huh?
L199148	u5161	m342	FRANK	Two hours ago!
L199147	u5164	m342	JACK	They stopped serving two hours ago.
L199146	u5161	m342	FRANK	Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
L199145	u5164	m342	JACK	How long you been at it?
L199144	u5161	m342	FRANK	Fine.
L199143	u5164	m342	JACK	How's it coming?
L199142	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
L199141	u5164	m342	JACK	Really.
L199140	u5161	m342	FRANK	What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
L199139	u5164	m342	JACK	What the hell are you doing?
L199124	u5164	m342	JACK	It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
L199123	u5161	m342	FRANK	How dare you say you love me.
L199122	u5164	m342	JACK	I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
L199121	u5161	m342	FRANK	What's the matter with you?
L199115	u5164	m342	JACK	I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
L199114	u5161	m342	FRANK	What?
L199113	u5164	m342	JACK	Right.  I love you, Frank.
L199112	u5161	m342	FRANK	Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
L199107	u5161	m342	FRANK	Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
L199106	u5164	m342	JACK	Because I can hear it.
L199105	u5161	m342	FRANK	What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
L199104	u5164	m342	JACK	Doesn't it matter to you?
L199103	u5161	m342	FRANK	No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
L199102	u5164	m342	JACK	Christ, can't you hear it?
L199101	u5161	m342	FRANK	What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
L199100	u5164	m342	JACK	No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
L199099	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
L199097	u5164	m342	JACK	Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
L199096	u5161	m342	FRANK	I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
L199095	u5164	m342	JACK	Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
L199075	u5161	m342	FRANK	I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
L199074	u5164	m342	JACK	Why would I mind?
L199073	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah.  You mind?
L199072	u5164	m342	JACK	So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
L199071	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah.
L199070	u5164	m342	JACK	We're gonna be here a week?
L199069	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah.
L199068	u5164	m342	JACK	All night?
L199067	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah.
L199066	u5164	m342	JACK	You leaving that on?
L199065	u5164	m342	JACK	Right.
L199064	u5161	m342	FRANK	But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
L199063	u5164	m342	JACK	Good idea.
L199062	u5161	m342	FRANK	I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
L199061	u5164	m342	JACK	Okay.
L199060	u5161	m342	FRANK	We might as well do the towels the same way.
L199059	u5164	m342	JACK	No, you take the right.
L199058	u5161	m342	FRANK	Unless you want the right.
L199057	u5164	m342	JACK	Right.
L199056	u5161	m342	FRANK	I figure that way we won't get confused.
L199055	u5164	m342	JACK	Okay.
L199054	u5161	m342	FRANK	I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
L199053	u5161	m342	FRANK	Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
L199052	u5164	m342	JACK	Have some more wine, Frank.
L199049	u5161	m342	FRANK	Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
L199048	u5164	m342	JACK	He's drunk.
L199039	u5161	m342	FRANK	A few bars!
L199038	u5164	m342	JACK	Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
L199037	u5161	m342	FRANK	Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
L199036	u5164	m342	JACK	We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
L199035	u5161	m342	FRANK	It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
L199034	u5164	m342	JACK	She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
L199029	u5161	m342	FRANK	Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
L199028	u5164	m342	JACK	I thought we all had separate rooms.
L199027	u5161	m342	FRANK	We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
L199026	u5164	m342	JACK	I thought we had separate rooms.
L199004	u5164	m342	JACK	Sunday.
L199003	u5161	m342	FRANK	Last?
L199002	u5164	m342	JACK	Day.  Wednesday.
L199001	u5161	m342	FRANK	First night?
L199000	u5164	m342	JACK	November.  '71.
L198994	u5164	m342	JACK	Two years ago.  March.
L198993	u5161	m342	FRANK	When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
L198946	u5161	m342	FRANK	All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
L198945	u5164	m342	JACK	Thanks, but I've got plans.
L198944	u5161	m342	FRANK	You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
L198943	u5161	m342	FRANK	Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
L198942	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah.
L198941	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
L198940	u5164	m342	JACK	Very realistic.
L198939	u5161	m342	FRANK	So what do you think?
L198938	u5164	m342	JACK	Just a lucky guess.
L198937	u5161	m342	FRANK	You recognized me.
L198936	u5164	m342	JACK	Hey, Frank.
L198895	u5164	m342	JACK	Right.
L198894	u5161	m342	FRANK	Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
L198893	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah, fine.
L198892	u5161	m342	FRANK	You all right?
L198890	u5164	m342	JACK	You wanna get a drink?
L198889	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
L198888	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah.  Something.
L198887	u5161	m342	FRANK	Something, huh?  All those bids.
L198886	u5164	m342	JACK	I'll take my chances.
L198885	u5161	m342	FRANK	Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
L198879	u5161	m342	FRANK	That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
L198878	u5164	m342	JACK	Make it collect.
L198875	u5161	m342	FRANK	That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
L198874	u5164	m342	JACK	Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
L198802	u5161	m342	FRANK	And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
L198801	u5164	m342	JACK	Oh, brother.
L198759	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
L198758	u5164	m342	JACK	How about these?
L198757	u5161	m342	FRANK	See anything?
L198749	u5161	m342	FRANK	Here, how's this?
L198748	u5164	m342	JACK	No.
L198721	u5164	m342	JACK	She's here.
L198720	u5161	m342	FRANK	I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
L198719	u5164	m342	JACK	You're a fucking alarm clock.
L198718	u5161	m342	FRANK	All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
L198717	u5164	m342	JACK	I told you I was gonna hit you.
L198716	u5161	m342	FRANK	You hit me.
L198715	u5164	m342	JACK	I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
L198714	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's not gonna hurt you.
L198713	u5164	m342	JACK	Get out of here!
L198712	u5161	m342	FRANK	Come on, stand still.
L198711	u5164	m342	JACK	Get out of here.
L198710	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
L198709	u5164	m342	JACK	Awe inspiring.
L198708	u5161	m342	FRANK	Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
L198707	u5164	m342	JACK	She'll get here.
L198706	u5161	m342	FRANK	I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
L198705	u5164	m342	JACK	It's early.
L198704	u5161	m342	FRANK	Where the hell is she?
L198671	u5161	m342	FRANK	Okay?
L198670	u5164	m342	JACK	I'll drop the eighths.
L198669	u5161	m342	FRANK	I suppose we can bring it down a little.
L198649	u5161	m342	FRANK	I didn't get her number.
L198648	u5164	m342	JACK	What's the matter?
L198647	u5161	m342	FRANK	Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
L198646	u5164	m342	JACK	How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
L198645	u5164	m342	JACK	Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
L198644	u5161	m342	FRANK	I was just thinking what Ma would think.
L198643	u5164	m342	JACK	You're getting cold feet about this.
L198642	u5161	m342	FRANK	I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
L198641	u5164	m342	JACK	What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
L198640	u5161	m342	FRANK	I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
L198639	u5164	m342	JACK	What are you, crazy?
L198623	u5161	m342	FRANK	All right.  What's your name?
L198622	u5164	m342	JACK	Let's get it over with.
L198621	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack.
L198591	u5161	m342	FRANK	I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
L198590	u5164	m342	JACK	It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
L198589	u5161	m342	FRANK	Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
L198588	u5164	m342	JACK	What?
L198587	u5161	m342	FRANK	Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
L198558	u5164	m342	JACK	It never was.
L198557	u5161	m342	FRANK	Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
L198556	u5164	m342	JACK	You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
L198555	u5161	m342	FRANK	What's that?
L198554	u5161	m342	FRANK	I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
L198553	u5164	m342	JACK	I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
L198552	u5161	m342	FRANK	I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
L198551	u5164	m342	JACK	Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
L198550	u5161	m342	FRANK	If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
L198549	u5164	m342	JACK	I'm not unhappy.
L198548	u5161	m342	FRANK	If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
L198547	u5164	m342	JACK	That's what we agreed.
L198546	u5161	m342	FRANK	We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
L198545	u5164	m342	JACK	It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
L198544	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
L198543	u5164	m342	JACK	Sure, why not.
L198542	u5161	m342	FRANK	I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
L198541	u5164	m342	JACK	Talk.
L198540	u5161	m342	FRANK	Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
L198539	u5164	m342	JACK	Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
L198538	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah, and what put him up there?
L198537	u5164	m342	JACK	A gust of wind killed him.
L198534	u5164	m342	JACK	That how you see it?
L198533	u5161	m342	FRANK	Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
L198532	u5164	m342	JACK	What was it like?
L198531	u5161	m342	FRANK	No.
L198530	u5164	m342	JACK	No?
L198529	u5161	m342	FRANK	It wasn't like that.
L198528	u5164	m342	JACK	Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
L198527	u5161	m342	FRANK	I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
L198526	u5164	m342	JACK	The hell you don't.
L198525	u5161	m342	FRANK	I don't know what you mean.
L198524	u5164	m342	JACK	Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
L198523	u5164	m342	JACK	You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
L198522	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
L198521	u5164	m342	JACK	Terrific.
L198520	u5161	m342	FRANK	The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
L198519	u5164	m342	JACK	What?
L198518	u5161	m342	FRANK	Nice, huh?
L198502	u5161	m342	FRANK	Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
L198501	u5164	m342	JACK	Your doorbell doesn't work.
L198500	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack.
L198494	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah, okay.
L198493	u5161	m342	FRANK	So you'll come out, right?
L198492	u5161	m342	FRANK	Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
L198491	u5164	m342	JACK	What're you talking about?
L198490	u5161	m342	FRANK	We don't get a gig.
L198489	u5164	m342	JACK	So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
L198488	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's not family.  It's business.
L198487	u5164	m342	JACK	I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
L198486	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
L198485	u5164	m342	JACK	Frank?
L198484	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's me.
L198483	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah?
L198482	u5161	m342	FRANK	Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
L198481	u5164	m342	JACK	What's with Charlie?
L198437	u5164	m342	JACK	Her hands.  Like that.
L198436	u5161	m342	FRANK	What do you mean?
L198435	u5164	m342	JACK	I made her nervous.
L198393	u5161	m342	FRANK	You'll see.
L198392	u5164	m342	JACK	So what'd we get her?
L198387	u5161	m342	FRANK	Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
L198386	u5164	m342	JACK	You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
L198385	u5161	m342	FRANK	Your older brother.
L198384	u5164	m342	JACK	Says who?
L198383	u5161	m342	FRANK	You gotta go.
L198382	u5164	m342	JACK	I don't gotta go.
L198381	u5161	m342	FRANK	This time you gotta go.
L198380	u5164	m342	JACK	No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
L198379	u5161	m342	FRANK	We gotta go, Jack.
L198378	u5164	m342	JACK	So do I.
L198377	u5161	m342	FRANK	No, I mean it.
L198376	u5164	m342	JACK	No thanks.
L198375	u5161	m342	FRANK	By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
L198374	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's more than that.
L198373	u5164	m342	JACK	It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
L198372	u5161	m342	FRANK	Funny.  Strike a bell?
L198371	u5164	m342	JACK	Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
L198370	u5161	m342	FRANK	What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
L198369	u5164	m342	JACK	I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
L198368	u5161	m342	FRANK	Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
L198367	u5164	m342	JACK	Why the interest?
L198366	u5161	m342	FRANK	Seeing anyone in particular?
L198365	u5164	m342	JACK	Only on odd days.
L198364	u5161	m342	FRANK	Really.  You sleeping?
L198363	u5164	m342	JACK	Thanks.
L198362	u5161	m342	FRANK	You look awful.
L198361	u5164	m342	JACK	Trust me, you're not missing anything.
L198360	u5161	m342	FRANK	You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
L198357	u5164	m342	JACK	Try the black Knable.
L198356	u5161	m342	FRANK	What do you think?
L198355	u5164	m342	JACK	Yamaha white.  Nice.
L198354	u5161	m342	FRANK	What d'ya got?
L198351	u5161	m342	FRANK	What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
L198350	u5164	m342	JACK	Bosen black.  Flat.
L198349	u5161	m342	FRANK	What d'ya got?,
L198340	u5161	m342	FRANK	Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
L198339	u5164	m342	JACK	You got weird kids, Frank.
L198338	u5161	m342	FRANK	She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
L198337	u5164	m342	JACK	She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
L198336	u5161	m342	FRANK	Cindy.
L198335	u5164	m342	JACK	It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
L198334	u5161	m342	FRANK	It was an accident.
L198333	u5164	m342	JACK	They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
L198332	u5161	m342	FRANK	They don't.  They're always asking about you.
L198331	u5164	m342	JACK	Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
L198330	u5161	m342	FRANK	You're their uncle.
L198329	u5164	m342	JACK	I hate your kids, Frank.
L198328	u5161	m342	FRANK	Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
L198326	u5161	m342	FRANK	Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
L198325	u5164	m342	JACK	So we on tomorrow night?
L198324	u5161	m342	FRANK	Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
L198323	u5164	m342	JACK	Fuck him.
L198322	u5161	m342	FRANK	This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
L198321	u5164	m342	JACK	Fuck him.
L198320	u5161	m342	FRANK	You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
L198318	u5164	m342	JACK	Count the fucking money, Frank.
L198317	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack...
L198316	u5164	m342	JACK	Count it.
L198315	u5161	m342	FRANK	Huh?
L198314	u5164	m342	JACK	Count it.
L198303	u5164	m342	JACK	Like an angel.
L198302	u5161	m342	FRANK	I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
L198297	u5164	m342	JACK	Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
L198296	u5161	m342	FRANK	Don't make trouble, all right?
L198290	u5161	m342	FRANK	Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
L198289	u5164	m342	JACK	Lotta water.
L198288	u5161	m342	FRANK	That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
L198287	u5164	m342	JACK	Twenty-eight years, Frank.
L198286	u5161	m342	FRANK	You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
L198283	u5164	m342	JACK	No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
L198282	u5161	m342	FRANK	You look like you just crawled out of bed.
L198281	u5164	m342	JACK	What's wrong with it?
L198280	u5161	m342	FRANK	Christ, will you look at your hair?
L198279	u5164	m342	JACK	Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
L198278	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack.
L198277	u5164	m342	JACK	Frank.
L198276	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack.
L198275	u5164	m342	JACK	You want me to show up late a few nights?
L198274	u5161	m342	FRANK	You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
L198273	u5164	m342	JACK	What's the point?
L198272	u5161	m342	FRANK	That's not the point.
L198271	u5164	m342	JACK	Am I late?
L198270	u5161	m342	FRANK	How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
L198269	u5164	m342	JACK	How we doing?
L198268	u5161	m342	FRANK	Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
L199430	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	All right.
L199429	u5161	m342	FRANK	Your limo's ready, Ma.
L199409	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	All right.
L199408	u5161	m342	FRANK	A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
L199407	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	Just call me a cab.
L199406	u5161	m342	FRANK	You sure?
L199403	u5161	m342	FRANK	No, we're not.  Jack?
L199402	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	No, no.  You boys are tired.
L199401	u5161	m342	FRANK	I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
L199400	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
L199399	u5161	m342	FRANK	The audience was a little off tonight.
L199398	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	Thrilling.  Both of you.
L199397	u5161	m342	FRANK	So what'd you think?
L199396	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	Spur of the moment.
L199395	u5161	m342	FRANK	You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
L199377	u5171	m342	NICK	What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
L199376	u5161	m342	FRANK	Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
L199375	u5171	m342	NICK	You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
L199374	u5161	m342	FRANK	Doctor's orders.
L199373	u5171	m342	NICK	So she's got a few sniffles.
L199372	u5161	m342	FRANK	The flu.
L199371	u5171	m342	NICK	Sick?  How sick?
L198584	u5167	m342	MONICA	Well ... thanks.  Bye.
L198583	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yes, it is.
L198582	u5167	m342	MONICA	Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
L198576	u5167	m342	MONICA	Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
L198575	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh... he knows it.
L198573	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's one of Jack's favorites.
L198572	u5167	m342	MONICA	Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
L198571	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
L198570	u5167	m342	MONICA	And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
L198569	u5161	m342	FRANK	Right.
L198568	u5167	m342	MONICA	But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
L198567	u5161	m342	FRANK	Well, that's fine --
L198566	u5167	m342	MONICA	No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
L198565	u5161	m342	FRANK	Blanche.
L198564	u5167	m342	MONICA	Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
L198563	u5161	m342	FRANK	I'm sorry?
L198562	u5167	m342	MONICA	Actually, that's my stage name.
L199161	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
L199160	u5176	m342	WOMAN	I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
L198625	u5161	m342	FRANK	Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
L198624	u5176	m342	WOMAN	Susie.  Susie Diamond.
L198618	u5176	m342	WOMAN	What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
L198617	u5161	m342	FRANK	Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
L198614	u5176	m342	WOMAN	You find a girl?
L198613	u5161	m342	FRANK	Miss --
L198612	u5176	m342	WOMAN	So run a little longer.
L198611	u5161	m342	FRANK	We ran long.
L198610	u5176	m342	WOMAN	So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
L198609	u5161	m342	FRANK	You're an hour and a half late.
L198608	u5176	m342	WOMAN	I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
L198607	u5161	m342	FRANK	Impersonally.
L198606	u5176	m342	WOMAN	How should I take it?
L198605	u5161	m342	FRANK	Don't take it personally.
L198604	u5176	m342	WOMAN	Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
L198603	u5161	m342	FRANK	Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
L198602	u5176	m342	WOMAN	This is show business?
L198601	u5161	m342	FRANK	Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
L198600	u5176	m342	WOMAN	My watch is broken, too.
L198599	u5161	m342	FRANK	You're an hour and a half late.
L198598	u5176	m342	WOMAN	What about me?
L198597	u5161	m342	FRANK	We're finished.
L198596	u5176	m342	WOMAN	What do you mean?
L198595	u5161	m342	FRANK	This is where the auditions were.
L198594	u5176	m342	WOMAN	This where the auditions are?
L199281	u5173	m342	SUSIE	And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
L199280	u5161	m342	FRANK	Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
L199279	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
L199278	u5161	m342	FRANK	What're you talking about?  They love it.
L199277	u5173	m342	SUSIE	That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
L199276	u5161	m342	FRANK	What?
L199275	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I can't sing it anymore.
L199273	u5161	m342	FRANK	Forget it.
L199272	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Huh?
L199271	u5161	m342	FRANK	How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
L199204	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Forget it.
L199203	u5161	m342	FRANK	I guess I ... If I jumped to...
L199193	u5161	m342	FRANK	I just saw a man walk out of your room!
L199192	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Some discussion.
L199188	u5161	m342	FRANK	No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
L199187	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
L199186	u5161	m342	FRANK	In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
L199185	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Uh ...
L199184	u5161	m342	FRANK	I just saw a man walk out of your room.
L199183	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Huh?
L199182	u5161	m342	FRANK	You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
L199181	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
L199126	u5161	m342	FRANK	Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
L199125	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What's with you guys?
L199120	u5161	m342	FRANK	Well then ... shall we?
L199119	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
L199118	u5161	m342	FRANK	Got another song for us?
L199117	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Huh?
L199116	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
L199110	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
L199109	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What's with you two?
L199051	u5161	m342	FRANK	He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
L199050	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh yeah?
L199047	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
L199046	u5161	m342	FRANK	What do you say we send a bottle over?
L199045	u5173	m342	SUSIE	They must've bought the same map we did.
L199044	u5161	m342	FRANK	Hey, will you look at that?
L199043	u5161	m342	FRANK	No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
L199042	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Wow. You ever see her again?
L199041	u5161	m342	FRANK	People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
L199040	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What'd she sing?
L199033	u5161	m342	FRANK	Tell her.
L199032	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Peggy Lee?
L199031	u5161	m342	FRANK	As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
L199030	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You're kidding me.
L199025	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yeah.
L199024	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Great?
L199023	u5161	m342	FRANK	Great.
L199022	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey, we're connected.
L199013	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
L199012	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Smells like tuna number two to me.
L199011	u5161	m342	FRANK	Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
L199010	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Smells like fish.
L199009	u5161	m342	FRANK	And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
L199006	u5161	m342	FRANK	I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
L199005	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I don't believe it.
L198999	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack?
L198998	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
L198997	u5161	m342	FRANK	Go ahead.
L198996	u5161	m342	FRANK	He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
L198995	u5173	m342	SUSIE	He's right.
L198992	u5161	m342	FRANK	First times. Hey, look at this.
L198991	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Virgins?
L198990	u5161	m342	FRANK	Virgins.
L198989	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
L198988	u5161	m342	FRANK	Baker's unabridged.
L198987	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You play all these places?
L198983	u5161	m342	FRANK	Sorry.  It only plays static.
L198982	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
L198981	u5161	m342	FRANK	You two could play checkers.
L198948	u5161	m342	FRANK	For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
L198947	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
L198883	u5173	m342	SUSIE	So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
L198882	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
L198877	u5161	m342	FRANK	Maybe.  I'll call him.
L198876	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Maybe it's legit.
L198873	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey.
L198872	u5161	m342	FRANK	By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
L198868	u5173	m342	SUSIE	We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
L198867	u5161	m342	FRANK	I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
L198866	u5173	m342	SUSIE	The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
L198865	u5161	m342	FRANK	Jack, you with us?
L198823	u5161	m342	FRANK	We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
L198822	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I was gonna split it with you guys.
L198821	u5161	m342	FRANK	We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
L198820	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey!
L198819	u5161	m342	FRANK	Give me that.
L198818	u5173	m342	SUSIE	For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
L198817	u5161	m342	FRANK	Fucking.
L198814	u5161	m342	FRANK	Did you hear it?
L198813	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I said I was sorry.
L198812	u5161	m342	FRANK	Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
L198804	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Switch?  What fucking switch?
L198803	u5161	m342	FRANK	The switch.  Hit the switch.
L198788	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Piece of cake.
L198787	u5161	m342	FRANK	Right.
L198786	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
L198785	u5161	m342	FRANK	We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
L198778	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You're a prince.
L198777	u5161	m342	FRANK	Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
L198776	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh, thanks.
L198775	u5161	m342	FRANK	You can buy new ones tomorrow.
L198774	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
L198773	u5161	m342	FRANK	They're nines.
L198772	u5173	m342	SUSIE	They're tight.
L198771	u5161	m342	FRANK	Right.
L198770	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Shoes?
L198769	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Zip me up?
L198768	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh... good.
L198767	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What do you think?
L198756	u5161	m342	FRANK	Big feet.
L198755	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Nine!
L198754	u5161	m342	FRANK	Nine?
L198753	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Nine.
L198752	u5161	m342	FRANK	All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
L198751	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
L198747	u5161	m342	FRANK	We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
L198746	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Save it for your wife.
L198745	u5161	m342	FRANK	Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
L198744	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I wear a seven.
L198743	u5161	m342	FRANK	My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
L198742	u5173	m342	SUSIE	A seven.
L198741	u5161	m342	FRANK	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
L198740	u5173	m342	SUSIE	If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
L198739	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Time for what?
L198738	u5161	m342	FRANK	Come on.  We don't have much time.
L198737	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey!
L198736	u5161	m342	FRANK	Come on.
L198735	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Am I missing something?
L198734	u5161	m342	FRANK	It's orange!
L198733	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What's wrong with it?
L198732	u5161	m342	FRANK	That!  You can't wear that!
L198731	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Do I look like I'm naked?
L198730	u5161	m342	FRANK	Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
L198729	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What's he talking about?
L198728	u5161	m342	FRANK	Where's your dress?
L198727	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Changed?
L198726	u5161	m342	FRANK	We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
L198725	u5173	m342	SUSIE	And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
L198724	u5161	m342	FRANK	What-?
L198723	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Where's my name?
L198722	u5161	m342	FRANK	Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
L198668	u5173	m342	SUSIE	So work with me, not against me. Okay?
L198667	u5161	m342	FRANK	We're a team.  We work together.
L198666	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What I mean is --
L198665	u5161	m342	FRANK	No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
L198664	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
L198662	u5173	m342	SUSIE	The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
L198661	u5161	m342	FRANK	What's the problem?
L198658	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
L198657	u5161	m342	FRANK	Ready?
L198637	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
L198636	u5161	m342	FRANK	When we know.
L198635	u5173	m342	SUSIE	When?
L198634	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh ... we'll let you know.
L198633	u5173	m342	SUSIE	So?
L198630	u5161	m342	FRANK	That's the premise.
L198629	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I sing now?
L198628	u5161	m342	FRANK	Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
L198627	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
L199090	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh, well ...
L199089	u5168	m342	MR. DANIELS	Is that important?
L199088	u5161	m342	FRANK	They are in tune.  But not with each other.
L199087	u5168	m342	MR. DANIELS	Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
L199086	u5161	m342	FRANK	Yes, well, they are.
L199085	u5168	m342	MR. DANIELS	Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
L199084	u5161	m342	FRANK	That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
L199083	u5168	m342	MR. DANIELS	Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
L198829	u5161	m342	FRANK	We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
L198828	u5166	m342	LLOYD	Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
L198827	u5161	m342	FRANK	Born and bred.
L198826	u5166	m342	LLOYD	Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
L198313	u5166	m342	LLOYD	I'll call you.
L198312	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
L198311	u5166	m342	LLOYD	I'll call you.
L198310	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
L198307	u5161	m342	FRANK	Uh ... thanks.
L198306	u5166	m342	LLOYD	Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
L198305	u5161	m342	FRANK	Thanks, Lloyd.
L198304	u5166	m342	LLOYD	Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
L198255	u5162	m342	GIRL	I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
L198254	u5164	m342	JACK	Thanks.
L198253	u5162	m342	GIRL	Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
L198252	u5164	m342	JACK	Brought it.
L198249	u5162	m342	GIRL	Will I see you again?
L198248	u5164	m342	JACK	Funny job.
L198247	u5162	m342	GIRL	Funny hours.
L198246	u5164	m342	JACK	Job.
L198245	u5162	m342	GIRL	How come?
L198244	u5164	m342	JACK	Gotta go.
L198243	u5162	m342	GIRL	Whatcha doin' over there?
L198841	u5176	m342	WOMAN	Right.  In there.
L198840	u5164	m342	JACK	Baker.
L198839	u5176	m342	WOMAN	They never do, Mr. Barker.
L198838	u5164	m342	JACK	He doesn't bite.
L198837	u5176	m342	WOMAN	You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
L198836	u5164	m342	JACK	Come on, Ed.
L198835	u5176	m342	WOMAN	Right.  Bring him back.
L198834	u5164	m342	JACK	Baker.  Jack Baker.
L198833	u5176	m342	WOMAN	Barker.  Jock Barker?
L198620	u5176	m342	WOMAN	You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
L198619	u5164	m342	JACK	Don't worry about it.
L198616	u5176	m342	WOMAN	So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
L198615	u5164	m342	JACK	No.
L198930	u5165	m342	KID	All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
L198929	u5164	m342	JACK	Black.  Labrador.
L198928	u5165	m342	KID	Save it.  What's he look like?
L198927	u5164	m342	JACK	The name's Baker --
L198926	u5165	m342	KID	All right.  Hold on.
L198925	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah.
L198924	u5165	m342	KID	You want to know if he's okay. Right?
L198923	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
L198922	u5165	m342	KID	You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
L198921	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
L198920	u5165	m342	KID	Regular hours are eight to five.
L198919	u5164	m342	JACK	No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
L199426	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
L199425	u5164	m342	JACK	It's been a long time, Ma.
L199424	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	You miss him, don't you?
L199422	u5164	m342	JACK	I suppose.
L199421	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
L199420	u5164	m342	JACK	For a while.  She left.
L199419	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
L199418	u5164	m342	JACK	Pretty much.
L199417	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	Is that the way it is?
L199416	u5164	m342	JACK	He leads, I follow.
L199415	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	And you don't?
L199414	u5164	m342	JACK	Frank works hard.
L199413	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	It went well tonight.
L199405	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
L199404	u5164	m342	JACK	No.
L198407	u5164	m342	JACK	Downstairs.
L198406	u5169	m342	MRS.  BAKER	Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
L199574	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
L199573	u5164	m342	JACK	Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
L199572	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah.
L199571	u5164	m342	JACK	I didn't want to wake you.
L199570	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
L199567	u5164	m342	JACK	No.
L199566	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Let me get the light.
L199563	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
L199562	u5164	m342	JACK	Hi.
L199561	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Jack.
L199545	u5164	m342	JACK	If I see him.
L199544	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
L199542	u5164	m342	JACK	I've given it up.
L199541	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
L199540	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
L199539	u5164	m342	JACK	Vegetables.
L199538	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Huh?
L199537	u5164	m342	JACK	What kind?
L199536	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
L199535	u5164	m342	JACK	So how's the cat food business?
L199534	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah.
L199533	u5164	m342	JACK	You don't pick your brother.
L199532	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
L199531	u5164	m342	JACK	We outgrew each other.
L199530	u5173	m342	SUSIE	So ... ?
L199529	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah.  Got my own sign.
L199528	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
L199370	u5164	m342	JACK	There's always another girl.
L199369	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You can always get another girl.
L199364	u5164	m342	JACK	If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
L199363	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Shit.  I think I started a fire.
L199362	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
L199361	u5164	m342	JACK	Look, if you want to leave...
L199360	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah... No.
L199359	u5164	m342	JACK	Coffee?
L199358	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
L199353	u5164	m342	JACK	Frank wasn't 'there.
L199352	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Frank said ---
L199350	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh.
L199349	u5164	m342	JACK	Ma didn't want it around.  After.
L199348	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
L199347	u5164	m342	JACK	I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
L199346	u5164	m342	JACK	He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
L199345	u5173	m342	SUSIE	So, what happened?
L199344	u5164	m342	JACK	He had a mind that escalated things.
L199343	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You're kidding.
L199342	u5164	m342	JACK	By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
L199341	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Nervous?
L199340	u5164	m342	JACK	They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
L199339	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You sending me home?
L199338	u5164	m342	JACK	Long story.
L199337	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh. So what's it doing here?
L199336	u5164	m342	JACK	He called her.
L199335	u5173	m342	SUSIE	The both of them?  In there?
L199334	u5173	m342	SUSIE	No kidding?
L199333	u5164	m342	JACK	My father proposed to my mother in there.
L199332	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Huh?
L199331	u5164	m342	JACK	History.
L199327	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
L199326	u5164	m342	JACK	Soap?
L199325	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Soap convention.
L199324	u5164	m342	JACK	Must've been a cheap date.
L199323	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
L199319	u5164	m342	JACK	How come you didn't close your eyes?
L199318	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
L199317	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Sure.
L199316	u5164	m342	JACK	I have to make him some chili. Okay?
L199315	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Ed? How many people live here?
L199314	u5164	m342	JACK	She's four feet tall.  Ed?
L199313	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
L199312	u5164	m342	JACK	Friend.
L199311	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Who's Nina?
L199310	u5164	m342	JACK	Nina?
L199308	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
L199307	u5164	m342	JACK	How do you know?
L199306	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You were good.
L199305	u5164	m342	JACK	Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
L199304	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You were good.
L199303	u5164	m342	JACK	It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
L199302	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What's that supposed to mean?
L199301	u5164	m342	JACK	Look. You don't know good. All right?
L199300	u5173	m342	SUSIE	All I said was you were good.
L199299	u5164	m342	JACK	I'm not upset.
L199298	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You're upset.
L199297	u5164	m342	JACK	Nothing.
L199296	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What'd I say?
L199295	u5164	m342	JACK	Nothing.
L199294	u5173	m342	SUSIE	What's the matter?
L199293	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Better than that.
L199292	u5164	m342	JACK	I can keep the beat.
L199288	u5164	m342	JACK	Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
L199287	u5173	m342	SUSIE	How do you do it? Every night?
L199286	u5164	m342	JACK	It's a shitty  song.
L199285	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Guess I got a little scattered.
L199284	u5164	m342	JACK	Relax.  We'll drop the song.
L199210	u5164	m342	JACK	Just dinner and dance, right?
L199209	u5173	m342	SUSIE	It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
L199208	u5164	m342	JACK	Hey, business is business.
L199207	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
L199138	u5164	m342	JACK	No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
L199137	u5173	m342	SUSIE	If you want, I got a pack in the room.
L199136	u5173	m342	SUSIE	In and out.
L199135	u5164	m342	JACK	Like a baby. You?
L199134	u5173	m342	SUSIE	How's egghead?
L199133	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
L199132	u5173	m342	SUSIE	It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
L199131	u5164	m342	JACK	In and out.
L199130	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Can't sleep?
L199129	u5164	m342	JACK	It's okay.  Last one.
L199128	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
L198954	u5164	m342	JACK	I guess in case one year they're not.
L198953	u5173	m342	SUSIE	So why's he do it?
L198952	u5164	m342	JACK	Every year.
L198951	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Aren't the kids asleep?
L198950	u5164	m342	JACK	Every year.
L198949	u5173	m342	SUSIE	He do that every year?
L198915	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Nothing personal --
L198914	u5164	m342	JACK	Forget it.
L198913	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
L198912	u5164	m342	JACK	Forget it.
L198911	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
L198910	u5173	m342	SUSIE	No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
L198909	u5164	m342	JACK	You want me to walk you?
L198908	u5173	m342	SUSIE	You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
L198907	u5164	m342	JACK	Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
L198906	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
L198905	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
L198904	u5164	m342	JACK	Huh?
L198903	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
L198902	u5164	m342	JACK	The Stratford.
L198901	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
L198900	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
L198899	u5164	m342	JACK	He takes after our mother.
L198898	u5173	m342	SUSIE	I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
L198897	u5164	m342	JACK	His kid's sick.
L198896	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Where's egghead?
L198871	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
L198870	u5164	m342	JACK	Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
L198869	u5173	m342	SUSIE	The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
L198816	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
L198815	u5164	m342	JACK	Fucking.
L198678	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Not for money. With my mother.
L198677	u5164	m342	JACK	You never sang before?
L198676	u5164	m342	JACK	He'll come around.
L198675	u5173	m342	SUSIE	Hey, he's not sore, is he?
L198267	u5174	m342	TOMMY	He's got blood in his eye.
L198266	u5164	m342	JACK	It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
L198265	u5174	m342	TOMMY	Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
L198264	u5164	m342	JACK	Another five years, huh?
L198263	u5174	m342	TOMMY	Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
L198262	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
L198261	u5174	m342	TOMMY	No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
L198260	u5164	m342	JACK	Losing his teeth.
L198259	u5174	m342	TOMMY	Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
L198973	u5172	m342	NINA	That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
L198972	u5164	m342	JACK	Sure.
L198971	u5172	m342	NINA	There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
L198967	u5164	m342	JACK	Merry Christmas.
L198966	u5172	m342	NINA	Merry Christmas, Jack.
L198964	u5172	m342	NINA	Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
L198963	u5164	m342	JACK	Yeah?
L198962	u5172	m342	NINA	Jack.
L198961	u5164	m342	JACK	Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
L198960	u5172	m342	NINA	From Hurley's?
L198958	u5172	m342	NINA	Not so good.
L198957	u5164	m342	JACK	Okay.  How'd yours go?
L198956	u5172	m342	NINA	How'd the show go?
L198933	u5164	m342	JACK	He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
L198932	u5172	m342	NINA	I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
L198702	u5164	m342	JACK	Ever go to church?
L198701	u5172	m342	NINA	What's a prom?
L198700	u5164	m342	JACK	Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
L198699	u5172	m342	NINA	Why not?
L198698	u5164	m342	JACK	Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
L198697	u5172	m342	NINA	Wow.
L198696	u5164	m342	JACK	Older than me.
L198695	u5172	m342	NINA	Looks old.
L198694	u5164	m342	JACK	Ivory.
L198693	u5172	m342	NINA	I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
L198692	u5164	m342	JACK	Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
L198691	u5172	m342	NINA	I guess it's getting serious.
L198690	u5164	m342	JACK	Oh?
L198689	u5172	m342	NINA	I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
L198688	u5164	m342	JACK	How do you know?
L198687	u5172	m342	NINA	Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
L198686	u5164	m342	JACK	The recent past.
L198685	u5172	m342	NINA	What are they?
L198684	u5164	m342	JACK	My days are not the old days, genius.
L198683	u5172	m342	NINA	Is that what you used to do?
L198682	u5164	m342	JACK	In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
L198450	u5172	m342	NINA	Married.
L198449	u5164	m342	JACK	What happened to the donut king?
L198448	u5172	m342	NINA	Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
L198447	u5164	m342	JACK	Sounds big.  What's he do?
L198446	u5172	m342	NINA	Guess they're up.
L198444	u5164	m342	JACK	Eddie did.
L198443	u5172	m342	NINA	Did you break a cup, Jack?
L198420	u5164	m342	JACK	He's losing his teeth.
L198419	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
L198418	u5164	m342	JACK	Eddie.
L198417	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
L198416	u5164	m342	JACK	I'm not much for sweets.
L198415	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	None?
L198414	u5164	m342	JACK	Huh? Oh, no.
L198413	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Big piece or little?
L198412	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	Oh, fine.
L198411	u5164	m342	JACK	Fine.  You?
L198410	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	So. How are you?
L198398	u5164	m342	JACK	Good to see you, Ma.
L198397	u5170	m342	MRS. BAKER	John.  It's good to see you.
L220481	u5364	m356	FORD	I ain't -- got -- you.
L220480	u5361	m356	BAND	I said, I ain't got you...
L220479	u5364	m356	FORD	I said, I ain't got you...
L220478	u5361	m356	BAND	No, I ain't got you...
L220477	u5364	m356	FORD	No, I ain't got you...
L220476	u5361	m356	BAND	But I ain't got you...
L220475	u5364	m356	FORD	But I ain't got you...
L220664	u5364	m356	FORD	Thanks, I needed that.
L220663	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Art Mo-o-o-ney!
L220661	u5364	m356	FORD	What did these Vancouver factories do?
L220660	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	That was close...
L220658	u5364	m356	FORD	Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
L220657	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
L220656	u5364	m356	FORD	What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
L220655	u5364	m356	FORD	But I am...
L220654	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
L220652	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
L220651	u5364	m356	FORD	Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
L220650	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Did she tell you anything?
L220649	u5364	m356	FORD	Have what?
L220648	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
L220647	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
L220646	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
L220531	u5364	m356	FORD	Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
L220530	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
L220529	u5364	m356	FORD	Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
L220528	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I'll do my best.
L220527	u5364	m356	FORD	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
L220526	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
L220525	u5364	m356	FORD	Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
L220524	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	So you...
L220523	u5364	m356	FORD	Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
L220520	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
L220519	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
L220510	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Uh, let's go sit down.
L220509	u5364	m356	FORD	Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
L220508	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
L220442	u5364	m356	FORD	Nuthin'.
L220441	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Who?
L220440	u5364	m356	FORD	Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
L220439	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
L220438	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh... I have some questions.
L220437	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Actually, you may take it all now.
L220436	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
L220435	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
L220434	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
L220433	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Excuse me?
L220432	u5364	m356	FORD	No thanks.  I carry my own.
L220431	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
L220430	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
L220429	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
L220428	u5364	m356	FORD	Now that we've broken the ice...
L220427	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
L220426	u5364	m356	FORD	Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
L220425	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
L220424	u5364	m356	FORD	Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
L220423	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Who's your decorator?
L220422	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
L220421	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't know, I never met your father.
L220420	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
L220419	u5364	m356	FORD	Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
L220418	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Please.
L220417	u5364	m356	FORD	Don't say it.  Orange juice?
L220416	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
L220922	u5364	m356	FORD	No prob...
L220921	u5363	m356	DON	Thanks for the promotion, man.
L220881	u5363	m356	DON	Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
L220880	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
L220484	u5363	m356	DON	Right away!
L220483	u5364	m356	FORD	Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
L220463	u5364	m356	FORD	I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
L220462	u5363	m356	DON	Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
L220452	u5363	m356	DON	Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
L220451	u5364	m356	FORD	I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
L220450	u5364	m356	FORD	Great pipes.
L220449	u5363	m356	DON	I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
L220270	u5364	m356	FORD	I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
L220269	u5363	m356	DON	You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
L220258	u5363	m356	DON	Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
L220257	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
L220256	u5363	m356	DON	Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
L220255	u5364	m356	FORD	So many assholes, so few bullets.
L220955	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Wha --
L220954	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
L220953	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
L220875	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
L220874	u5364	m356	FORD	After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
L220869	u5366	m356	JAZZ	But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
L220868	u5364	m356	FORD	Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
L220867	u5366	m356	JAZZ	C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
L220866	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
L220865	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
L220864	u5364	m356	FORD	What an interface!
L220855	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Johnny's C.D.?
L220854	u5364	m356	FORD	Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
L220757	u5364	m356	FORD	Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
L220756	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
L220751	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're not funny.
L220750	u5364	m356	FORD	Aha, just what I suspected!
L220748	u5364	m356	FORD	I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
L220747	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
L220743	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
L220742	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I came to warn you...
L220721	u5364	m356	FORD	What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
L220720	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Hello, Ford...
L220678	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
L220677	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Ah, an obvious choice.
L220676	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Who?
L220675	u5364	m356	FORD	Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
L220674	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You okay?
L220645	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
L220644	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, let's bury her.
L220643	u5366	m356	JAZZ	She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
L220638	u5364	m356	FORD	Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
L220637	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
L220636	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't know, what was the case?
L220633	u5364	m356	FORD	I like.
L220632	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Contacts.
L220631	u5364	m356	FORD	What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
L220562	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
L220561	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
L220560	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Make eye contact when you say that.
L220559	u5364	m356	FORD	I wish I knew.  You did good work...
L220558	u5366	m356	JAZZ	No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
L220557	u5364	m356	FORD	A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
L220556	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
L220555	u5364	m356	FORD	How'd you get this from her?
L220554	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
L220553	u5364	m356	FORD	Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
L220544	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
L220543	u5364	m356	FORD	And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
L220518	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Go on, 'they're stahting.'
L220517	u5364	m356	FORD	You going to be okay?
L220515	u5364	m356	FORD	This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
L220514	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
L220513	u5364	m356	FORD	Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
L220448	u5364	m356	FORD	Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
L220447	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Spooky.  I'll process her.
L220446	u5364	m356	FORD	Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
L220445	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
L220444	u5364	m356	FORD	Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
L220344	u5364	m356	FORD	Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
L220343	u5366	m356	JAZZ	So what about this watch?
L220342	u5364	m356	FORD	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
L220341	u5366	m356	JAZZ	That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
L220338	u5364	m356	FORD	I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
L220337	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
L220331	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
L220330	u5364	m356	FORD	Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
L220329	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're saying you need money.
L220328	u5364	m356	FORD	Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
L220327	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
L220326	u5364	m356	FORD	Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
L220325	u5366	m356	JAZZ	G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
L220324	u5366	m356	JAZZ	'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
L220323	u5364	m356	FORD	I do it for love.
L220306	u5364	m356	FORD	Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
L220305	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You wish.
L220302	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Exactly.
L220301	u5364	m356	FORD	All your friends call you Jazz.
L220300	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
L220299	u5364	m356	FORD	Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
L220574	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
L220573	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Hey, they blew me.
L220572	u5364	m356	FORD	You gave it to the girls for one.
L220571	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Three hundred.
L220570	u5364	m356	FORD	How much?
L220569	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
L220568	u5364	m356	FORD	Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
L220567	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Got those Vomit invites here...
L220925	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
L220924	u5364	m356	FORD	So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
L220911	u5364	m356	FORD	Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
L220910	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
L220883	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll mail you a letter, come on!
L220882	u5373	m356	ZUZU	You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
L220861	u5364	m356	FORD	ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
L220860	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
L220852	u5373	m356	ZUZU	There's that question...
L220851	u5364	m356	FORD	Are you okay?
L220846	u5364	m356	FORD	You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
L220845	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
L220840	u5364	m356	FORD	This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
L220839	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
L220838	u5364	m356	FORD	I can't kill this kid's father...
L220837	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
L220836	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
L220829	u5364	m356	FORD	I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
L220828	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Ick.
L220821	u5364	m356	FORD	Why have you come to my planet?
L220820	u5373	m356	ZUZU	"Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see ""Batman,"" you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny."
L220819	u5364	m356	FORD	Pretty smooth, huh?
L220816	u5364	m356	FORD	Ye-ah.
L220815	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
L220814	u5364	m356	FORD	As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
L220813	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Suck a dick, I left my purse...
L220812	u5364	m356	FORD	No, wait...
L220811	u5373	m356	ZUZU	This way...
L220810	u5364	m356	FORD	Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
L220809	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Nice left you got there, jerk.
L220793	u5373	m356	ZUZU	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
L220792	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm afraid so, you want her?
L220769	u5364	m356	FORD	Ye-ah.
L220768	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Ford, you were right!
L220753	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
L220752	u5373	m356	ZUZU	This is boring, guys.
L220718	u5364	m356	FORD	Ye-ah.  Sure.
L220717	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
L220692	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
L220691	u5364	m356	FORD	My axe!
L220689	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
L220688	u5364	m356	FORD	Are you okay?
L220687	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hah fluck, great video, huh?
L220686	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu, wake up...
L220684	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Who cares about people?
L220683	u5364	m356	FORD	People still watch that?
L220682	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
L220681	u5373	m356	ZUZU	What a perv...
L220680	u5364	m356	FORD	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
L220679	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
L220641	u5373	m356	ZUZU	You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
L220640	u5364	m356	FORD	Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
L220639	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
L220629	u5364	m356	FORD	He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
L220628	u5373	m356	ZUZU	No.  Who's Art Mooney?
L220627	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
L220626	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
L220625	u5364	m356	FORD	You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
L220624	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Because I know rock-n-roll.
L220623	u5364	m356	FORD	How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
L220622	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Spunk, come back...
L220621	u5373	m356	ZUZU	It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
L220620	u5364	m356	FORD	What?  Jesus, tell me!
L220619	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
L220618	u5364	m356	FORD	You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
L220617	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
L220616	u5364	m356	FORD	Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
L220615	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Why are all these people after me?
L220614	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's get serious...
L220610	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Peachy.
L220609	u5364	m356	FORD	You okay?
L220608	u5364	m356	FORD	Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
L220607	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hello?
L220606	u5364	m356	FORD	What?
L220605	u5373	m356	ZUZU	It's red, Ford.
L220582	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Fluck you!
L220581	u5364	m356	FORD	A simple 'please' would suffice...
L220580	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
L220579	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
L220952	u5372	m356	THE KID	Shut the heck up... Pop.
L220951	u5364	m356	FORD	I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
L220950	u5364	m356	FORD	He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
L220949	u5372	m356	THE KID	Who's my real father, man?
L220948	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
L220947	u5372	m356	THE KID	What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
L220946	u5364	m356	FORD	It's me.
L220945	u5364	m356	FORD	Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
L220944	u5372	m356	THE KID	Yeah, go on...
L220943	u5364	m356	FORD	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
L220942	u5372	m356	THE KID	So, did you find my dad?
L220708	u5372	m356	THE KID	Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
L220707	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
L220706	u5372	m356	THE KID	Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
L220705	u5364	m356	FORD	And hey, I appreciate it...
L220704	u5372	m356	THE KID	I tried to help you...!
L220703	u5364	m356	FORD	Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
L220702	u5372	m356	THE KID	Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
L220701	u5364	m356	FORD	Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
L220700	u5372	m356	THE KID	These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
L220699	u5364	m356	FORD	Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
L220698	u5372	m356	THE KID	I'm sorry...
L220414	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't need it that bad.
L220413	u5372	m356	THE KID	You need it.
L220412	u5364	m356	FORD	Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
L220411	u5372	m356	THE KID	I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
L220410	u5364	m356	FORD	Did he just say what I think he said?
L220409	u5372	m356	THE KID	This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
L220408	u5364	m356	FORD	Twelve pack?
L220407	u5372	m356	THE KID	Who cares?  I got a case.
L220406	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
L220405	u5372	m356	THE KID	Ouch.
L220296	u5372	m356	THE KID	Forget it.
L220295	u5364	m356	FORD	Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
L220294	u5372	m356	THE KID	I got something serious to dis-cuss.
L220293	u5364	m356	FORD	Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
L220292	u5372	m356	THE KID	When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
L220289	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
L220288	u5372	m356	THE KID	Gut feeling.
L220287	u5364	m356	FORD	Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
L220286	u5372	m356	THE KID	Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
L220672	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
L220671	u5364	m356	FORD	Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
L220670	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
L220669	u5364	m356	FORD	Really?
L220668	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
L220667	u5364	m356	FORD	That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
L220666	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
L220404	u5364	m356	FORD	You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
L220403	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
L220402	u5364	m356	FORD	I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
L220401	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Like me.
L220400	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
L220399	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	'Booty Time.'
L220398	u5364	m356	FORD	Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
L220397	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Two words.  Disco Express.
L220396	u5364	m356	FORD	Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
L220395	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
L220394	u5364	m356	FORD	Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
L220393	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	What are you running from?
L220391	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
L220390	u5364	m356	FORD	You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
L220389	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
L220388	u5364	m356	FORD	Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
L220940	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Anyway you want it, asshole.
L220939	u5364	m356	FORD	Let me go out like a man.
L220938	u5371	m356	SMILEY	The point?
L220937	u5364	m356	FORD	You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
L220936	u5371	m356	SMILEY	How's it going?
L220835	u5364	m356	FORD	Okay.  'B-y-e!
L220834	u5371	m356	SMILEY	<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
L220833	u5364	m356	FORD	I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
L220595	u5364	m356	FORD	Say cheese...
L220594	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
L220593	u5364	m356	FORD	You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
L220507	u5364	m356	FORD	<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
L220506	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
L220505	u5364	m356	FORD	The case!
L220504	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Off what?  Twenty seconds...
L220503	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm off it!
L220502	u5371	m356	SMILEY	What's fine?
L220501	u5364	m356	FORD	Fine!
L220500	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
L220499	u5364	m356	FORD	I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
L220498	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
L220496	u5364	m356	FORD	Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
L220495	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Polo.
L220917	u5364	m356	FORD	Julian, you're fired.
L220916	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	I'm still the king!
L220909	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
L220908	u5364	m356	FORD	Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
L220903	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
L220902	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
L220901	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
L220900	u5364	m356	FORD	Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
L220899	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Fuck me...
L220898	u5364	m356	FORD	And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
L220897	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
L220896	u5364	m356	FORD	You'd said something about proof...
L220804	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Ciao.
L220803	u5364	m356	FORD	Shit.
L220802	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
L220801	u5364	m356	FORD	When I say 'no,' run for the door.
L220799	u5364	m356	FORD	Are you okay?
L220798	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Kill them.  Not quickly.
L220788	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
L220787	u5364	m356	FORD	What about Don?
L220786	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
L220785	u5364	m356	FORD	I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
L220783	u5364	m356	FORD	Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
L220782	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
L220781	u5364	m356	FORD	<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
L220777	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
L220776	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	It doesn't have to be like this?
L220772	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
L220771	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
L220770	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
L220765	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Golly, I'd probably faint.
L220764	u5364	m356	FORD	And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
L220763	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Shock.
L220762	u5364	m356	FORD	Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
L220552	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Go on, another time, another place.
L220551	u5364	m356	FORD	Jazz, we're talking here.
L220547	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
L220546	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
L220545	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
L220542	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
L220541	u5364	m356	FORD	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
L220540	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Well, hello, Ford.
L220465	u5364	m356	FORD	I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
L220464	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
L220461	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
L220460	u5364	m356	FORD	I knew your father.  He was quite...
L220459	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
L220458	u5364	m356	FORD	Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
L220457	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
L220456	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
L220455	u5364	m356	FORD	How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
L220746	u5364	m356	FORD	It is to us!  It's computerised.
L220745	u5369	m356	MELODI	This isn't music!
L220716	u5364	m356	FORD	Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
L220715	u5369	m356	MELODI	Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
L220713	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, the poet...
L220712	u5369	m356	MELODI	Hi, private eye guy!
L220267	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
L220266	u5369	m356	MELODI	You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
L220265	u5364	m356	FORD	That's funny, you're cute.
L220264	u5369	m356	MELODI	That's cute.  You're funny.
L220263	u5364	m356	FORD	Only on a first name basis.
L220262	u5369	m356	MELODI	Do you really know everybody in the industry?
L220261	u5364	m356	FORD	You're a poet and didn't know it.
L220260	u5369	m356	MELODI	You're that guy, the private eye.
L220367	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
L220366	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
L220365	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
L220364	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
L220363	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
L220362	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	So...
L220359	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	What?
L220358	u5364	m356	FORD	'Bye, Johnny...
L220357	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
L220356	u5364	m356	FORD	How nice.
L220355	u5364	m356	FORD	Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
L220354	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
L220353	u5364	m356	FORD	Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
L220352	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
L220351	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
L325691	u6118	m406	JACK	Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
L325690	u6119	m406	MOTHER	Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
L325689	u6118	m406	JACK	Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
L325688	u6119	m406	MOTHER	Yeah?
L325687	u6118	m406	JACK	What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
L325686	u6119	m406	MOTHER	No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
L325685	u6118	m406	JACK	Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
L325684	u6119	m406	MOTHER	Oh no--
L325683	u6118	m406	JACK	You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
L325682	u6119	m406	MOTHER	What?
L325681	u6118	m406	JACK	I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
L325680	u6119	m406	MOTHER	Yes.
L325679	u6118	m406	JACK	Did you like that, Mama?
L407531	u6798	m453	STAR	Come on.
L407530	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	I won first prize.
L407529	u6798	m453	STAR	Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
L407528	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Hi! Star.
L407527	u6798	m453	STAR	Winifred.
L406874	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	I know that, Star.
L406873	u6798	m453	STAR	I hate that music.
L406872	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Grand Old Opera --
L406871	u6798	m453	STAR	What?
L406870	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
L406869	u6798	m453	STAR	Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
L406868	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	What do you have to buy?
L406867	u6798	m453	STAR	I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
L406866	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	You got a real good memory, Star.
L406865	u6798	m453	STAR	You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
L406864	u6798	m453	STAR	Well, it better not happen again.
L406863	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Well, that just happened that time.
L406862	u6798	m453	STAR	Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
L406861	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Right here.
L406860	u6798	m453	STAR	You got the money?
L407252	u6789	m453	LINNEA	No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
L407251	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
L407250	u6789	m453	LINNEA	No.
L407249	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Is there food?
L407248	u6789	m453	LINNEA	We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
L407247	u6780	m453	ALBUQUERQUE	Yes. I'm cutting a record.
L407246	u6789	m453	LINNEA	You're from out of town?
L407493	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	You're so good.
L407492	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Don't worry, I'll take care or it
L407491	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	All those people...
L407490	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
L407489	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
L407104	u6782	m453	BARNETT	What?
L407103	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	Barnett?
L407093	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
L407092	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	You have to what?
L407091	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
L407090	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	Then why are you listening to her -
L407089	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Don't feel that way, honey.
L407088	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	I don't want to listen to her sing -
L407087	u6782	m453	BARNETT	What's wrong honey.
L407086	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	Barnett, please -
L407028	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	I see.
L407027	u6782	m453	BARNETT	I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
L407373	u6785	m453	GREEN	Bye, Bye.
L407372	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
L407371	u6785	m453	GREEN	I got them right here.
L407370	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	You get her those Vitamin E right away.
L407369	u6785	m453	GREEN	I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
L407368	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	Thank you-- Yes, I am.
L407367	u6785	m453	GREEN	You going today?
L407128	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
L407127	u6785	m453	GREEN	I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
L407126	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
L407122	u6785	m453	GREEN	Green.
L407121	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	What did you say your name was?
L407120	u6785	m453	GREEN	Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
L407119	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	What's wrong with her.
L407118	u6785	m453	GREEN	Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
L407117	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	I said, I've been real tired.
L407116	u6785	m453	GREEN	You'll have to speak up.
L407115	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
L407113	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	How did you come in here?
L407112	u6785	m453	GREEN	Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
L407110	u6781	m453	BARBARA JEAN	I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
L407109	u6785	m453	GREEN	Am I disturbing you?
L407507	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Your job, huh.
L407506	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
L407505	u6782	m453	BARNETT	No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
L407504	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
L407503	u6782	m453	BARNETT	I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
L407500	u6782	m453	BARNETT	I said 'no!'
L407499	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	They can come to the concert in the park.
L407498	u6782	m453	BARNETT	What?
L407485	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
L407484	u6782	m453	BARNETT	His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
L407483	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	His Word.
L407482	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Whose word?
L407481	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
L407480	u6782	m453	BARNETT	How is that?
L407479	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Well, it's probably because it would help him.
L407478	u6782	m453	BARNETT	He knows better.
L407477	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
L407476	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
L407475	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
L407338	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
L407337	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Well, I just thought I'd call.
L407336	u6782	m453	BARNETT	She's fine.
L407335	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
L407334	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Yes.
L406902	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Okay. Thanks.
L406901	u6782	m453	BARNETT	You bet.
L406900	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
L406899	u6782	m453	BARNETT	What do you really want?
L406898	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Oh, sure.
L406897	u6782	m453	BARNETT	I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
L406896	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
L406895	u6782	m453	BARNETT	She's going to rest now.
L406894	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
L407365	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Okay.
L407364	u6797	m453	REESE	Okay, then we'll see you there.
L407363	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Yes. She's pretty rested up.
L407362	u6797	m453	REESE	Well, how about the shopping center?
L407361	u6782	m453	BARNETT	I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
L407360	u6797	m453	REESE	It's on National television, Barnett.
L407359	u6782	m453	BARNETT	You know better than that.
L407358	u6797	m453	REESE	That's what he wants.
L407357	u6782	m453	BARNETT	What!
L407356	u6797	m453	REESE	Barbara Jean.
L407355	u6782	m453	BARNETT	What does he want?
L407354	u6797	m453	REESE	He has that sign with the tree.
L407353	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Third party?
L407352	u6797	m453	REESE	He's going to run for president.
L407351	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Who the hell is he?
L407350	u6797	m453	REESE	He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
L407349	u6782	m453	BARNETT	Who the hell is he?
L407348	u6797	m453	REESE	Have you talked to Triplette?
L407347	u6782	m453	BARNETT	A little slow, but she'll be fine.
L407346	u6797	m453	REESE	How is she?
L407197	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Okay.
L407196	u6783	m453	BILL	Okay.
L407188	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Sure thing.
L407187	u6783	m453	BILL	D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
L407186	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	D.C.
L407185	u6783	m453	BILL	Where'd he ever see us?
L407174	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Minimum.
L407173	u6783	m453	BILL	How much?
L407172	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	ABC.
L407171	u6783	m453	BILL	National television?
L407164	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	President.
L407163	u6783	m453	BILL	What's he running for?
L407158	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Hal Phillip Walker.
L407157	u6783	m453	BILL	Whose?
L407156	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
L407155	u6783	m453	BILL	Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
L407154	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
L407153	u6783	m453	BILL	You want anything?  A drink?
L407149	u6783	m453	BILL	Hi. Come on in. Mary!
L407148	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Hi. I'm John Triplette.
L407454	u6792	m453	MARY	Sue was trying to get hold of you.
L407453	u6783	m453	BILL	Yes, but we're just singing.
L407182	u6783	m453	BILL	How come?
L407181	u6792	m453	MARY	You're kidding.
L407177	u6792	m453	MARY	Bill, he's a crazy man.
L407176	u6783	m453	BILL	It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
L407166	u6783	m453	BILL	When is it?
L407165	u6792	m453	MARY	President?
L407142	u6792	m453	MARY	Stop it!
L407141	u6783	m453	BILL	Bastard
L407464	u6800	m453	TOM	The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
L407463	u6783	m453	BILL	He saw us at Tammany Hall.
L407456	u6783	m453	BILL	What crook?
L407455	u6800	m453	TOM	Come on. He's a crook.
L407450	u6783	m453	BILL	Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
L407449	u6800	m453	TOM	National?
L407448	u6783	m453	BILL	Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
L407327	u6800	m453	TOM	It's the den mother.
L407326	u6783	m453	BILL	Hey!
L407322	u6800	m453	TOM	To the bathroom.
L407321	u6783	m453	BILL	Where are you going?
L407319	u6783	m453	BILL	Where the hell have you been?
L407318	u6800	m453	TOM	Howdy.
L407054	u6797	m453	REESE	I'll just be in here.
L407053	u6784	m453	BUD	You bet.
L407052	u6797	m453	REESE	Let me know when you do, all right?
L407051	u6784	m453	BUD	Not yet.
L407050	u6797	m453	REESE	Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
L407049	u6784	m453	BUD	She's in Paris.
L407048	u6797	m453	REESE	Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
L407047	u6784	m453	BUD	Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
L407046	u6797	m453	REESE	Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
L407045	u6784	m453	BUD	Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
L407044	u6797	m453	REESE	Sorry to bother you, Bud.
L407058	u6784	m453	BUD	Sure he will.
L407057	u6796	m453	OPAL	Haven's not going to talk to me.
L407056	u6784	m453	BUD	Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
L407055	u6796	m453	OPAL	Do you know Barbara Jean?
L407043	u6784	m453	BUD	Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
L407042	u6796	m453	OPAL	How in the world did he get shot?
L407041	u6784	m453	BUD	You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
L407040	u6796	m453	OPAL	What is a turkey shoot.
L407039	u6784	m453	BUD	Business School so I can run Haven's business.
L407038	u6796	m453	OPAL	Harvard?
L407037	u6784	m453	BUD	Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
L407036	u6796	m453	OPAL	Your brother?
L407035	u6784	m453	BUD	He got killed at a turkey shoot.
L406718	u6796	m453	OPAL	Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
L406717	u6784	m453	BUD	He's my father.
L407383	u6795	m453	NURSE	Your wire Ester - she passed away.
L407382	u6785	m453	GREEN	What?
L407381	u6795	m453	NURSE	No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
L407380	u6785	m453	GREEN	You want me to wait?
L407379	u6795	m453	NURSE	Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
L407378	u6785	m453	GREEN	I'm fine. Can I go up?
L407377	u6795	m453	NURSE	Didn't you get?... How are you?
L407376	u6785	m453	GREEN	Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
L407375	u6795	m453	NURSE	Mr. Green?
L407125	u6795	m453	NURSE	How'd you get in here.
L407124	u6785	m453	GREEN	Hi, Sherry.
L407123	u6795	m453	NURSE	Well, Mr. Green.
L407021	u6795	m453	NURSE	That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
L407020	u6785	m453	GREEN	Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
L407019	u6795	m453	NURSE	HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
L407561	u6785	m453	GREEN	Good night,
L407560	u6787	m453	KENNY	Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
L407559	u6785	m453	GREEN	Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
L407010	u6785	m453	GREEN	A little. What do you need?
L407009	u6787	m453	KENNY	Listen, do you know anything about cars?
L407008	u6787	m453	KENNY	Suits me.
L407007	u6785	m453	GREEN	Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
L407006	u6787	m453	KENNY	I'm not really a musician.
L407005	u6785	m453	GREEN	When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
L407004	u6787	m453	KENNY	Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
L407003	u6785	m453	GREEN	My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
L407002	u6787	m453	KENNY	She sure sings nice.
L407001	u6785	m453	GREEN	I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
L406997	u6785	m453	GREEN	I think we can do that. Come in.
L406996	u6787	m453	KENNY	Yes, sir. I need a room
L406995	u6785	m453	GREEN	Can I help you?
L406994	u6787	m453	KENNY	Yes, sir.
L406775	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	That Tom sure is cute.
L406774	u6785	m453	GREEN	Maybe you can look after me a little.
L406773	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
L406772	u6785	m453	GREEN	I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
L406771	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
L406770	u6785	m453	GREEN	What did you say?
L406769	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
L406768	u6785	m453	GREEN	Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
L406767	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
L406766	u6785	m453	GREEN	It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
L406765	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	You know anything about the stations here?
L406764	u6785	m453	GREEN	She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
L406763	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	Uh huh.
L406734	u6785	m453	GREEN	I'1l get your bag.
L406733	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	He is just wonderful.
L406732	u6785	m453	GREEN	Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
L406731	u6788	m453	L.A. JOAN	Did you see who that was?
L407315	u6786	m453	JOAN	I don't really know what you're talking about.
L407314	u6787	m453	KENNY	I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
L407313	u6786	m453	JOAN	I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
L407312	u6787	m453	KENNY	Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
L407288	u6786	m453	JOAN	I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
L407287	u6787	m453	KENNY	Well, he's really amazing.
L407286	u6786	m453	JOAN	You must really like him.
L407285	u6787	m453	KENNY	Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
L407284	u6786	m453	JOAN	How do you know?
L407283	u6787	m453	KENNY	A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
L407282	u6786	m453	JOAN	Who's that?
L407281	u6787	m453	KENNY	Replacement party.
L407280	u6786	m453	JOAN	What's this?
L406971	u6798	m453	STAR	Get in.

L407230	u6787	m453	KENNY	How do you know if they do?
L407229	u6793	m453	MOTHER	Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
L407228	u6787	m453	KENNY	I don't think so.
L407227	u6793	m453	MOTHER	He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
L407226	u6787	m453	KENNY	Fungus?
L407225	u6793	m453	MOTHER	Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
L407224	u6787	m453	KENNY	No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
L407223	u6793	m453	MOTHER	Bet the sheets are grey.
L407222	u6787	m453	KENNY	I don't know his first name.
L407221	u6793	m453	MOTHER	Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
L407220	u6787	m453	KENNY	I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
L407219	u6793	m453	MOTHER	How are you going to pay when you get sick?
L407218	u6787	m453	KENNY	I feel really good.
L407217	u6793	m453	MOTHER	Next you'll be sick.
L407216	u6787	m453	KENNY	Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
L407215	u6793	m453	MOTHER	Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
L407214	u6787	m453	KENNY	The car broke down.
L407213	u6793	m453	MOTHER	Oh... Well.
L407212	u6787	m453	KENNY	Nashville.
L407211	u6793	m453	MOTHER	I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
L407210	u6787	m453	KENNY	Mom?
L406859	u6789	m453	LINNEA	He's a member of our congregation.
L406858	u6796	m453	OPAL	Do you like him?
L406857	u6789	m453	LINNEA	No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
L406856	u6796	m453	OPAL	Are you a close friend of Haven's?
L406855	u6789	m453	LINNEA	No, I don't.
L406854	u6796	m453	OPAL	Do you ever do any writing?
L406853	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
L406852	u6796	m453	OPAL	And before?
L406851	u6789	m453	LINNEA	About three years.
L406850	u6796	m453	OPAL	How long have you been with them?
L406849	u6789	m453	LINNEA	It just is.
L406848	u6796	m453	OPAL	Well, can you tell me why?
L406847	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Yes, it is --
L406846	u6796	m453	OPAL	Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
L406845	u6789	m453	LINNEA	When I was little, in church.
L406844	u6796	m453	OPAL	When did you start singing?
L406843	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
L406842	u6796	m453	OPAL	Have your children been deaf since birth?
L407557	u6800	m453	TOM	I know. Goodbye.
L407556	u6789	m453	LINNEA	That's what you said before.
L407555	u6800	m453	TOM	I'll talk to you tomorrow.
L407553	u6800	m453	TOM	Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
L407552	u6789	m453	LINNEA	That's unkind.
L407551	u6800	m453	TOM	Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
L407550	u6800	m453	TOM	Older than thirty?
L407549	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Oh.
L407548	u6800	m453	TOM	I'm twenty-eight
L407547	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Well...

L407543	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Oh.
L407542	u6800	m453	TOM	I knew when I first met you.
L407541	u6789	m453	LINNEA	I'm not sure.
L407540	u6800	m453	TOM	When did you think it would happen?
L407539	u6800	m453	TOM	Car pool?
L407538	u6789	m453	LINNEA	I can't.

L407536	u6800	m453	TOM	I know.
L407535	u6789	m453	LINNEA	I have to go. He sighs.
L407534	u6800	m453	TOM	Wrong.
L407533	u6789	m453	LINNEA	I have to go.
L407532	u6800	m453	TOM	You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
L407399	u6800	m453	TOM	I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
L407398	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Doesn't it have a name?
L407397	u6800	m453	TOM	End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
L407396	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Oh?

L406953	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Well...How have you been?
L406952	u6800	m453	TOM	That's not quite what I had in mind.
L406951	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
L406950	u6800	m453	TOM	I'd really like to see you.
L406948	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?

L407436	u6789	m453	LINNEA	Fifteen minutes?
L407435	u6802	m453	WADE	All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
L407434	u6802	m453	WADE	High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?

L406978	u6800	m453	TOM	Just a minute.
L406977	u6796	m453	OPAL	Come on.
L406976	u6800	m453	TOM	Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
L406975	u6796	m453	OPAL	Come on back to bed.
L406918	u6800	m453	TOM	Depends on what I'm studying.
L406917	u6796	m453	OPAL	Do you study at all?
L406916	u6800	m453	TOM	Probably a little too long.
L406915	u6796	m453	OPAL	How long have you been together?
L406914	u6800	m453	TOM	Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
L406913	u6796	m453	OPAL	Did it break?
L406912	u6800	m453	TOM	No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
L406911	u6796	m453	OPAL	Do they have a show to give it to you?
L406910	u6800	m453	TOM	We just got a gold record.
L407068	u6796	m453	OPAL	What? Oh. A film.
L407067	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	What?
L407066	u6796	m453	OPAL	Why?
L407065	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Why?
L407064	u6796	m453	OPAL	The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
L407063	u6796	m453	OPAL	I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
L407062	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
L407061	u6796	m453	OPAL	I'm Opal.
L407060	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Hello.
L407059	u6796	m453	OPAL	Hi.
L406841	u6797	m453	REESE	I'll be dammed.
L406840	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
L406839	u6797	m453	REESE	I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
L406838	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
L406837	u6797	m453	REESE	You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
L406836	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Ryan O'Neal.
L406835	u6797	m453	REESE	I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
L406834	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Peter Finch -- he's English.
L406833	u6797	m453	REESE	Who?
L406832	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Ah... Peter Finch.
L406831	u6797	m453	REESE	No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
L406830	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	I know a couple.
L406829	u6797	m453	REESE	Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
L406828	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Spent time in Arizona. Why?
L406827	u6797	m453	REESE	You always live there?
L406826	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Southern California.
L406825	u6797	m453	REESE	Where are you from?
L406824	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
L406823	u6797	m453	REESE	He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
L406822	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	He is to a lot of people.
L406821	u6797	m453	REESE	He ain't really new.
L406820	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
L406819	u6797	m453	REESE	You do?
L406818	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Well, I really think he's got a chance.
L406817	u6797	m453	REESE	We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
L406816	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Oh --
L406815	u6797	m453	REESE	No, we never did that
L406814	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	You go to school together?
L406813	u6797	m453	REESE	Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
L406812	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	What do you think of him?
L406741	u6797	m453	REESE	Where is she?
L406740	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Pleasure
L406798	u6802	m453	WADE	Sure thing.
L406797	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	You think it will?
L406796	u6802	m453	WADE	Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
L406795	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
L406794	u6802	m453	WADE	You serious?
L406793	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
L406792	u6802	m453	WADE	You think I should take lessons?
L406791	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	It's not bad.
L406790	u6802	m453	WADE	Is that good?
L406789	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	You sure do it loud.
L406788	u6802	m453	WADE	You think I got any kind of a voice?
L406787	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
L406712	u6802	m453	WADE	Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
L406711	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	Got me an audition tonight.
L406710	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	You bet.
L406709	u6802	m453	WADE	You want a ride into town?
L407415	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
L407414	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
L407412	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
L407411	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	I see.
L407410	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
L407403	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	May I see your costume?
L407402	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	Oh, why thank you.
L407401	u6801	m453	TRIPLETTE	I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
L407400	u6799	m453	SUELEEN	Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
L508652	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really?
L508651	u7625	m516	BISHOP O'HARA	I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
L508650	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Perhaps.
L508649	u7625	m516	BISHOP O'HARA	I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
L508648	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Well... thank you.
L508647	u7625	m516	BISHOP O'HARA	I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
L508646	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Oh?
L508645	u7625	m516	BISHOP O'HARA	Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
L508352	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
L508351	u7626	m516	CHARLENE	What about crack?  You a user?
L508350	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
L508346	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
L508345	u7626	m516	CHARLENE	Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
L508339	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Well... yes.  Yes it is.
L508338	u7626	m516	CHARLENE	Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
L508337	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Really.
L509092	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
L509091	u7627	m516	CHOIR	SING!
L509090	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	And I'm tearful!
L509089	u7627	m516	CHOIR	SING!
L509088	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But I'm fearful!
L509087	u7627	m516	CHOIR	SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
L509086	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Were you tempted?
L509085	u7627	m516	CHOIR	SING!
L508735	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	HE'S SO FINE...
L508734	u7627	m516	CHOIR	Yes, Mary?
L508733	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	He's... dreamy.  He's...
L508633	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I think they hear you!
L508632	u7627	m516	CHOIR	LET THY SPIRIT
L508631	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You know what we're saying!
L508630	u7627	m516	CHOIR	LET THY SPIRIT
L508624	u7627	m516	CHOIR	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
L508623	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You know, I just might!
L508622	u7627	m516	CHOIR	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
L508621	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I think I hear it!
L508620	u7627	m516	CHOIR	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
L508619	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But how?
L508618	u7627	m516	CHOIR	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
L508617	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What you say?
L508616	u7627	m516	CHOIR	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
L508458	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You know it.
L508457	u7631	m516	LAWANDA	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
L508456	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	How are you doing.
L508360	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
L508359	u7631	m516	LAWANDA	What you do?
L508358	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
L508357	u7631	m516	LAWANDA	No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
L508356	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	And you listen to that?
L508355	u7631	m516	LAWANDA	Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
L508344	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Probation?
L508343	u7631	m516	LAWANDA	'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
L508342	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
L508341	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	"Well... because it's in the Bible. ""Thou shalt not...""  Thou shalt not."
L508340	u7631	m516	LAWANDA	How come?  Sister?
L508336	u7631	m516	LAWANDA	We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
L508335	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
L508989	u7630	m516	JOEY	That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
L508988	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508987	u7630	m516	JOEY	Okay, Christy -- strip.
L508877	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You can handle this.
L508876	u7630	m516	JOEY	What?
L508875	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
L508874	u7630	m516	JOEY	Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
L508047	u7630	m516	JOEY	With love.
L508046	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	His ashes?
L508044	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
L508043	u7630	m516	JOEY	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
L508042	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
L509055	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
L509054	u7641	m516	VINCE	I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
L509032	u7641	m516	VINCE	Joey -- do it.
L509031	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
L508940	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
L508939	u7641	m516	VINCE	She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
L508931	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
L508930	u7641	m516	VINCE	What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
L508929	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Good evening, Vincent.
L508928	u7641	m516	VINCE	Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
L508096	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
L508095	u7641	m516	VINCE	And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
L508094	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Sure.
L508093	u7641	m516	VINCE	Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
L508092	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Thanks.  A lot.
L508091	u7641	m516	VINCE	Yes?
L508090	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	No... it's fine.
L508017	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
L508016	u7641	m516	VINCE	Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
L508015	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You pig!
L508014	u7641	m516	VINCE	We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
L508013	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You bastard!
L508012	u7641	m516	VINCE	You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
L508011	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What? 
L508010	u7641	m516	VINCE	He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
L508009	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
L508008	u7641	m516	VINCE	For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
L508007	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You did what?
L508006	u7641	m516	VINCE	I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
L508005	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Today was the deadline, Vince.
L508004	u7641	m516	VINCE	How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
L508003	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Vince...
L508002	u7641	m516	VINCE	You are so damn sexy.
L508001	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
L508000	u7641	m516	VINCE	What did who say?
L507999	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
L508037	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
L508036	u7639	m516	RONELLES	D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
L508035	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	HE'S SO FINE.
L508034	u7639	m516	RONELLES	Yes, Betty?
L508033	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
L508032	u7639	m516	RONELLES	Oh my! 
L508031	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Look at that.  Get a gander.
L508030	u7639	m516	RONELLES	What is it, Betty?
L508029	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Oh my! 
L508028	u7639	m516	RONELLES	Oh-huh.
L508027	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	This prom is a real drag.
L508026	u7639	m516	RONELLES	Yes, Betty?
L508025	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Oh, girls.
L509084	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Were you wicked?
L509083	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
L509082	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Pay attention...
L509081	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
L509080	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What a shame!
L509079	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
L509078	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It's true -- I know her.
L509077	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
L508825	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
L508824	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Hurry, Sister!
L508739	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
L508738	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Jackpot!  Two buckets
L508728	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That man -- who is he?
L508727	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	What is it, Mary?
L508675	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
L508674	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
L508606	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Because we're
L508605	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
L508604	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
L508603	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	"All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, ""That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."""
L508602	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Am I?
L508601	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
L508600	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
L508599	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
L508598	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
L508597	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	I know.  It's ancient.
L508596	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That machine.
L508586	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
L508585	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Two days.  An hour or so.
L508575	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
L508574	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Chops?
L508573	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
L508555	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
L508554	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hold on.
L508527	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
L508526	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Is this... choir practice?
L508396	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I love my heddles.  Show me again.
L508395	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
L508394	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	You betcha.
L508393	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Just about.  Show me again.
L508392	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
L508391	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
L508390	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
L508389	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
L508388	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
L508387	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Why?
L508386	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
L508385	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Not in years.
L508384	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
L508312	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
L508311	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
L508308	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
L508307	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Where did that come from?
L508292	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right.
L508291	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
L509098	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Sing!
L509097	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	JUST SING!
L509060	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	You re okay -- for a civilian.
L509059	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
L509040	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You know?  About me?  About everything?
L509039	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Van Cartier.
L508799	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
L508798	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
L508795	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
L508794	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Is there any syrup?
L508762	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508761	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	She's a pro.
L508670	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Again!
L508669	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Babies
L508668	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Amateurs 2
L508667	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hopeless I
L508666	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
L508665	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
L508594	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Tell me about it.
L508593	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It'll be hell.
L508591	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	A bunch of real mama's girls.
L508590	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Wet behind the ears.
L508589	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
L508584	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
L508583	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
L508582	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
L508581	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	I knew that.
L508580	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
L508564	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mary Robert.
L508563	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
L508553	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
L508552	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508551	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
L508550	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
L508547	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Um, I don't really know this one...
L508546	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Mary Clarence, are you with us?
L508531	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Whatever.
L508530	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Soprano or alto?
L508310	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You know that song?
L508309	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Shirelles.
L508300	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
L508299	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Like this place?
L508298	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
L508297	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508296	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Enough jabber.
L508295	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
L509076	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
L509075	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What did He say?
L509074	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
L509073	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Don't you know it!
L509072	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
L509071	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It's true!
L509070	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I WAS DOWNHEARTED
L509057	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Bless you.
L509056	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
L508873	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
L508872	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	But what do they want?  Where are we going?
L508870	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Again?
L508869	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Run!  Take off!
L508868	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	They're from my old convent.
L508867	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
L508816	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
L508815	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
L508801	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Oh no.  We'll always be together.
L508800	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Are you leaving us?
L508793	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
L508792	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
L508678	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	We're nuns!
L508677	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
L508662	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
L508661	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
L508568	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Give me a C.  A C!
L508567	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I don't want to mess anyone up...
L508566	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
L508565	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	What?
L508529	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
L508528	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
L508499	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
L508498	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
L508497	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
L508496	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Experience!
L508495	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Oh my Lord!
L508494	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
L508493	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Goddamn it!
L508491	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Keep moving!
L508490	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
L508488	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
L508487	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
L508486	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Honey.
L508485	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
L508484	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
L508483	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
L508480	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You watch yourself!
L508479	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I'm getting experience.
L508471	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
L508470	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Who are all these people?
L508468	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Really?
L508467	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
L508466	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
L508464	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right.
L508463	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Experience!  Right?
L508462	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Bobs
L508460	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
L508459	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	We need experience.
L508454	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Now you.
L508453	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
L508449	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Are you sure?
L508448	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
L508447	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
L508446	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
L508444	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
L508443	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	What?
L508442	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Well, then there's only one thing to do.
L508441	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	She said that?  Reverend Mother?
L508440	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
L508439	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	She won't?  Why not?
L508438	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
L508437	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Excuse me?
L508436	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
L508435	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
L508434	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	You have to help me
L508432	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
L508431	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	A novice.
L508430	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Three years.  A rookie.
L508429	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Three years.  Sister.
L508428	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
L508427	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
L508426	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
L508425	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
L508424	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
L508423	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	A cigarette?
L508422	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I... I brought you something.
L508421	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508420	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I... I...
L508419	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
L508290	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Five a.m.?
L508289	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	It's after five.  We have to bathe.
L508288	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?  What time is it?
L508287	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Come on, we're late.
L509069	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Don't push it.
L509068	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
L509067	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
L509066	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
L509065	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
L509064	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
L509050	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
L509049	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
L509044	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I'm a Christian.
L509043	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You saved my life.
L509042	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Oh?
L509041	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
L509007	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Saving you.  Move!
L509006	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What are you doing here?
L508787	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good day.
L508786	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But...
L508785	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
L508784	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
L508783	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
L508782	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
L508781	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
L508780	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
L508779	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
L508778	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I must go where I can be of use.
L508777	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But -- why?
L508776	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
L508775	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508774	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
L508773	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
L508765	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have a phone call.
L508764	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You sent for me?
L508758	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The majority has spoken.
L508757	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But... wait a minute...
L508756	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
L508755	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	A vote?
L508754	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
L508753	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
L508750	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
L508749	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What do you mean?
L508748	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
L508644	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
L508643	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
L508642	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Out of the question.
L508641	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
L508640	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
L508639	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
L508638	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
L508637	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
L508525	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
L508524	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
L508523	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You're my Olympic event.
L508522	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	No.  No.
L508521	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
L508520	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
L508519	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508518	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
L508517	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I am?
L508516	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
L508515	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
L508514	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
L508513	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
L508512	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
L508511	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
L508510	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
L508509	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
L508508	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
L508507	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	So... hi there.
L508403	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
L508402	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
L508401	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
L508400	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
L508399	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Really catching on.
L508376	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	"How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  ""No pain, no gain."""
L508375	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	In English?
L508374	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	"Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, ""Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."""
L508373	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It never solves anything.
L508372	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
L508371	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Sometimes it's not enough!
L508370	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
L508369	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
L508368	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
L508367	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
L508366	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
L508364	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence!
L508363	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
L508334	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Come, Sister.
L508333	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I got it.
L508332	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
L508331	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yeah?
L508283	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
L508282	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What's wrong with my life?
L508281	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
L508280	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
L508279	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
L508278	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
L508277	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cell is more than adequate.
L508276	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Oh, I don't know... Satan?
L508275	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And whom would you call?
L508274	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
L508273	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Useless distractions.
L508272	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
L508271	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
L508270	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
L508269	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cell.  Your room.
L508268	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	My what?
L508267	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
L508266	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
L508265	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes.  Until breakfast.
L508264	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Is this all the food I get?
L508255	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	No food.  Not until sundown.
L508254	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	No food?
L508253	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
L508252	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	A what?
L508251	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
L508248	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Until sundown.
L508247	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Silence?  No talking?  All day?
L508246	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
L508245	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	A what?
L508244	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
L508234	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I'm outta here.
L508233	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And the vow of chastity.
L508232	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Like to who?
L508231	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The vow of obedience.
L508230	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	No problem.
L508229	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
L508228	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
L508227	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
L508226	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
L508225	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
L508224	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	No!  No!  I can't do this!
L508223	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Can do.
L508222	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
L508220	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Would you like that?
L508219	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	"How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  ""Guest of St. Katherine's"""
L508218	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Deal.
L508217	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
L508216	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
L508215	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
L508214	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
L508213	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Check your driver's license.
L508212	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What's a concubine?
L508211	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
L508210	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You mean black people?
L508209	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And all those like you.
L508208	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Are you talking about me?
L508207	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
L508206	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508205	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	It has come to pass.
L508204	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cigarette -- out.
L508203	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What? 
L508202	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Miss Van Cartier.
L508200	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What?
L508199	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sit down.
L508198	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
L508197	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I see.
L508196	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
L508195	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The reason?
L508194	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
L508193	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You were unhappy?
L508192	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
L508191	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	St. Anne's?
L508190	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
L508189	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Very well.
L508188	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
L508187	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Enough joking.
L508186	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
L508185	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your name?
L508184	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
L508183	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
L508182	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
L509053	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yeah, like what?
L509052	u7629	m516	EDDIE	I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
L509051	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
L509046	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
L509045	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Don't you have a concert to go to?
L508852	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Even nuns have to pee.
L508851	u7629	m516	EDDIE	What're you doing?
L508844	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Nuns?
L508843	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	"You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... ""Star Search."" If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this."
L508842	u7629	m516	EDDIE	They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
L508841	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	That's not the point!  They need me!
L508840	u7629	m516	EDDIE	I think they'd understand.
L508839	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
L508833	u7629	m516	EDDIE	You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
L508832	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
L508831	u7629	m516	EDDIE	What?
L508830	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I can't go with you.
L508829	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
L508828	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	How?
L508827	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Vince knows you're here.
L508717	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
L508716	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
L508715	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I've got to go.
L508712	u7629	m516	EDDIE	You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
L508711	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I have?
L508710	u7629	m516	EDDIE	No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
L508709	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You're not... seeing anybody?
L508708	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Me too.
L508707	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
L508706	u7629	m516	EDDIE	No -- worried about you.  Personally.
L508705	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You mean -- worried about my testimony?
L508704	u7629	m516	EDDIE	I've been worried about you.
L508703	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Really?  Lieutenant?
L508702	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
L508701	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I am?
L508700	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
L508699	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
L508698	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
L508697	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
L508696	u7629	m516	EDDIE	You're supposed to be hiding out!
L508695	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
L508694	u7629	m516	EDDIE	What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
L508693	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
L508506	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
L508505	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
L508504	u7629	m516	EDDIE	She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
L508503	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
L508502	u7629	m516	EDDIE	You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
L508501	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What'd she say?
L508416	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
L508415	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
L508414	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
L508413	u7629	m516	EDDIE	I just need a few more weeks,
L508412	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	You son-of-a-bitch!
L508411	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
L508410	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Like what?
L508409	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
L508408	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
L508407	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
L508406	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
L508164	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Pray. 
L508163	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
L508162	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
L508161	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
L508160	u7629	m516	EDDIE	And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
L508157	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
L508156	u7629	m516	EDDIE	It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
L508155	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
L508154	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
L508153	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I hate you.  I totally hate you.
L508152	u7629	m516	EDDIE	I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
L508151	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
L508150	u7629	m516	EDDIE	No nothing.
L508149	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Okay -- no limo.
L508148	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
L508141	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Maybe Hawaii.
L508140	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
L508139	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Get a stenographer.
L508138	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
L508137	u7629	m516	EDDIE	You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
L508136	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Ten flights?
L508129	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Then-you run.
L508128	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	And if I don't?
L508118	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Screw you!
L508117	u7629	m516	EDDIE	He didn't do you a favor.
L508116	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
L508113	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
L508112	u7629	m516	EDDIE	You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
L508111	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
L508072	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Think again!  And get out of here.
L508071	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
L508070	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
L508069	u7629	m516	EDDIE	A what? When are you qonna wake up?
L508068	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	He's a businessman.
L508065	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
L508064	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
L508063	u7629	m516	EDDIE	So I don't shop.
L508062	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
L508061	u7629	m516	EDDIE	I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
L508060	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
L508059	u7629	m516	EDDIE	From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
L508726	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	But -- wait.
L508725	u7634	m516	MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Really.
L508724	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
L508723	u7634	m516	MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Oh-huh.
L508722	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
L508721	u7634	m516	MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Hail, Mary.
L508720	u7628	m516	CHRISTY	Hey, girls.
L508322	u7629	m516	EDDIE	I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
L508321	u7640	m516	TATE	You won't even tell us?
L508320	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Where's who?
L508319	u7640	m516	TATE	Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
L508318	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
L508133	u7640	m516	TATE	They open a window.
L508132	u7629	m516	EDDIE	Then one day they find you.
L508125	u7640	m516	TATE	A hiding place.
L508124	u7629	m516	EDDIE	We could put you into our witness protection program.
L508543	u7636	m516	MIKE	I'm telling you!
L508542	u7630	m516	JOEY	A nun?

L508537	u7630	m516	JOEY	We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
L508536	u7636	m516	MIKE	Who are you guys?
L508535	u7630	m516	JOEY	I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
L508533	u7636	m516	MIKE	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
L508532	u7630	m516	JOEY	We're looking for Mike.
L509034	u7641	m516	VINCE	She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
L509033	u7630	m516	JOEY	But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
L509030	u7630	m516	JOEY	Where is she?
L509029	u7641	m516	VINCE	Joey?
L509022	u7641	m516	VINCE	Willy -- hit the lights.
L509021	u7630	m516	JOEY	I can't see anything in here!
L509017	u7630	m516	JOEY	Which one?
L509016	u7641	m516	VINCE	There she is!
L509010	u7630	m516	JOEY	Which one!
L509009	u7641	m516	VINCE	Get her!
L508981	u7630	m516	JOEY	Maybe pants.
L508980	u7641	m516	VINCE	I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
L508977	u7641	m516	VINCE	So, take it off.
L508976	u7630	m516	JOEY	Right.
L508973	u7641	m516	VINCE	You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
L508972	u7630	m516	JOEY	It didn't work, Vince.
L508971	u7641	m516	VINCE	Well?
L508955	u7630	m516	JOEY	Yeah...
L508954	u7641	m516	VINCE	I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
L508951	u7641	m516	VINCE	It didn't happen.
L508950	u7630	m516	JOEY	But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
L508947	u7641	m516	VINCE	What's the problem?
L508946	u7630	m516	JOEY	Not... totally.
L508945	u7641	m516	VINCE	It's done?
L508261	u7641	m516	VINCE	You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
L508260	u7630	m516	JOEY	It's a bluff, Vince.
L508259	u7641	m516	VINCE	He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
L508105	u7641	m516	VINCE	Take care of it.
L508104	u7630	m516	JOEY	And if she runs?
L508101	u7641	m516	VINCE	Maybe. 
L508100	u7630	m516	JOEY	Vince -- is she... okay?
L508991	u7630	m516	JOEY	She's praying.
L508990	u7642	m516	WILLY	What's she doing?
L508983	u7630	m516	JOEY	And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
L508982	u7642	m516	WILLY	A sweater.
L508979	u7630	m516	JOEY	For like, twelve zillion eternities?
L508978	u7642	m516	WILLY	Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
L508964	u7642	m516	WILLY	That's what I figured, too.
L508963	u7630	m516	JOEY	I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
L508962	u7642	m516	WILLY	Neither did you!
L508961	u7630	m516	JOEY	You didn't shoot!
L508953	u7630	m516	JOEY	No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
L508952	u7642	m516	WILLY	She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
L508880	u7642	m516	WILLY	Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
L508879	u7630	m516	JOEY	She's gettin' away!
L508847	u7642	m516	WILLY	Yeah, right -- when I see it.
L508846	u7630	m516	JOEY	So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
L508898	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	We can't leave it up to the Feds!
L508897	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	We've got to save her!
L508892	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	That should have tipped us.
L508891	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
L508860	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	We're losing it.
L508859	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
L508818	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
L508817	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	It should be here any minute.
L508683	u7632	m516	MARY LAZARUS	Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
L508682	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
L508921	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Measles.
L508920	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	However, we can also pray for other things.
L508919	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Peace on Earth.
L508903	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
L508902	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
L508884	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
L508883	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
L508655	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really...
L508654	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
L508398	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
L508397	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
L508330	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
L508329	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Yes?
L508328	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sister Mary Patrick?
L508238	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
L508237	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes, Mary Patrick?
L509048	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Impossible.
L509047	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Not a note.
L509038	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Christy.
L509037	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
L508998	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	A Benedictine.
L508997	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
L508969	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	But how do we get there?
L508968	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
L508943	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
L508942	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	It's so beautiful...
L508894	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	She's our inspiration!
L508893	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
L508888	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	She wasn't a nun?
L508887	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	An... entertainer?
L508882	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
L508881	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	You mean -- they kidnapped her?
L508838	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
L508837	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
L508835	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	It's no use.  She just isn't here.
L508834	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence!  Sister!
L508797	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
L508796	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
L508790	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
L508789	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Ice cream!
L508752	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	It's brought people back to the church.
L508751	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
L508742	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	It's better than springtime.
L508741	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	It's better than ice cream.
L508740	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I'd rather sing than do anything!
L508732	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	He's kind.
L508731	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	He's decent.
L508730	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	He's not like other guys.
L508579	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	That was exciting!
L508578	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
L508549	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
L508548	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
L508294	u7633	m516	MARY PATRICK	Which convent was that, Sister?
L508293	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Is this like your old convent?
L509063	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
L509062	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes?
L509061	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Reverend Mother?
L508966	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But where?
L508965	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
L508901	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
L508900	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	She said they were from her old convent.
L508899	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
L508862	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
L508861	u7635	m516	MARY ROBERT	I don't understand.  Where is she?
L508659	u7638	m516	O'HARA	And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
L508658	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
L508174	u7638	m516	O'HARA	I know. 
L508173	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I lied.
L508172	u7638	m516	O'HARA	St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
L508171	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But, Bishop...
L508170	u7638	m516	O'HARA	Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
L508169	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
L508168	u7638	m516	O'HARA	And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
L508167	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
L508166	u7638	m516	O'HARA	We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
L508165	u7637	m516	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
L509024	u7641	m516	VINCE	Find 'em!
L509023	u7642	m516	WILLY	Where?
L508975	u7641	m516	VINCE	Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
L508974	u7642	m516	WILLY	We both missed.
L508949	u7641	m516	VINCE	Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
L508948	u7642	m516	WILLY	She's... she's a nun.
L508937	u7642	m516	WILLY	She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
L508936	u7641	m516	VINCE	And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
L508933	u7641	m516	VINCE	I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
L508932	u7642	m516	WILLY	She's a nun, Vince.
L508380	u7641	m516	VINCE	Can you hold?  Can you try?
L508379	u7642	m516	WILLY	It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
L508378	u7641	m516	VINCE	Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
L508103	u7641	m516	VINCE	She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
L508102	u7642	m516	WILLY	I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
L568344	u8085	m548	MARTIN	Our duty is to help Furtwngler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
L568343	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
L568342	u8085	m548	MARTIN	You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
L568341	u8081	m548	DAVID	I don't know.
L568340	u8085	m548	MARTIN	On Furtwngler.
L568339	u8081	m548	DAVID	On all what?
L568338	u8085	m548	MARTIN	Where do you stand on all this?
L568501	u8081	m548	DAVID	And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
L568500	u8083	m548	EMMI	'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
L568381	u8083	m548	EMMI	I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
L568380	u8081	m548	DAVID	When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
L568379	u8083	m548	EMMI	When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
L568378	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yesterday I read that Furtwngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
L568269	u8081	m548	DAVID	But I promised your mother.
L568268	u8083	m548	EMMI	Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
L568262	u8081	m548	DAVID	I don't know.
L568261	u8083	m548	EMMI	What does he mean, too correct?
L568125	u8081	m548	DAVID	Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
L568124	u8083	m548	EMMI	And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
L568123	u8081	m548	DAVID	Eating is eating... and...
L568122	u8083	m548	EMMI	And no elbows on the table!
L568121	u8081	m548	DAVID	Respect your elders and your betters!
L568120	u8083	m548	EMMI	Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
L568119	u8081	m548	DAVID	That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
L568118	u8083	m548	EMMI	That's because you had a proper upbringing.
L568490	u8088	m548	STEVE	What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
L568489	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
L568488	u8088	m548	STEVE	A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
L568487	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
L568486	u8088	m548	STEVE	David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
L568485	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
L568484	u8088	m548	STEVE	With more what? More what?
L568483	u8081	m548	DAVID	When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
L568482	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah.
L568481	u8081	m548	DAVID	Can I ask you a favour, Major?
L568471	u8088	m548	STEVE	My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
L568470	u8081	m548	DAVID	Your manner.
L568469	u8088	m548	STEVE	What?
L568464	u8088	m548	STEVE	But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
L568463	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
L568458	u8088	m548	STEVE	Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
L568457	u8081	m548	DAVID	and totally irrelevant.
L568456	u8088	m548	STEVE	You bet.
L568455	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
L568454	u8088	m548	STEVE	Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
L568449	u8088	m548	STEVE	David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
L568448	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
L568447	u8088	m548	STEVE	You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
L568410	u8081	m548	DAVID	Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
L568409	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yes, David?
L568153	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
L568152	u8088	m548	STEVE	You have a question for Helmuth, David?
L568137	u8088	m548	STEVE	It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
L568136	u8081	m548	DAVID	Five minutes.
L568135	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
L568134	u8088	m548	STEVE	That's big of him.
L568133	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
L568132	u8088	m548	STEVE	Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
L568131	u8081	m548	DAVID	I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
L568130	u8088	m548	STEVE	What's that mean?
L568129	u8081	m548	DAVID	The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
L568128	u8088	m548	STEVE	So what is it?
L568127	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yes.
L568126	u8088	m548	STEVE	David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
L568098	u8081	m548	DAVID	They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
L568097	u8088	m548	STEVE	What the hell are they doing?
L568096	u8088	m548	STEVE	'Dim-shits'?
L568095	u8081	m548	DAVID	Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
L568094	u8088	m548	STEVE	So, what does the Russki want?
L568093	u8081	m548	DAVID	I guess it's possible.
L568092	u8088	m548	STEVE	You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
L568049	u8088	m548	STEVE	Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
L568048	u8081	m548	DAVID	Some.
L568047	u8088	m548	STEVE	I guess you admire musicians.
L568042	u8081	m548	DAVID	was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
L568041	u8088	m548	STEVE	Where you from, David?
L568040	u8088	m548	STEVE	You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
L568039	u8081	m548	DAVID	I guess so, sir.
L568038	u8088	m548	STEVE	Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
L568037	u8081	m548	DAVID	David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
L568036	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'm Steve. What's your name?
L568035	u8081	m548	DAVID	I'm very sorry.
L568034	u8088	m548	STEVE	For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
L568033	u8081	m548	DAVID	Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
L568376	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Then you're going to kill me.
L568375	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
L568374	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
L568373	u8088	m548	STEVE	I have a duty.
L568372	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Let Furtwngler go. Please.
L568371	u8088	m548	STEVE	No can do.
L568370	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
L568369	u8088	m548	STEVE	What museum?
L568368	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
L568367	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
L568366	u8088	m548	STEVE	This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
L568365	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
L568364	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
L568363	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
L568362	u8088	m548	STEVE	But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
L568361	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
L568360	u8088	m548	STEVE	Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
L568358	u8088	m548	STEVE	That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
L568357	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
L568355	u8088	m548	STEVE	We're dealing with degenerates here.
L568354	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Furtwngler's in a different category.
L568353	u8088	m548	STEVE	I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
L568111	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
L568110	u8088	m548	STEVE	Not yet.
L568109	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
L568108	u8088	m548	STEVE	Colonel. Pleasure.
L568107	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
L568480	u8083	m548	EMMI	I would like to go now, please.
L568479	u8088	m548	STEVE	If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
L568478	u8083	m548	EMMI	But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
L568477	u8088	m548	STEVE	Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
L568476	u8083	m548	EMMI	I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
L568475	u8088	m548	STEVE	What's not right?
L568474	u8083	m548	EMMI	I can't do this. It's not right.
L568473	u8088	m548	STEVE	What is this, Emmi?
L568472	u8083	m548	EMMI	I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
L568385	u8088	m548	STEVE	Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
L568384	u8083	m548	EMMI	Of course.
L568383	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know where the Adagio begins?
L568382	u8083	m548	EMMI	Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
L568167	u8088	m548	STEVE	Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
L568166	u8083	m548	EMMI	Major, Major... he's here ...
L568045	u8088	m548	STEVE	Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
L568044	u8083	m548	EMMI	I'm sorry.
L568031	u8088	m548	STEVE	You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
L568030	u8083	m548	EMMI	The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
L568029	u8088	m548	STEVE	What's in those files?
L568028	u8083	m548	EMMI	No. Ours was damaged.
L568027	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
L568026	u8083	m548	EMMI	But... he only wrote nine, Major.
L568025	u8088	m548	STEVE	Mine's the Eleventh.
L568024	u8083	m548	EMMI	Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
L568023	u8088	m548	STEVE	Think you can get me any of that?
L568021	u8083	m548	EMMI	There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
L568020	u8088	m548	STEVE	Steve.
L568015	u8088	m548	STEVE	And your father was executed.
L568014	u8083	m548	EMMI	Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
L568013	u8088	m548	STEVE	Your mother, too.
L568012	u8083	m548	EMMI	My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
L568011	u8088	m548	STEVE	Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
L568010	u8083	m548	EMMI	Three months.
L568009	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
L568008	u8083	m548	EMMI	Yes.
L568007	u8088	m548	STEVE	You do shorthand and typing?
L568006	u8083	m548	EMMI	Yes.
L568005	u8088	m548	STEVE	You live here, in Berlin?
L568516	u8088	m548	STEVE	Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
L568515	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
L568514	u8088	m548	STEVE	Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
L568511	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
L568510	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	How can I know such a thing?
L568507	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who's conducting?
L568506	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
L568505	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, so what is it?
L568504	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Of course I know what that is.
L568503	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know what that is?
L568496	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
L568495	u8088	m548	STEVE	I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
L568494	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Those attitudes do not exist in me.
L568493	u8088	m548	STEVE	Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
L568467	u8088	m548	STEVE	No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
L568466	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't understand what you mean.
L568465	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
L568462	u8088	m548	STEVE	But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
L568461	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
L568460	u8088	m548	STEVE	No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
L568459	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Stop this, please, stop this now!
L568453	u8088	m548	STEVE	You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
L568452	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
L568451	u8088	m548	STEVE	What?
L568450	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have illegitimate children.
L568446	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
L568445	u8088	m548	STEVE	Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
L568444	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	This is absolute nonsense!
L568443	u8088	m548	STEVE	Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
L568441	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Yes, that's what happened.
L568440	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
L568439	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
L568436	u8088	m548	STEVE	Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
L568435	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I'm sorry.
L568434	u8088	m548	STEVE	You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
L568433	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have no idea.
L568432	u8088	m548	STEVE	And what happened to Von der Nul?
L568431	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
L568430	u8088	m548	STEVE	And what did he say?
L568429	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
L568428	u8088	m548	STEVE	You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
L568427	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	That's an outrageous lie!
L568426	u8088	m548	STEVE	Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
L568425	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Yes, I know who he is.
L568424	u8088	m548	STEVE	How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
L568423	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Von der Null?
L568422	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yes, von der Null.
L568421	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Von der Null?
L568420	u8088	m548	STEVE	Tell me about von der Null.
L568419	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
L568418	u8088	m548	STEVE	No!
L568417	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	have no idea what ordinary people thought.
L568416	u8088	m548	STEVE	You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
L568415	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
L568414	u8088	m548	STEVE	Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
L568413	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Then you are wrong.
L568412	u8088	m548	STEVE	Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
L568411	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
L568408	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
L568407	u8088	m548	STEVE	Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
L568406	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
L568405	u8088	m548	STEVE	The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
L568404	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have no idea what you're talking about.
L568403	u8088	m548	STEVE	'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
L568402	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	What telegram?
L568401	u8088	m548	STEVE	And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
L568400	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
L568399	u8088	m548	STEVE	Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
L568398	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
L568397	u8088	m548	STEVE	And what was that?
L568396	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
L568395	u8088	m548	STEVE	Go ahead, be my guest.
L568394	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I wish to say something.
L568393	u8088	m548	STEVE	If it's too hot, open your tie.
L568387	u8088	m548	STEVE	Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
L568386	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
L568250	u8088	m548	STEVE	Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
L568249	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
L568248	u8088	m548	STEVE	What did Goering say?
L568247	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
L568246	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who warned you?
L568245	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I was warned.
L568244	u8088	m548	STEVE	How?
L568243	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I wasn't told. I just knew it.
L568242	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who?
L568241	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
L568240	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
L568239	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
L568238	u8088	m548	STEVE	I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
L568232	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
L568231	u8088	m548	STEVE	Steve Arnold...
L568226	u8088	m548	STEVE	See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
L568225	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
L568224	u8088	m548	STEVE	I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
L568222	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
L568221	u8088	m548	STEVE	You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
L568220	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
L568219	u8088	m548	STEVE	You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
L568218	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
L568217	u8088	m548	STEVE	So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
L568216	u8088	m548	STEVE	You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
L568215	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
L568214	u8088	m548	STEVE	Why were they going to arrest you?
L568213	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
L568212	u8088	m548	STEVE	I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
L568211	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
L568210	u8088	m548	STEVE	Tough, tough!
L568209	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
L568208	u8088	m548	STEVE	Your guess is as good as mine.
L568207	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
L568206	u8088	m548	STEVE	Sure.
L568205	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	May I ask a question?
L568204	u8088	m548	STEVE	Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
L568203	u8088	m548	STEVE	Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
L568202	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
L568201	u8088	m548	STEVE	Did you call someone you knew?
L568200	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
L568199	u8088	m548	STEVE	I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
L568198	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It's the truth.
L568197	u8088	m548	STEVE	I don't buy that.
L568196	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I made no deal!
L568192	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
L568191	u8088	m548	STEVE	How come?
L568190	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
L568189	u8088	m548	STEVE	That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
L568188	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
L568187	u8088	m548	STEVE	Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
L568184	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
L568183	u8088	m548	STEVE	Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
L568182	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
L568181	u8088	m548	STEVE	What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
L568180	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
L568179	u8088	m548	STEVE	Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
L568178	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	That is correct.
L568177	u8088	m548	STEVE	What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
L568176	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
L568175	u8088	m548	STEVE	I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
L568336	u8088	m548	STEVE	His private life?
L568335	u8086	m548	RODE	And ask him about his private life.
L568334	u8086	m548	RODE	Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
L568333	u8088	m548	STEVE	The Miracle Kid.
L568332	u8086	m548	RODE	Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
L568331	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who's he?
L568330	u8086	m548	RODE	Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
L568329	u8088	m548	STEVE	Never heard of him, who is he?
L568328	u8086	m548	RODE	There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
L568327	u8086	m548	RODE	No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
L568326	u8088	m548	STEVE	But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
L568325	u8088	m548	STEVE	Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
L568324	u8086	m548	RODE	Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
L568323	u8088	m548	STEVE	One of my people?
L568322	u8086	m548	RODE	One of your people told me.
L568321	u8088	m548	STEVE	He did?
L568320	u8086	m548	RODE	Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
L568319	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah?
L568318	u8086	m548	RODE	I've remembered something else...
L568317	u8088	m548	STEVE	Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
L568316	u8086	m548	RODE	The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
L568315	u8088	m548	STEVE	Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
L568314	u8086	m548	RODE	Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
L568313	u8088	m548	STEVE	I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
L568309	u8086	m548	RODE	You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
L568308	u8088	m548	STEVE	Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
L568307	u8086	m548	RODE	I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
L568306	u8088	m548	STEVE	Was a member of...?  Speak up?
L568300	u8088	m548	STEVE	One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
L568299	u8086	m548	RODE	What?
L568298	u8088	m548	STEVE	All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
L568297	u8086	m548	RODE	You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
L568296	u8086	m548	RODE	So. You wanted to see me.
L568295	u8088	m548	STEVE	Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
L568293	u8088	m548	STEVE	Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
L568292	u8086	m548	RODE	Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
L568291	u8088	m548	STEVE	And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
L568288	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do it, Helmuth.
L568287	u8086	m548	RODE	Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
L568286	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
L568285	u8086	m548	RODE	Show you?
L568284	u8088	m548	STEVE	Show me.
L568283	u8088	m548	STEVE	How could I forget?
L568282	u8086	m548	RODE	Yes, you remember.
L568281	u8088	m548	STEVE	The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
L568280	u8086	m548	RODE	It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
L568279	u8088	m548	STEVE	Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
L568278	u8086	m548	RODE	Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
L568277	u8088	m548	STEVE	Helmuth.
L568276	u8086	m548	RODE	Major.
L568163	u8086	m548	RODE	How could I know what's in the archive?
L568162	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know what's in this archive?
L568161	u8086	m548	RODE	I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
L568160	u8086	m548	RODE	Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
L568159	u8088	m548	STEVE	You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
L568158	u8086	m548	RODE	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
L568157	u8088	m548	STEVE	That's what I asked.
L568156	u8086	m548	RODE	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
L568155	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know Hans Hinkel?
L568154	u8086	m548	RODE	Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
L568145	u8086	m548	RODE	Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
L568144	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
L568143	u8086	m548	RODE	Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
L568141	u8086	m548	RODE	Me? Never.  Never.
L568140	u8088	m548	STEVE	Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
L568139	u8086	m548	RODE	It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
L568138	u8088	m548	STEVE	Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
L568091	u8088	m548	STEVE	When you got to the crescendo.
L568090	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	I don't know what you mean, Major.
L568089	u8088	m548	STEVE	Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
L568088	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	Yes.
L568087	u8088	m548	STEVE	You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
L568085	u8088	m548	STEVE	Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
L568084	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
L568083	u8088	m548	STEVE	Oh! The evening before, I see...
L568080	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
L568079	u8088	m548	STEVE	But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
L568078	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
L567994	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
L567993	u8088	m548	STEVE	Like this bandleader.
L567992	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
L567991	u8088	m548	STEVE	They said I was dogged?
L567990	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Conscientious, determined, dogged.
L567989	u8088	m548	STEVE	Right. Claims assessor.
L567988	u8089	m548	WALLACE	You were in insurance before the war.
L567987	u8088	m548	STEVE	Jeez, and I never heard of him.
L567986	u8089	m548	WALLACE	He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
L567985	u8088	m548	STEVE	Sure.
L567984	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
L567983	u8088	m548	STEVE	Nope.
L567982	u8089	m548	WALLACE	So, you never heard of him.
L568071	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
L568070	u8090	m548	WERNER	It was Beethoven's Ninth.
L568069	u8088	m548	STEVE	Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
L568068	u8090	m548	WERNER	Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
L568067	u8088	m548	STEVE	He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
L568066	u8090	m548	WERNER	It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
L568065	u8088	m548	STEVE	Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
L568064	u8090	m548	WERNER	Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
L568060	u8088	m548	STEVE	Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
L568059	u8090	m548	WERNER	No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
L568058	u8090	m548	WERNER	Absolutely not.
L568057	u8088	m548	STEVE	I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
L568056	u8090	m548	WERNER	First oboe.
L568055	u8088	m548	STEVE	Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
