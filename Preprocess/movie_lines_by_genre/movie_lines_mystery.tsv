L3778	u55	m3	FLOYD	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
L3777	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3771	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
L3770	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3757	u55	m3	FLOYD	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
L3756	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3750	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
L3749	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3729	u55	m3	FLOYD	She's wonderful.
L3728	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3721	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
L3720	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3713	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
L3712	u49	m3	B20	SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
L4300	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Roger.
L4299	u60	m3	POOLE	I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
L4298	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess not.
L4297	u60	m3	POOLE	I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
L4296	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
L4283	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
L4282	u60	m3	POOLE	It's the last one.
L4209	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L4208	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal?
L4199	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
L4198	u60	m3	POOLE	Two more.
L4197	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
L4196	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
L4193	u60	m3	POOLE	No.
L4192	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You're kidding.
L4191	u60	m3	POOLE	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
L4190	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
L4189	u60	m3	POOLE	Are you reasonably awake?
L4188	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Good morning. How's it going?
L4163	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
L4162	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
L4161	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
L4160	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
L4159	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, that's something.
L4017	u60	m3	POOLE	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
L4016	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess it isn't.
L4015	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
L4014	u50	m3	BOWMAN	But not completely inconceivable?
L4013	u60	m3	POOLE	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
L4012	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
L4011	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
L4001	u60	m3	POOLE	That's true.
L4000	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
L3999	u60	m3	POOLE	How?
L3998	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
L3997	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, I thought so.
L3996	u50	m3	BOWMAN	That seems very unlikely.
L3995	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
L3992	u60	m3	POOLE	Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
L3991	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
L3990	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
L3989	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh?
L3988	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
L3987	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose the idea was specialized training.
L3984	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No. I never did, either.
L3983	u60	m3	POOLE	I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
L3982	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
L3981	u60	m3	POOLE	Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
L3980	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It's possible.
L3979	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
L3976	u60	m3	POOLE	Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
L3975	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L3974	u60	m3	POOLE	Really.
L3973	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
L3972	u60	m3	POOLE	That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
L3969	u60	m3	POOLE	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
L3968	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes?
L3967	u60	m3	POOLE	It's about my salary cheques.
L3966	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What's up?
L3965	u60	m3	POOLE	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
L3964	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Sure, what is it?
L3963	u60	m3	POOLE	Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
L3945	u60	m3	POOLE	Okay, come on down.
L3944	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay. 
L3943	u60	m3	POOLE	Right. Just a sec.
L3942	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
L4368	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
L4367	u56	m3	HAL	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
L4366	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I am prepared to do that anyway.
L4363	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
L4362	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
L4361	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
L4360	u56	m3	HAL	I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
L4357	u56	m3	HAL	I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
L4356	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
L4355	u56	m3	HAL	Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
L4354	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
L4353	u56	m3	HAL	If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
L4350	u56	m3	HAL	I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
L4349	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
L4348	u56	m3	HAL	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
L4347	u50	m3	BOWMAN	The antenna has to be replaced.
L4346	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
L4335	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
L4334	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, it is.
L4333	u56	m3	HAL	Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
L4271	u56	m3	HAL	Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
L4270	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, it is, Hal.
L4269	u56	m3	HAL	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
L4268	u50	m3	BOWMAN	And don't you worry about it.
L4267	u56	m3	HAL	Well, don't worry about it.
L4266	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
L4265	u56	m3	HAL	Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
L4230	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
L4229	u56	m3	HAL	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
L4228	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
L4227	u56	m3	HAL	I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
L4224	u56	m3	HAL	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
L4223	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You probably also know that we found them okay.
L4222	u56	m3	HAL	Yes, I know.
L4221	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
L4220	u56	m3	HAL	Sure, Dave, what's up?
L4219	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
L4080	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
L4079	u56	m3	HAL	The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
L4070	u56	m3	HAL	MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
L4069	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What is it, Hal?
L4068	u56	m3	HAL	Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
L4007	u50	m3	BOWMAN	He's got a point.
L4006	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
L4019	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
L4018	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4010	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
L4009	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4003	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
L4002	u51	m3	C12	CONINUED
L3994	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, what is it?
L3993	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3978	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Did they have any explanation for this?
L3977	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3971	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
L3970	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3693	u52	m3	CHILD	Goodbye, Daddy.
L3692	u55	m3	FLOYD	'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
L3691	u52	m3	CHILD	Yes, Daddy.
L3690	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
L3689	u52	m3	CHILD	Thank you, Daddy.
L3688	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
L3685	u55	m3	FLOYD	Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
L3684	u52	m3	CHILD	How many days until you come home?
L3683	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
L3682	u52	m3	CHILD	She's in the bathroom.
L3681	u55	m3	FLOYD	Where is Mrs. Brown?
L3680	u52	m3	CHILD	Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
L3679	u55	m3	FLOYD	One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
L3677	u55	m3	FLOYD	In three days, darling, I hope.
L3676	u52	m3	CHILD	When are you coming home?
L3675	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
L3674	u52	m3	CHILD	Are you coming to my party?
L3673	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
L3672	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm having a party tomorrow.
L3669	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
L3668	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
L3810	u59	m3	PILOT	I'll bet it's a fortune.
L3809	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
L3808	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
L3807	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
L3806	u59	m3	PILOT	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
L3805	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
L3799	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, how's it going back there?
L3798	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Thank you.
L3797	u59	m3	PILOT	Oh, thank you very much.
L3780	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
L3779	u54	m3	ELENA	Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
L3776	u54	m3	ELENA	Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
L3775	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
L3774	u54	m3	ELENA	Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
L3759	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, that does sound very odd.
L3758	u54	m3	ELENA	Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
L3735	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, where are all of you off to?
L3734	u54	m3	ELENA	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
L3733	u55	m3	FLOYD	How is gregor?
L3732	u54	m3	ELENA	Oh, that's such a delightful age.
L3731	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
L3730	u54	m3	ELENA	And your charming little daughter?
L3653	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, it's coming along very well.
L3652	u58	m3	MILLER	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
L3651	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, I think so. Just about then.
L3631	u55	m3	FLOYD	Fine.
L3630	u58	m3	MILLER	Well, shall we go through Documentation?
L3629	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, very pleasant.
L3628	u58	m3	MILLER	Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
L3627	u55	m3	FLOYD	Please, it really doesn't matter.
L3626	u58	m3	MILLER	Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
L3623	u58	m3	MILLER	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
L3622	u55	m3	FLOYD	How do you do, Mr. Miller?
L3773	u55	m3	FLOYD	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
L3772	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
L3768	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
L3767	u55	m3	FLOYD	Certainly.
L3766	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
L3763	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, I'm glad about that.
L3762	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Fortunately, they did.
L3761	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
L3760	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
L3754	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3753	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	That's right.
L3752	u55	m3	FLOYD	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
L3751	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
L3748	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
L3747	u55	m3	FLOYD	Really?
L3746	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
L3745	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
L3740	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
L3739	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
L3738	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
L3726	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, really, thank you very much.
L3725	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you quite sure?
L3724	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
L3907	u57	m3	MICHAELS	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
L3906	u55	m3	FLOYD	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
L3905	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
L3904	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any ideas about the colour?
L3897	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
L3896	u55	m3	FLOYD	But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
L3893	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
L3892	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any clue as to what it is?
L3891	u57	m3	MICHAELS	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
L3890	u55	m3	FLOYD	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
L3889	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
L3869	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
L3868	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
L3839	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
L3838	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
L3837	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
L3834	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
L3833	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
L3832	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
L3829	u59	m3	PILOT	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
L3828	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3827	u59	m3	PILOT	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
L3826	u55	m3	FLOYD	What do you mean?
L3825	u59	m3	PILOT	Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
L3824	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you.
L3821	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
L3820	u59	m3	PILOT	We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
L3819	u55	m3	FLOYD	When do we arrive at Clavius?
L3818	u59	m3	PILOT	There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
L3817	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
L4183	u60	m3	POOLE	All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
L4182	u56	m3	HAL	Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
L4181	u60	m3	POOLE	Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
L4175	u60	m3	POOLE	Let me see the tracking alignment display.
L4174	u56	m3	HAL	I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
L4170	u56	m3	HAL	It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
L4169	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, Hal, what's up?
L4119	u60	m3	POOLE	Opening pod bay doors.
L4118	u56	m3	HAL	Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
L4113	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
L4112	u56	m3	HAL	Roger.
L4111	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
L4110	u56	m3	HAL	I understand.
L4109	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
L4108	u56	m3	HAL	Five by five, Frank.
L4097	u56	m3	HAL	Roger.
L4096	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
L4033	u60	m3	POOLE	Thank you very much, Hal.
L4032	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4031	u60	m3	POOLE	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
L4030	u56	m3	HAL	That's true
L4029	u60	m3	POOLE	Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
L4028	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4025	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4024	u60	m3	POOLE	Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
L4023	u56	m3	HAL	True.
L4022	u60	m3	POOLE	Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
L4021	u56	m3	HAL	I will if I can, Frank.
L4020	u60	m3	POOLE	Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
L7002	u114	m6	WELLES	I just talked to her.
L7001	u100	m6	AMY	She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
L7000	u100	m6	AMY	Tom... she's dead.
L6999	u114	m6	WELLES	She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
L6998	u100	m6	AMY	What?
L6997	u114	m6	WELLES	Mrs. Christian.
L6996	u100	m6	AMY	Who are you calling?
L6993	u114	m6	WELLES	Amy...
L6992	u100	m6	AMY	What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
L6991	u114	m6	WELLES	Don't...
L6990	u100	m6	AMY	You're killing me...
L6989	u114	m6	WELLES	I don't know what to say
L6988	u100	m6	AMY	Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
L6987	u114	m6	WELLES	Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
L6986	u100	m6	AMY	You should have.
L6985	u114	m6	WELLES	I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
L6984	u100	m6	AMY	No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
L6983	u114	m6	WELLES	You don't understand...
L6982	u100	m6	AMY	You couldn't?
L6981	u114	m6	WELLES	I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
L6980	u100	m6	AMY	You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
L6979	u100	m6	AMY	You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
L6978	u114	m6	WELLES	I don't know.  I'm sorry...
L6977	u100	m6	AMY	Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
L6976	u114	m6	WELLES	It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
L6975	u100	m6	AMY	Tom...
L6974	u114	m6	WELLES	I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
L6973	u100	m6	AMY	What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
L6972	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
L6971	u100	m6	AMY	What happened to you?
L6964	u114	m6	WELLES	Just do it, Amy, please, go.
L6963	u100	m6	AMY	... What's going on?
L6962	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
L6961	u100	m6	AMY	What's wrong?  Are you alright?
L6960	u114	m6	WELLES	Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
L6959	u100	m6	AMY	Tom?  Where have you been... ?
L6958	u114	m6	WELLES	Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
L6957	u100	m6	AMY	Hello?
L6435	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
L6434	u100	m6	AMY	Why the gun?
L6433	u114	m6	WELLES	It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
L6432	u100	m6	AMY	I know.
L6431	u114	m6	WELLES	Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
L6430	u100	m6	AMY	I understand.
L6429	u114	m6	WELLES	This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
L6365	u100	m6	AMY	Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
L6364	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
L6363	u100	m6	AMY	You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
L6362	u114	m6	WELLES	Sure.  I'll call the guy.
L6361	u100	m6	AMY	You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
L6352	u114	m6	WELLES	I love you.
L6351	u100	m6	AMY	I love you.
L6350	u114	m6	WELLES	Honey, I'm not, please...
L6349	u100	m6	AMY	You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
L6348	u114	m6	WELLES	Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
L6347	u100	m6	AMY	How's the detective business?
L6344	u114	m6	WELLES	We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
L6343	u100	m6	AMY	Okay, I believe you.
L6342	u114	m6	WELLES	Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
L6341	u100	m6	AMY	I'm not accusing you...
L6340	u114	m6	WELLES	"You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even ""hello,"" you accuse me... ?"
L6339	u100	m6	AMY	Your clothing reeks of it.
L6338	u114	m6	WELLES	Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
L6337	u100	m6	AMY	What's this... have you been smoking... ?
L6336	u114	m6	WELLES	Do you know how much I missed you?
L6335	u100	m6	AMY	Welcome home.
L6612	u101	m6	ANGRY DEALER	There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
L6611	u114	m6	WELLES	You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
L6610	u101	m6	ANGRY DEALER	What you see is what I got, mister.
L6609	u114	m6	WELLES	Snuff?
L6608	u101	m6	ANGRY DEALER	There's nothing harder.
L6607	u114	m6	WELLES	Anything harder?
L6606	u101	m6	ANGRY DEALER	Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
L6605	u114	m6	WELLES	What are these?
L6910	u102	m6	DINO	I promised him to Machine.
L6909	u105	m6	EDDIE	What the fuck... !
L6717	u102	m6	DINO	Nobody knows anything.
L6716	u105	m6	EDDIE	Dino...
L6715	u102	m6	DINO	There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
L6714	u105	m6	EDDIE	Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
L6713	u102	m6	DINO	Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
L6712	u105	m6	EDDIE	I'm telling you...
L6711	u102	m6	DINO	Bullshit.
L6710	u105	m6	EDDIE	The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
L6709	u102	m6	DINO	What are you talking about?
L6708	u105	m6	EDDIE	I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
L6707	u102	m6	DINO	What do you want?
L6864	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
L6863	u114	m6	WELLES	I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
L6862	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Bring the film, or we kill him.
L6861	u114	m6	WELLES	He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
L6860	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
L6859	u114	m6	WELLES	Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
L6858	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Friend of yours?
L6853	u114	m6	WELLES	I remember him.
L6852	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
L6846	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
L6845	u114	m6	WELLES	Look, I don't know what this...
L6844	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
L6842	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Take out your gun!
L6841	u114	m6	WELLES	What are you... ?
L6840	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
L6835	u114	m6	WELLES	Sure.
L6834	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
L6833	u114	m6	WELLES	What are these for?
L6832	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	They should be here any minute.
L6831	u114	m6	WELLES	Where are the women?
L6830	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Excellent.
L6829	u114	m6	WELLES	Right here.
L6828	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	You brought the money?
L6815	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
L6814	u114	m6	WELLES	Where's that?
L6812	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
L6811	u114	m6	WELLES	Machine's in?
L6810	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
L6808	u114	m6	WELLES	Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
L6807	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
L6806	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm camera shy.
L6805	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	What's the problem?
L6804	u114	m6	WELLES	I'd rather you didn't.
L6803	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
L6802	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
L6801	u114	m6	WELLES	We can do that.
L6800	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
L6799	u114	m6	WELLES	If it's not him, there's no deal.
L6798	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Machine.
L6797	u114	m6	WELLES	And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
L6796	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	I'll consider it.
L6795	u114	m6	WELLES	I want to watch you work.
L6794	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	And they are?
L6793	u114	m6	WELLES	Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
L6792	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Is it?
L6791	u114	m6	WELLES	That's five thousand dollars.
L6790	u114	m6	WELLES	Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
L6789	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	You said something about money.
L6784	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Hmm.
L6783	u114	m6	WELLES	A fellow investor.
L6782	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
L6781	u114	m6	WELLES	I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
L6780	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	What can I do for you today?
L6779	u114	m6	WELLES	It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
L6936	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	You betrayed us.
L6935	u105	m6	EDDIE	You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
L6912	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
L6911	u105	m6	EDDIE	... sorry...
L6908	u105	m6	EDDIE	Fuck off.
L6907	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Leave him alone.
L6906	u105	m6	EDDIE	You're a dead man.
L6866	u105	m6	EDDIE	Move it, dirtbag... !
L6865	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
L6848	u103	m6	DINO VELVET	Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
L6847	u105	m6	EDDIE	Is that him?
L6464	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	It's good what you're doing.
L6463	u114	m6	WELLES	You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
L6462	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
L6461	u114	m6	WELLES	Any good?
L6460	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
L6454	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
L6453	u114	m6	WELLES	They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
L6452	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
L6451	u114	m6	WELLES	They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
L6450	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	I'm not so sure about this.
L6449	u114	m6	WELLES	This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
L6448	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	Why don't they come to me?
L6447	u114	m6	WELLES	For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
L6446	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	We do.
L6445	u114	m6	WELLES	I figured you share information.
L6444	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
L6443	u114	m6	WELLES	Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
L6442	u114	m6	WELLES	Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
L6441	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	There are reasons for the way we do things here.
L6440	u114	m6	WELLES	What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
L6439	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	Alright, Tom.
L6438	u114	m6	WELLES	Call me Tom.
L6437	u104	m6	DIRECTOR	What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
L7076	u105	m6	EDDIE	What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
L7075	u114	m6	WELLES	"That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you ""felt like it.""  Almost makes you worse."
L7074	u105	m6	EDDIE	I never killed anyone.
L7073	u114	m6	WELLES	Easy enough for you.
L7072	u105	m6	EDDIE	Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
L7071	u114	m6	WELLES	Don't think I won't.
L7070	u105	m6	EDDIE	Do it.
L7067	u105	m6	EDDIE	I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
L7066	u114	m6	WELLES	Where?  Show me where.
L7065	u105	m6	EDDIE	I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
L7064	u114	m6	WELLES	Show me where you buried her.
L7063	u105	m6	EDDIE	You got absolute zero.
L7062	u114	m6	WELLES	Stop talking.
L7061	u105	m6	EDDIE	You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
L7060	u105	m6	EDDIE	Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
L7059	u114	m6	WELLES	Keep moving.
L7057	u114	m6	WELLES	Show me.
L7056	u105	m6	EDDIE	Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
L7055	u114	m6	WELLES	What did you do with her body?
L7054	u105	m6	EDDIE	There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
L7053	u114	m6	WELLES	Nobody saw you bring her in?
L7052	u105	m6	EDDIE	What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
L7051	u114	m6	WELLES	Tell me what happened.
L7050	u105	m6	EDDIE	Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
L7049	u114	m6	WELLES	You enjoy it?
L7048	u105	m6	EDDIE	I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
L7045	u114	m6	WELLES	Because we're going there.
L7044	u105	m6	EDDIE	Why?
L7043	u114	m6	WELLES	Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
L7039	u105	m6	EDDIE	Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
L7038	u114	m6	WELLES	I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
L7037	u105	m6	EDDIE	What the fuck do you want from me?
L7036	u114	m6	WELLES	What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
L7035	u105	m6	EDDIE	Something like that.
L7034	u114	m6	WELLES	So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
L7033	u105	m6	EDDIE	It was a lot of fucking money.
L7032	u114	m6	WELLES	That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
L7031	u105	m6	EDDIE	Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
L7030	u114	m6	WELLES	How much did he pay you?
L7029	u105	m6	EDDIE	Yeah.
L7028	u114	m6	WELLES	Told him you could get him a snuff film.
L7027	u105	m6	EDDIE	Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
L7026	u114	m6	WELLES	Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
L7025	u105	m6	EDDIE	What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
L7024	u114	m6	WELLES	I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
L7023	u105	m6	EDDIE	I told you, I don't know.
L7022	u114	m6	WELLES	I want his name.
L7021	u105	m6	EDDIE	I don't know...
L7020	u114	m6	WELLES	Who is Machine?
L7019	u105	m6	EDDIE	What do you want?
L7018	u114	m6	WELLES	Starting to recognize a pattern?
L7017	u105	m6	EDDIE	Fuck you!
L7016	u114	m6	WELLES	Don't ask questions.
L7015	u105	m6	EDDIE	How'd you find me here?
L7014	u114	m6	WELLES	Don't bore me with that bullshit.
L7013	u105	m6	EDDIE	I'm gonna kill you.
L6920	u114	m6	WELLES	One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
L6919	u105	m6	EDDIE	What's he talking about?
L6702	u114	m6	WELLES	You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
L6701	u105	m6	EDDIE	What the fuck are you.. ?
L6700	u114	m6	WELLES	You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
L6699	u105	m6	EDDIE	Who is this.
L6698	u114	m6	WELLES	I know what you did.
L6697	u105	m6	EDDIE	What?
L6696	u114	m6	WELLES	I know what you did.
L6695	u105	m6	EDDIE	Yeah, who's this?
L6694	u114	m6	WELLES	Eddie.
L6693	u105	m6	EDDIE	Celebrity Films.
L6692	u105	m6	EDDIE	Fuck you!
L6691	u107	m6	MALE VOICE	Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
L6690	u105	m6	EDDIE	Look, you cocksucker...
L6689	u107	m6	MALE VOICE	The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
L6688	u105	m6	EDDIE	Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
L6687	u107	m6	MALE VOICE	I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
L6686	u105	m6	EDDIE	You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
L6922	u114	m6	WELLES	Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
L6921	u106	m6	LONGDALE	He's lying.
L6903	u114	m6	WELLES	Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
L6902	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Give me the film.
L6901	u114	m6	WELLES	You'll get it when we get there.
L6900	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Give me the film.
L6899	u114	m6	WELLES	Fuck you.
L6898	u106	m6	LONGDALE	You almost went over your limit.
L6894	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
L6893	u114	m6	WELLES	Enlighten me.
L6892	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Isn't it incredibly obvious?
L6891	u114	m6	WELLES	Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
L6890	u106	m6	LONGDALE	A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
L6889	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm asking.
L6888	u106	m6	LONGDALE	You're asking me why?
L6887	u114	m6	WELLES	Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
L6886	u106	m6	LONGDALE	You're making me very angry.
L6885	u114	m6	WELLES	Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
L6884	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Shut your mouth and drive!
L6883	u114	m6	WELLES	Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
L6882	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Shut up.
L6881	u114	m6	WELLES	You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
L6880	u114	m6	WELLES	Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
L6879	u106	m6	LONGDALE	None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
L6878	u114	m6	WELLES	Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
L6877	u106	m6	LONGDALE	They're no friends of mine.
L6876	u114	m6	WELLES	Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
L6875	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Never mind how I found you.
L6874	u114	m6	WELLES	That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
L6873	u106	m6	LONGDALE	I was well compensated.
L6872	u114	m6	WELLES	Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
L6871	u106	m6	LONGDALE	That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
L6870	u114	m6	WELLES	So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
L6869	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
L6868	u114	m6	WELLES	You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
L6380	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
L6379	u114	m6	WELLES	That's right.
L6378	u106	m6	LONGDALE	You are a private investigator?
L6377	u114	m6	WELLES	Of what sort?
L6376	u106	m6	LONGDALE	As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
L6375	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm listening.
L6374	u106	m6	LONGDALE	Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
L6824	u114	m6	WELLES	It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
L6823	u108	m6	MAX	Look... that's awful generous and everything...
L6822	u114	m6	WELLES	It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
L6821	u108	m6	MAX	What's this?
L6819	u114	m6	WELLES	Nope.
L6818	u108	m6	MAX	Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
L6817	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
L6816	u108	m6	MAX	What's next?
L6788	u114	m6	WELLES	Devil frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
L6787	u108	m6	MAX	"I know if I had to pick, it'd be ""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""
L6769	u108	m6	MAX	What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
L6768	u114	m6	WELLES	You don't need to be here.
L6765	u108	m6	MAX	"Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself ""Machine,"" that's what they call him.  Machine."
L6764	u114	m6	WELLES	Who is he, his name?
L6763	u108	m6	MAX	I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
L6762	u114	m6	WELLES	Who is he?
L6758	u114	m6	WELLES	Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
L6757	u108	m6	MAX	Wha... ?
L6754	u114	m6	WELLES	It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
L6753	u108	m6	MAX	Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
L6752	u108	m6	MAX	Great.
L6751	u114	m6	WELLES	It's their Presidential Suite.
L6750	u108	m6	MAX	You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
L6737	u108	m6	MAX	See ya.
L6736	u114	m6	WELLES	Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
L6735	u108	m6	MAX	You want me to come out there and play private eye?
L6734	u114	m6	WELLES	Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
L6733	u108	m6	MAX	I'm a working stiff, pops.
L6732	u114	m6	WELLES	Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
L6731	u108	m6	MAX	He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
L6730	u114	m6	WELLES	Alright, I get the picture.
L6729	u108	m6	MAX	Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
L6728	u108	m6	MAX	Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
L6727	u114	m6	WELLES	Where does he sell it?
L6726	u108	m6	MAX	You're learning.
L6725	u114	m6	WELLES	Specialty product.
L6724	u108	m6	MAX	His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
L6723	u114	m6	WELLES	A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
L6722	u108	m6	MAX	Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
L6637	u114	m6	WELLES	Good question.
L6636	u108	m6	MAX	So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
L6635	u114	m6	WELLES	A daughter.
L6634	u108	m6	MAX	I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
L6633	u114	m6	WELLES	What about me?
L6632	u108	m6	MAX	You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
L6631	u114	m6	WELLES	You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
L6630	u108	m6	MAX	Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
L6629	u114	m6	WELLES	You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
L6628	u108	m6	MAX	I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
L6627	u114	m6	WELLES	I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
L6626	u108	m6	MAX	I don't know, where are yours?
L6625	u114	m6	WELLES	Where are your parents?
L6624	u108	m6	MAX	Twenty-five.
L6623	u114	m6	WELLES	How old are you?
L6622	u108	m6	MAX	First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
L6621	u114	m6	WELLES	What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
L6620	u108	m6	MAX	I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
L6619	u114	m6	WELLES	Snuff films.
L6618	u108	m6	MAX	There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
L6617	u114	m6	WELLES	Child pornography.
L6616	u108	m6	MAX	What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
L6615	u114	m6	WELLES	Interesting theory.
L6614	u108	m6	MAX	You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
L6598	u108	m6	MAX	Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
L6597	u114	m6	WELLES	... Hello... ?
L6596	u114	m6	WELLES	"See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
L6595	u108	m6	MAX	Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
L6594	u114	m6	WELLES	Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
L6593	u108	m6	MAX	Sounds good, pops.
L6592	u114	m6	WELLES	Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
L6591	u108	m6	MAX	Four hundred a week, off the books.
L6590	u114	m6	WELLES	How much do you make now?
L6589	u108	m6	MAX	How much?
L6588	u114	m6	WELLES	Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
L6587	u108	m6	MAX	From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
L6586	u114	m6	WELLES	Not quite.
L6585	u108	m6	MAX	You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
L6584	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm not a cop.
L6583	u108	m6	MAX	You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
L6582	u114	m6	WELLES	Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
L6581	u108	m6	MAX	There's not much illegal.
L6580	u114	m6	WELLES	Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
L6579	u108	m6	MAX	Max.
L6578	u114	m6	WELLES	What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
L6577	u108	m6	MAX	Three, four years.
L6576	u114	m6	WELLES	How long you been working there?
L6575	u114	m6	WELLES	Good for you.
L6574	u108	m6	MAX	I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
L6571	u108	m6	MAX	Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
L6570	u114	m6	WELLES	I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
L6569	u108	m6	MAX	Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
L6568	u114	m6	WELLES	Remember me?
L6561	u108	m6	MAX	Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
L6560	u114	m6	WELLES	Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
L6559	u108	m6	MAX	I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
L6558	u114	m6	WELLES	Truman Capote.
L6557	u114	m6	WELLES	Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
L6556	u108	m6	MAX	Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
L6553	u114	m6	WELLES	I'll risk it.
L6552	u108	m6	MAX	It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
L6551	u114	m6	WELLES	Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
L6550	u108	m6	MAX	My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
L6549	u114	m6	WELLES	Pardon me?
L6548	u108	m6	MAX	Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
L6547	u114	m6	WELLES	Yeah... guess so.
L6546	u108	m6	MAX	Big date tonight?
L6749	u114	m6	WELLES	If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
L6748	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	How will I get it to you?
L6747	u114	m6	WELLES	I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
L6746	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Fine...
L6745	u114	m6	WELLES	I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
L6744	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
L6743	u114	m6	WELLES	I hope it's nothing serious.
L6742	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
L6741	u114	m6	WELLES	I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
L6740	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	How are you?  Having any luck?
L6739	u114	m6	WELLES	Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
L6738	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Hello?
L6655	u114	m6	WELLES	You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
L6654	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	You told me to look, so I looked.
L6653	u114	m6	WELLES	Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
L6652	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Okay.
L6651	u114	m6	WELLES	For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
L6650	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Do you think the film could have cost that much?
L6649	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm here.
L6648	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Hello... ?
L6647	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
L6646	u114	m6	WELLES	You're joking.
L6645	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
L6644	u114	m6	WELLES	Okay, I follow you so far...
L6643	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
L6642	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	The checks were for odd amounts...
L6641	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm not positive this means anything.
L6640	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
L6639	u114	m6	WELLES	Okay...
L6428	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
L6427	u114	m6	WELLES	Nothing remotely like this.
L6426	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	You've found missing persons before.
L6425	u114	m6	WELLES	I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
L6424	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
L6423	u114	m6	WELLES	It won't work like that.
L6422	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
L6421	u114	m6	WELLES	You don't have any other choice.
L6420	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	I told you I can't, not yet.
L6419	u114	m6	WELLES	You... you need to go to the police.
L6418	u114	m6	WELLES	Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
L6417	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Will you watch it and see for yourself?
L6416	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
L6415	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	I'm telling you it's not that.
L6414	u114	m6	WELLES	If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
L6413	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	No.
L6412	u114	m6	WELLES	Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
L6411	u114	m6	WELLES	"Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a ""snuff film.""  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you."
L6410	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
L6409	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
L6408	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm afraid I don't...
L6407	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
L6406	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Cash, stock certificates, and this...
L6405	u114	m6	WELLES	Do you want to tell me what you found?
L6404	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
L6403	u114	m6	WELLES	You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
L6402	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
L6401	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Just curious.
L6400	u114	m6	WELLES	I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
L6399	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
L6398	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
L6397	u114	m6	WELLES	He succeeded.
L6396	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
L6395	u114	m6	WELLES	Pittsburgh?
L6392	u114	m6	WELLES	I'll do whatever I can to help.
L6391	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
L6390	u114	m6	WELLES	My condolences.
L6389	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
L6388	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
L6387	u114	m6	WELLES	I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
L6386	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
L6385	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
L6384	u114	m6	WELLES	He's odd.
L6383	u114	m6	WELLES	Thank you.
L6382	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
L6373	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
L6372	u114	m6	WELLES	Uh huh, pleasure.
L6369	u114	m6	WELLES	I try to be.
L6368	u109	m6	MRS CHRISTIAN	Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
L7098	u114	m6	WELLES	They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
L7097	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
L7096	u114	m6	WELLES	They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
L7095	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	No... no... no...
L7094	u114	m6	WELLES	He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
L7093	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	No...
L7092	u114	m6	WELLES	They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
L7091	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Who are you?
L7090	u114	m6	WELLES	Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
L7089	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Who is this... ?
L7088	u114	m6	WELLES	Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
L7087	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	What... ?
L7086	u114	m6	WELLES	She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
L7085	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	What are you talking about... ?
L7084	u114	m6	WELLES	I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
L7083	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	I remember.  You just left...
L7082	u114	m6	WELLES	Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
L7081	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Hello... ?
L6536	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
L6535	u114	m6	WELLES	It's been six years.
L6534	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
L6532	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Yes.
L6531	u114	m6	WELLES	You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
L6528	u114	m6	WELLES	You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
L6527	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
L6526	u114	m6	WELLES	Will you let me look?
L6525	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	How... how can you say that to me...?
L6524	u114	m6	WELLES	If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
L6523	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
L6522	u114	m6	WELLES	It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
L6521	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	I don't know.  I think so.
L6520	u114	m6	WELLES	Do you think the police did a good job?
L6519	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	There wasn't one.  The police looked.
L6518	u114	m6	WELLES	It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
L6517	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	What?
L6516	u114	m6	WELLES	I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
L6515	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	You should be.
L6514	u114	m6	WELLES	No.
L6513	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Are you religious?
L6512	u114	m6	WELLES	We're all like that.
L6511	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
L6508	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Okay.
L6507	u114	m6	WELLES	I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
L6504	u114	m6	WELLES	Of course.
L6503	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
L6502	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
L6501	u114	m6	WELLES	I had to ask.  I apologize.
L6500	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
L6499	u114	m6	WELLES	I didn't mean to...
L6498	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
L6497	u114	m6	WELLES	You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
L6496	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	It got to be too much for him.
L6495	u114	m6	WELLES	Why do you think he did it?
L6494	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
L6493	u114	m6	WELLES	September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
L6492	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Yes.
L6491	u114	m6	WELLES	If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
L6490	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	I don't know.
L6489	u114	m6	WELLES	What was she running from?
L6488	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
L6487	u114	m6	WELLES	She just seemed... depressed... ?
L6486	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	No.
L6485	u114	m6	WELLES	So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
L6483	u114	m6	WELLES	You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
L6482	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
L6481	u114	m6	WELLES	That's exactly what I am.
L6480	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
L6479	u114	m6	WELLES	It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
L6477	u114	m6	WELLES	Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
L6476	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	No.
L6475	u114	m6	WELLES	Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
L6474	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Neil... Neil Cole.
L6473	u114	m6	WELLES	What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
L6472	u114	m6	WELLES	These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
L6471	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Yes, but...
L6470	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
L6469	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	I don't understand, who are... ?
L6468	u114	m6	WELLES	I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
L6467	u114	m6	WELLES	Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
L6466	u110	m6	MRS MATHEWS	Yes... ?
L6671	u114	m6	WELLES	I'll do what I can.
L6670	u111	m6	NUN	She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
L6669	u114	m6	WELLES	Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
L6668	u111	m6	NUN	That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
L6667	u114	m6	WELLES	Her belongings?
L6666	u111	m6	NUN	Those are her belongings.
L6665	u114	m6	WELLES	What is this?
L6662	u114	m6	WELLES	I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
L6661	u111	m6	NUN	Do you know what happened to her?
L6659	u111	m6	NUN	Yes.  I remember her.
L6658	u114	m6	WELLES	You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
L6657	u111	m6	NUN	Yes... I remember Mary
L6360	u114	m6	WELLES	Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
L6359	u112	m6	POLITICIAN	Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
L6358	u114	m6	WELLES	The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
L6357	u112	m6	POLITICIAN	He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
L6356	u114	m6	WELLES	No, sir, he is not.
L6355	u112	m6	POLITICIAN	None too discreet, is he?
L6354	u114	m6	WELLES	Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
L6684	u113	m6	SALESPERSON	Certainly, sir.
L6683	u114	m6	WELLES	Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
L6682	u113	m6	SALESPERSON	I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
L6681	u113	m6	SALESPERSON	Okay.  Fine.
L6680	u114	m6	WELLES	No, you may not.
L6679	u113	m6	SALESPERSON	Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
L6678	u114	m6	WELLES	Cash.
L6677	u113	m6	SALESPERSON	Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
L6676	u114	m6	WELLES	Okay, I'll take it all.
L12762	u139	m10	ALMA	All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
L12761	u154	m10	WADE	He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
L12760	u139	m10	ALMA	No.
L12759	u154	m10	WADE	Twombley involved?
L12758	u139	m10	ALMA	I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
L12757	u154	m10	WADE	What is the Northcountry Development Association?
L12756	u139	m10	ALMA	This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
L12754	u154	m10	WADE	As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
L12753	u139	m10	ALMA	Has anybody offered to buy it?
L12752	u154	m10	WADE	I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
L12751	u139	m10	ALMA	About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
L12750	u154	m10	WADE	You don't believe me?
L12749	u139	m10	ALMA	Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
L12748	u154	m10	WADE	...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
L12747	u154	m10	WADE	You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
L12746	u139	m10	ALMA	Who?
L12745	u154	m10	WADE	Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
L12744	u139	m10	ALMA	Who?
L12743	u154	m10	WADE	This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
L12742	u139	m10	ALMA	Always has been.
L12741	u154	m10	WADE	Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
L12740	u139	m10	ALMA	Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
L12739	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
L12738	u139	m10	ALMA	Are you alright, Wade?
L12737	u154	m10	WADE	No. Black.
L12736	u139	m10	ALMA	Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
L12735	u154	m10	WADE	You got yourself a computer, Alma.
L12780	u140	m10	CHICK	He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
L12779	u154	m10	WADE	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
L12778	u140	m10	CHICK	Chub says you're fired.
L12777	u154	m10	WADE	Tell me.
L12776	u140	m10	CHICK	LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
L12775	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. I know about that.
L12774	u140	m10	CHICK	-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
L12773	u154	m10	WADE	Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
L12772	u140	m10	CHICK	The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
L12141	u140	m10	CHICK	Same old shit.
L12140	u154	m10	WADE	What are you boys up to?
L12680	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
L12679	u141	m10	HAND	You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
L12678	u154	m10	WADE	Oh.
L12677	u141	m10	HAND	Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
L12676	u154	m10	WADE	Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
L12675	u141	m10	HAND	Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
L12674	u154	m10	WADE	Yes.
L12673	u141	m10	HAND	No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
L12672	u154	m10	WADE	It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
L12671	u141	m10	HAND	Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
L12670	u154	m10	WADE	This spring.
L12669	u141	m10	HAND	How soon?
L12668	u154	m10	WADE	I plan to. Soon.
L12667	u141	m10	HAND	It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
L12666	u154	m10	WADE	I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
L12733	u142	m10	JACK	That was me.
L12732	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	We bought you.
L12731	u142	m10	JACK	You can't buy Wade off.
L12730	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
L12729	u142	m10	JACK	Shit! What are we gonna do?
L12728	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	He's on to us!
L12402	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
L12401	u142	m10	JACK	Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
L12400	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
L12399	u142	m10	JACK	Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
L12398	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
L12390	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
L12389	u142	m10	JACK	Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
L12388	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	You see it?
L12381	u142	m10	JACK	Yeah.
L12380	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	I hear Twombley got shot.
L12379	u142	m10	JACK	You heard the news.
L12300	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
L12299	u142	m10	JACK	Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
L12284	u142	m10	JACK	Deers have ears too.
L12283	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Sun's gettin high.
L12282	u142	m10	JACK	This way.
L12281	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Yeah.
L12280	u142	m10	JACK	Safety on?
L12278	u142	m10	JACK	Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
L12277	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	What happened?
L12276	u142	m10	JACK	The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
L12275	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Hmm.
L12274	u142	m10	JACK	They said.
L12273	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Really.
L12272	u142	m10	JACK	"Pitcher. ""Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."""
L12271	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Oh.
L12270	u142	m10	JACK	Double A. New Britain.
L12269	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	You played for the Sox?
L12268	u142	m10	JACK	Drafted by the Red Sox.
L12267	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Yeah?
L12266	u142	m10	JACK	I used to play ball.
L12265	u142	m10	JACK	Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
L12264	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	I'm okay.
L12254	u142	m10	JACK	Wonderful!
L12253	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
L12252	u142	m10	JACK	I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
L12251	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
L12250	u142	m10	JACK	Mmm.
L12249	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
L12248	u142	m10	JACK	You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
L12247	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	You think so.
L12246	u142	m10	JACK	You might not kill it.
L12245	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Yeah.
L12244	u142	m10	JACK	If you get it?
L12243	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
L12242	u142	m10	JACK	Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
L12241	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Damn straight!
L12240	u142	m10	JACK	Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
L12239	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	Guaranteed, eh?
L12238	u142	m10	JACK	Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
L12237	u153	m10	TWOMBLEY	It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
L12661	u142	m10	JACK	What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
L12660	u154	m10	WADE	I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
L12659	u142	m10	JACK	Open the door. We're late.
L12658	u154	m10	WADE	Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
L12657	u142	m10	JACK	Open the door, will ya?
L12656	u142	m10	JACK	Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
L12655	u154	m10	WADE	Lawford?
L12654	u142	m10	JACK	I'm fucking out of here.
L12428	u142	m10	JACK	He sure as hell won't.
L12427	u154	m10	WADE	Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
L12426	u142	m10	JACK	Yeah.
L12425	u154	m10	WADE	There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
L12424	u142	m10	JACK	Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
L12423	u154	m10	WADE	You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
L12422	u142	m10	JACK	What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
L12421	u154	m10	WADE	Saw him do it?
L12420	u142	m10	JACK	What?
L12419	u154	m10	WADE	Sure you did.
L12418	u142	m10	JACK	Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
L12417	u154	m10	WADE	I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
L12416	u142	m10	JACK	Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
L12415	u154	m10	WADE	I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
L12414	u142	m10	JACK	Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
L12413	u154	m10	WADE	On your sleeve.
L12412	u142	m10	JACK	What blood?
L12411	u154	m10	WADE	Where'd you get the blood?
L12410	u142	m10	JACK	Yeah.
L12409	u154	m10	WADE	You stayed away?
L12408	u142	m10	JACK	The ambulance guys lugged him up.
L12407	u154	m10	WADE	You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
L12406	u142	m10	JACK	A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
L12405	u154	m10	WADE	No, I mean whereabouts.
L12404	u142	m10	JACK	In the chest.
L12403	u154	m10	WADE	Where'd Twombley get shot?
L12204	u142	m10	JACK	Piece of fucking cake.
L12203	u154	m10	WADE	Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
L12198	u154	m10	WADE	Shit.
L12197	u142	m10	JACK	Bastard's got his high beams on.
L12196	u154	m10	WADE	Right!
L12195	u142	m10	JACK	Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
L12194	u154	m10	WADE	Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
L12193	u142	m10	JACK	Like you and Gordon?
L12190	u142	m10	JACK	Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
L12189	u154	m10	WADE	How'd you get the job?
L12188	u142	m10	JACK	Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
L12187	u154	m10	WADE	Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
L12186	u142	m10	JACK	Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
L12184	u154	m10	WADE	Not here.
L12183	u142	m10	JACK	Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
L12182	u154	m10	WADE	You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
L12181	u142	m10	JACK	Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
L12180	u154	m10	WADE	I thought I told you to move that truck!
L12150	u154	m10	WADE	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
L12149	u142	m10	JACK	No brag. Just fact.
L12148	u154	m10	WADE	Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
L12147	u142	m10	JACK	LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
L12146	u154	m10	WADE	Don't mind if I do.
L12835	u154	m10	WADE	Okay, let's go home, then.
L12834	u143	m10	JILL	I want to go home.
L12833	u154	m10	WADE	Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
L12830	u143	m10	JILL	Oh.
L12829	u154	m10	WADE	Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
L12828	u143	m10	JILL	You're a policeman.
L12827	u154	m10	WADE	I know.
L12826	u143	m10	JILL	That's illegal, you know.
L12825	u154	m10	WADE	You can't.
L12824	u143	m10	JILL	I want to go home.
L12823	u154	m10	WADE	I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
L12822	u143	m10	JILL	What are you sorry for?
L12821	u154	m10	WADE	Please don't cry. Please, honey.
L12819	u154	m10	WADE	Fine.
L12818	u143	m10	JILL	Okay.
L12817	u154	m10	WADE	Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
L12816	u143	m10	JILL	Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
L12815	u154	m10	WADE	I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
L12814	u143	m10	JILL	Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
L12813	u154	m10	WADE	You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
L12812	u143	m10	JILL	Nothing.
L12811	u154	m10	WADE	What do you want, then?
L12810	u143	m10	JILL	No.
L12809	u154	m10	WADE	C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
L12808	u143	m10	JILL	Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
L12807	u154	m10	WADE	How about a Big Mac?
L12806	u143	m10	JILL	Oh.
L12805	u154	m10	WADE	Grandpa. My father. It's his.
L12804	u143	m10	JILL	Pop?
L12803	u154	m10	WADE	It belongs to Pop.
L12802	u143	m10	JILL	It's pretty old.
L12801	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
L12800	u143	m10	JILL	Are we going in this?
L12598	u154	m10	WADE	I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
L12597	u143	m10	JILL	Dad.
L12179	u143	m10	JILL	That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
L12178	u154	m10	WADE	Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
L12177	u154	m10	WADE	Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
L12176	u143	m10	JILL	Yes.
L12175	u154	m10	WADE	She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
L12174	u143	m10	JILL	Yes.
L12173	u154	m10	WADE	"That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."
L12172	u143	m10	JILL	Yes.
L12171	u154	m10	WADE	She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
L12170	u154	m10	WADE	Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
L12169	u143	m10	JILL	I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
L12168	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
L12167	u143	m10	JILL	See, I knew you'd be mad.
L12166	u154	m10	WADE	Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
L12165	u143	m10	JILL	I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
L12164	u154	m10	WADE	Jesus, why?
L12163	u143	m10	JILL	Yes.
L12162	u154	m10	WADE	What? You called Mommy? Just now?
L12161	u143	m10	JILL	I called Mommy.
L12160	u154	m10	WADE	Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
L12159	u143	m10	JILL	I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
L12158	u154	m10	WADE	You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
L12157	u143	m10	JILL	No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
L12156	u154	m10	WADE	No what?
L12155	u143	m10	JILL	No.
L12154	u154	m10	WADE	Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
L12138	u154	m10	WADE	Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
L12137	u143	m10	JILL	I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
L12136	u154	m10	WADE	It's fun.
L12135	u143	m10	JILL	It's stupid.
L12134	u154	m10	WADE	What then?
L12133	u143	m10	JILL	It's not that.
L12132	u154	m10	WADE	Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
L12131	u143	m10	JILL	I don't want to.
L12130	u154	m10	WADE	Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
L12127	u143	m10	JILL	No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
L12126	u154	m10	WADE	No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
L12125	u143	m10	JILL	I just think you used to be bad.
L12124	u154	m10	WADE	What are you talking about?
L12123	u143	m10	JILL	I bet you did lots of bad things.
L12122	u154	m10	WADE	It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
L12121	u143	m10	JILL	But it's not funny now.
L12120	u154	m10	WADE	To us it was.
L12119	u143	m10	JILL	Was it funny?
L12118	u154	m10	WADE	Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
L12117	u143	m10	JILL	Did you do that when you were a kid?
L12116	u154	m10	WADE	I guess they're stupid.
L12115	u143	m10	JILL	Yeah. It's stupid.
L12114	u154	m10	WADE	Break stuff?
L12113	u143	m10	JILL	You know.
L12112	u154	m10	WADE	Do what?
L12111	u143	m10	JILL	Why do they do that?
L12110	u154	m10	WADE	Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
L12109	u143	m10	JILL	I don't care. They're out.
L12108	u154	m10	WADE	Those are the Hoyts.
L12107	u143	m10	JILL	Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
L12106	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12105	u143	m10	JILL	Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
L12104	u154	m10	WADE	I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
L12767	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
L12766	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	The key, Wade.
L12765	u154	m10	WADE	You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
L12764	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
L12703	u154	m10	WADE	Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
L12702	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Could be.
L12701	u154	m10	WADE	You and Mel Gordon?
L12700	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Maybe.
L12699	u154	m10	WADE	I won't. You interested?
L12698	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
L12697	u154	m10	WADE	Want to buy?
L12696	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
L12695	u154	m10	WADE	That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
L12694	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
L12693	u154	m10	WADE	You? Why?
L12692	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
L12691	u154	m10	WADE	He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
L12690	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	So?
L12689	u154	m10	WADE	I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
L12688	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
L12687	u154	m10	WADE	What do I have to do for it?
L12684	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
L12683	u154	m10	WADE	On what you pay me?
L12682	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
L12681	u154	m10	WADE	Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
L12576	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
L12575	u154	m10	WADE	I'm fine, fine.
L12574	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	How you holding up, Wade?
L12397	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
L12396	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. A few things.
L12395	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Something bugging you?
L12394	u154	m10	WADE	It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
L12393	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
L12378	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
L12377	u154	m10	WADE	You want me to follow them to Littleton?
L12376	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
L12375	u154	m10	WADE	Like hell.
L12374	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
L12373	u154	m10	WADE	I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
L12372	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
L12371	u154	m10	WADE	He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
L12370	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
L12369	u154	m10	WADE	You mean Twombley?
L12368	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
L12367	u154	m10	WADE	Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
L12366	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
L12365	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
L12364	u154	m10	WADE	I figured you already heard.
L12363	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Huh?
L12362	u154	m10	WADE	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
L12361	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	What's the hurry?
L12297	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
L12296	u154	m10	WADE	Fuck you.
L12295	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
L12294	u154	m10	WADE	I'm not saying that.
L12293	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	You don't want the extra police pay?
L12292	u154	m10	WADE	What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
L12291	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Don't go playing policeman.
L12290	u154	m10	WADE	At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
L12289	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Huh?
L12288	u154	m10	WADE	His son-in-law damn near killed me.
L12287	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
L12286	u154	m10	WADE	Where's the plow?
L12285	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
L12235	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
L12234	u154	m10	WADE	Tomorrow, Gordon.
L12129	u154	m10	WADE	Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
L12128	u144	m10	LARIVIERE	We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
L12798	u145	m10	LILLIAN	You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
L12797	u154	m10	WADE	Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
L12796	u145	m10	LILLIAN	You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
L12795	u154	m10	WADE	No problem. Look, I...
L12792	u154	m10	WADE	Hi honey.
L12791	u145	m10	LILLIAN	See. Get your boots.
L12790	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, lots.
L12789	u145	m10	LILLIAN	Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
L12604	u145	m10	LILLIAN	Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
L12603	u154	m10	WADE	It's just...
L12602	u145	m10	LILLIAN	We've done all our talking, Wade.
L12601	u154	m10	WADE	We should talk.
L12600	u145	m10	LILLIAN	No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
L12599	u154	m10	WADE	You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
L12218	u154	m10	WADE	I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
L12217	u145	m10	LILLIAN	Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
L12216	u154	m10	WADE	I don't want her to go, Lillian.
L12213	u154	m10	WADE	Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
L12212	u145	m10	LILLIAN	She's grown up some, hasn't she?
L12211	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12210	u145	m10	LILLIAN	While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
L12208	u145	m10	LILLIAN	Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
L12207	u154	m10	WADE	Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
L12206	u145	m10	LILLIAN	Where's Jill?
L12205	u154	m10	WADE	Lillian!
L12262	u154	m10	WADE	From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
L12261	u146	m10	LUGENE	I still don't understand --
L12260	u154	m10	WADE	Mel Gordon.
L12259	u146	m10	LUGENE	Good. Who?
L12258	u154	m10	WADE	I know who it is.
L12257	u146	m10	LUGENE	Did you get his number?
L12256	u154	m10	WADE	Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
L12255	u146	m10	LUGENE	Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
L12844	u147	m10	MARGIE	Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
L12843	u154	m10	WADE	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
L12842	u147	m10	MARGIE	I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
L12841	u154	m10	WADE	Going somewhere, Margie?
L12785	u154	m10	WADE	Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
L12784	u147	m10	MARGIE	I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
L12783	u154	m10	WADE	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
L12782	u147	m10	MARGIE	What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
L12713	u154	m10	WADE	Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
L12712	u147	m10	MARGIE	What happened?
L12582	u147	m10	MARGIE	Wade.
L12581	u154	m10	WADE	This is nuts.
L12534	u154	m10	WADE	I don't know for Christ's sake!
L12533	u147	m10	MARGIE	How?
L12532	u154	m10	WADE	Of course! I would've heard.
L12531	u147	m10	MARGIE	Think they're alright?
L12530	u154	m10	WADE	Strange.
L12529	u154	m10	WADE	The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
L12528	u147	m10	MARGIE	Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
L12527	u154	m10	WADE	I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
L12526	u147	m10	MARGIE	I know your parents.
L12525	u154	m10	WADE	Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
L12524	u147	m10	MARGIE	Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
L12516	u154	m10	WADE	Good.
L12515	u147	m10	MARGIE	Alright. I'll think about it.
L12514	u154	m10	WADE	It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
L12513	u147	m10	MARGIE	You've been married twice --
L12512	u154	m10	WADE	I've been thinking about it, that's all.
L12511	u147	m10	MARGIE	Oh, Wade.
L12510	u154	m10	WADE	There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
L12509	u147	m10	MARGIE	Then... I guess you have to.
L12508	u154	m10	WADE	I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
L12507	u147	m10	MARGIE	Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
L12506	u147	m10	MARGIE	It's nice.
L12505	u154	m10	WADE	After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
L12504	u147	m10	MARGIE	What way?
L12503	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
L12502	u147	m10	MARGIE	You knew me as a kid.
L12501	u154	m10	WADE	I can see what you looked like as a kid.
L12499	u147	m10	MARGIE	But not now.
L12498	u154	m10	WADE	No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
L12497	u147	m10	MARGIE	You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
L12496	u154	m10	WADE	No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
L12495	u147	m10	MARGIE	The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
L12494	u154	m10	WADE	Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
L12493	u147	m10	MARGIE	Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
L12492	u154	m10	WADE	Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
L12491	u147	m10	MARGIE	Jack doesn't need money.
L12490	u154	m10	WADE	Money.
L12489	u147	m10	MARGIE	Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
L12488	u154	m10	WADE	I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
L12487	u147	m10	MARGIE	...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
L12486	u154	m10	WADE	I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
L12485	u147	m10	MARGIE	I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
L12484	u154	m10	WADE	There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
L12483	u147	m10	MARGIE	Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
L12350	u147	m10	MARGIE	Okay.
L12349	u154	m10	WADE	Tonight. Let's get together.
L12348	u147	m10	MARGIE	Call me.
L12344	u154	m10	WADE	The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
L12343	u147	m10	MARGIE	No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
L12342	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. I mean that.
L12341	u147	m10	MARGIE	You don't mean that.
L12340	u154	m10	WADE	I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
L12339	u147	m10	MARGIE	I'm sorry.
L12338	u154	m10	WADE	Forget it.
L12337	u147	m10	MARGIE	About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
L12336	u154	m10	WADE	Said what?
L12335	u147	m10	MARGIE	I'm sorry about what I said.
L12334	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12333	u147	m10	MARGIE	You okay?
L12233	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12232	u147	m10	MARGIE	You okay?
L12231	u154	m10	WADE	See you tomorrow, maybe.
L12230	u147	m10	MARGIE	Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
L12225	u147	m10	MARGIE	You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
L12224	u154	m10	WADE	Okay. She's fine.
L12223	u147	m10	MARGIE	How's she doing?
L12222	u154	m10	WADE	For a while.
L12221	u147	m10	MARGIE	New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
L12564	u151	m10	POP	Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
L12563	u147	m10	MARGIE	Can --?
L12562	u151	m10	POP	It makes me sad.
L12555	u151	m10	POP	Is...? She's dead then?
L12554	u147	m10	MARGIE	When did she die?
L12553	u151	m10	POP	Coffee's perked.
L12550	u147	m10	MARGIE	Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
L12549	u151	m10	POP	It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
L12548	u147	m10	MARGIE	You're not using it today?
L12547	u151	m10	POP	There's a furnace.
L12546	u147	m10	MARGIE	Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
L12482	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
L12481	u154	m10	WADE	Yes. Here's your ticket.
L12480	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
L12479	u154	m10	WADE	Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
L12478	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
L12477	u154	m10	WADE	Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
L12476	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	Hold on!
L12475	u154	m10	WADE	Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
L12474	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
L12473	u154	m10	WADE	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
L12472	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	What the hell are you talking about?
L12471	u154	m10	WADE	Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
L12470	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
L12469	u154	m10	WADE	How's that?
L12468	u148	m10	MEL GORDON	Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
L12467	u149	m10	MRS. GORDON	Can't it wait, then?
L12466	u154	m10	WADE	Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
L12465	u149	m10	MRS. GORDON	Something about my father?
L12464	u154	m10	WADE	Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
L12463	u149	m10	MRS. GORDON	Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
L12462	u154	m10	WADE	Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
L12461	u149	m10	MRS. GORDON	He's asleep. We were up very late.
L12460	u154	m10	WADE	I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
L12459	u149	m10	MRS. GORDON	Who are you?
L12840	u150	m10	NICK	No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
L12839	u154	m10	WADE	He got his deer yet?
L12838	u150	m10	NICK	Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
L12837	u154	m10	WADE	His office. You mean my old office.
L12836	u150	m10	NICK	Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
L12832	u150	m10	NICK	It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
L12831	u154	m10	WADE	Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
L12358	u154	m10	WADE	No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
L12357	u150	m10	NICK	CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
L12356	u154	m10	WADE	Where... how'd you hear that?
L12355	u150	m10	NICK	The other guy.
L12354	u154	m10	WADE	Jack?
L12353	u150	m10	NICK	The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
L12352	u154	m10	WADE	Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
L12351	u150	m10	NICK	You talked to Jack?
L12347	u150	m10	NICK	Marg! You got orders!
L12346	u154	m10	WADE	That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
L12345	u150	m10	NICK	Marg!
L12331	u154	m10	WADE	"Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with ""Home Made Cooking"", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong."
L12330	u150	m10	NICK	This town sucks.
L12329	u154	m10	WADE	I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
L12328	u150	m10	NICK	Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
L12327	u154	m10	WADE	The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
L12326	u150	m10	NICK	What?
L12325	u154	m10	WADE	It don't look right.
L12229	u154	m10	WADE	You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
L12228	u150	m10	NICK	Take care, Wade.
L12864	u154	m10	WADE	I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
L12863	u151	m10	POP	Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
L12862	u154	m10	WADE	Crawl!
L12861	u151	m10	POP	Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
L12860	u154	m10	WADE	You and me.
L12859	u151	m10	POP	Bang!
L12858	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12857	u151	m10	POP	Everything you know is from me.
L12856	u154	m10	WADE	Call it what you want.
L12855	u151	m10	POP	Love! I'm made of love!
L12854	u154	m10	WADE	Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
L12853	u151	m10	POP	Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
L12852	u154	m10	WADE	You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
L12851	u151	m10	POP	You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
L12719	u151	m10	POP	You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
L12718	u154	m10	WADE	Pop, for Christ's sake!
L12590	u151	m10	POP	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
L12589	u154	m10	WADE	Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
L12561	u151	m10	POP	Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
L12560	u154	m10	WADE	Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
L12559	u151	m10	POP	In the living room.
L12558	u154	m10	WADE	Is there something wrong with the phone?
L12557	u151	m10	POP	I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
L12556	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12545	u151	m10	POP	She's coming.
L12544	u154	m10	WADE	Where's Ma?
L12542	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12541	u151	m10	POP	We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
L12540	u154	m10	WADE	How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
L12539	u151	m10	POP	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
L12538	u154	m10	WADE	You remember Margie Fogg?
L12537	u151	m10	POP	Sleeping.
L12536	u154	m10	WADE	Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
L12324	u151	m10	POP	You no-good pup!
L12323	u154	m10	WADE	Nothing.
L12322	u151	m10	POP	What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
L12312	u151	m10	POP	Atta-go.
L12311	u154	m10	WADE	Just do it.
L12310	u151	m10	POP	A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
L12309	u154	m10	WADE	Rolfe.
L12771	u152	m10	ROLFE	Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
L12770	u154	m10	WADE	To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
L12769	u152	m10	ROLFE	For what?
L12768	u154	m10	WADE	I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
L12727	u154	m10	WADE	But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
L12726	u152	m10	ROLFE	Wade, are you alright?
L12725	u154	m10	WADE	Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
L12649	u154	m10	WADE	That's what you think.
L12648	u152	m10	ROLFE	I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
L12647	u154	m10	WADE	Well, I never heard that one.
L12646	u152	m10	ROLFE	And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
L12645	u154	m10	WADE	We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
L12644	u152	m10	ROLFE	It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
L12643	u154	m10	WADE	You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
L12642	u152	m10	ROLFE	It may have happened, but not the way you said.
L12641	u154	m10	WADE	Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
L12640	u152	m10	ROLFE	I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
L12639	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah.
L12638	u152	m10	ROLFE	I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
L12637	u152	m10	ROLFE	I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
L12636	u154	m10	WADE	Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
L12635	u152	m10	ROLFE	Not particularly.
L12634	u154	m10	WADE	It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
L12633	u154	m10	WADE	Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
L12632	u152	m10	ROLFE	A hunting accident is perfect.
L12631	u154	m10	WADE	So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
L12630	u152	m10	ROLFE	Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
L12629	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
L12628	u152	m10	ROLFE	Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
L12627	u154	m10	WADE	I don't know. You tell me.
L12626	u152	m10	ROLFE	They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
L12625	u154	m10	WADE	Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
L12624	u152	m10	ROLFE	Money.
L12623	u154	m10	WADE	Motive. You gotta have a motive.
L12622	u152	m10	ROLFE	Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
L12621	u154	m10	WADE	Then who shot him?
L12620	u152	m10	ROLFE	That it wasn't an accident.
L12619	u154	m10	WADE	Which is?
L12618	u152	m10	ROLFE	I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
L12617	u154	m10	WADE	Find them everywhere. 
L12616	u152	m10	ROLFE	Want to know what I think happened?
L12615	u154	m10	WADE	I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
L12614	u152	m10	ROLFE	Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
L12613	u154	m10	WADE	I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
L12612	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
L12611	u152	m10	ROLFE	Well, do you still plan to get married?
L12610	u154	m10	WADE	What about her?
L12609	u152	m10	ROLFE	What about Margie?
L12573	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah. I forgot.
L12572	u152	m10	ROLFE	No thanks. I don't drink.
L12571	u154	m10	WADE	Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
L12569	u152	m10	ROLFE	What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
L12568	u154	m10	WADE	Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
L12458	u154	m10	WADE	No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
L12457	u152	m10	ROLFE	Haven't you already done a bit of that?
L12456	u154	m10	WADE	I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
L12455	u152	m10	ROLFE	Get some sleep.
L12454	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, I guess.
L12453	u152	m10	ROLFE	Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
L12452	u154	m10	WADE	A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
L12451	u152	m10	ROLFE	What happened?
L12450	u154	m10	WADE	Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
L12449	u152	m10	ROLFE	Who?
L12448	u154	m10	WADE	Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
L12447	u152	m10	ROLFE	How was she?
L12446	u154	m10	WADE	The night before the shooting.
L12445	u152	m10	ROLFE	Huh?
L12444	u154	m10	WADE	Lillian was here. In Lawford.
L12443	u152	m10	ROLFE	They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
L12442	u154	m10	WADE	Well, it was an accident.
L12441	u152	m10	ROLFE	You think Jack shot him?
L12440	u154	m10	WADE	No shit.
L12439	u152	m10	ROLFE	Twombley.
L12438	u154	m10	WADE	Who?
L12437	u152	m10	ROLFE	He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
L12436	u154	m10	WADE	It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
L12435	u154	m10	WADE	No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
L12434	u152	m10	ROLFE	Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
L12433	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
L12432	u152	m10	ROLFE	There was something. It happened up your way.
L12431	u154	m10	WADE	Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
L12430	u152	m10	ROLFE	Wade?
L12429	u154	m10	WADE	Rolfe.
L60866	u411	m25	AXE	Stevie... I...
L60865	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
L60859	u421	m25	STEPHEN	There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
L60858	u411	m25	AXE	...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
L60851	u411	m25	AXE	-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
L60850	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- Knock it off!
L60844	u411	m25	AXE	They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
L60843	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
L60842	u411	m25	AXE	Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
L60609	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
L60608	u411	m25	AXE	Let me take the lead, Stephen...
L60607	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
L60606	u411	m25	AXE	It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
L60605	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
L60336	u421	m25	STEPHEN	We're gonna be okay, man...
L60335	u411	m25	AXE	Biggest in two battalions.
L60334	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
L60333	u411	m25	AXE	Yeah...
L60332	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You know Knowlton pretty well?
L60303	u421	m25	STEPHEN	No.  I need a drink.
L60302	u411	m25	AXE	Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
L60209	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
L60208	u411	m25	AXE	That's Franny. She likes firemen.
L60134	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
L60133	u411	m25	AXE	It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
L60132	u421	m25	STEPHEN	No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
L60131	u411	m25	AXE	Wash it to the windows?
L60126	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Be gentle.
L60125	u411	m25	AXE	Oh these moments do try me...
L60855	u411	m25	AXE	-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
L60854	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
L60853	u411	m25	AXE	-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
L60852	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- He killed people --
L60849	u411	m25	AXE	-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
L60848	u412	m25	BRIAN	Just come down, John. Just --
L60847	u411	m25	AXE	You gotta let me finish --
L60846	u411	m25	AXE	That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
L60845	u412	m25	BRIAN	Did you do it for Tim?
L60622	u411	m25	AXE	He's alive.
L60621	u412	m25	BRIAN	Is he...
L60183	u412	m25	BRIAN	John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
L60182	u411	m25	AXE	Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
L60181	u412	m25	BRIAN	My Lt. might have something to say about that.
L60180	u411	m25	AXE	Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
L60881	u412	m25	BRIAN	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
L60880	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
L60864	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
L60863	u412	m25	BRIAN	You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --
L60862	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
L60857	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Shut up!
L60856	u412	m25	BRIAN	You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
L60836	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
L60835	u412	m25	BRIAN	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
L60834	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I'll handle it.
L60833	u412	m25	BRIAN	What are we going to do about this?
L60832	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Anything else?
L60827	u421	m25	STEPHEN	They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
L60826	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- What were they doing there?
L60825	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
L60824	u412	m25	BRIAN	How do you know?
L60823	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I know.
L60822	u412	m25	BRIAN	I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
L60821	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- What are you doing here?
L60820	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
L60819	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
L60818	u412	m25	BRIAN	Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
L60817	u412	m25	BRIAN	Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
L60816	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
L60815	u412	m25	BRIAN	I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
L60814	u421	m25	STEPHEN	...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
L60813	u412	m25	BRIAN	I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
L60812	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Everybody did.
L60811	u412	m25	BRIAN	When dad died, I saw another fire...
L60810	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Saw what?
L60809	u412	m25	BRIAN	I saw it.
L60808	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
L60807	u412	m25	BRIAN	It's okay, Stephen, I --
L60806	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
L60805	u412	m25	BRIAN	Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
L60804	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
L60803	u412	m25	BRIAN	I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
L60802	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
L60801	u412	m25	BRIAN	You're selling dad's boat?
L60800	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
L60799	u421	m25	STEPHEN	So hello.
L60798	u412	m25	BRIAN	Just... Just wanted to say hello...
L60797	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Hey, what are you doing here?
L60632	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Fuck you.
L60631	u412	m25	BRIAN	He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
L60630	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I had that fire. He didn't listen!
L60629	u412	m25	BRIAN	Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
L60628	u421	m25	STEPHEN	...Not now, Brian.
L60468	u412	m25	BRIAN	Just leave me alone, okay?
L60467	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Brian, look --
L60466	u412	m25	BRIAN	Thanks for the insight.
L60465	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
L60369	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
L60368	u412	m25	BRIAN	Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
L60367	u421	m25	STEPHEN	That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
L60366	u412	m25	BRIAN	I waited... I would have fucking waited...
L60365	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You okay?
L60362	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
L60361	u412	m25	BRIAN	Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
L60360	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Ready?
L60354	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Roll the hose.
L60353	u412	m25	BRIAN	No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
L60352	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You got a problem with drilling, probie?
L60351	u412	m25	BRIAN	What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
L60349	u412	m25	BRIAN	What, are you kidding? By myself?
L60348	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Roll the hose.
L60317	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Yeah... too bright...
L60316	u412	m25	BRIAN	This?
L60315	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
L60311	u412	m25	BRIAN	C'mon, let's crawl home.
L60310	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
L60308	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
L60307	u412	m25	BRIAN	So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
L60235	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hey.
L60234	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Hey.
L60233	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
L60232	u412	m25	BRIAN	Thanks.
L60185	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- Never mind.
L60184	u421	m25	STEPHEN	C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
L60170	u421	m25	STEPHEN	What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
L60169	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
L60168	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- I told you to stay next to me!
L60167	u412	m25	BRIAN	Goddamn it Stephen!
L60166	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
L60165	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- C'mon, Stephen.
L60164	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
L60138	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
L60137	u412	m25	BRIAN	I'm in heaven, Lt.
L60136	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Ya love it, probie?
L60114	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
L60113	u412	m25	BRIAN	I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
L60112	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
L60111	u412	m25	BRIAN	Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
L60110	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Thanks for the speakers.
L60109	u412	m25	BRIAN	There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
L60108	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
L60107	u412	m25	BRIAN	So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
L60106	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
L60105	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hey! You don't know me --
L60104	u421	m25	STEPHEN	What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
L60103	u412	m25	BRIAN	"I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"
L60102	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Why'd you come here, Brian?
L60101	u421	m25	STEPHEN	That was never proved.
L60100	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah? What about Laura --
L60099	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Sheep don't count.
L60098	u412	m25	BRIAN	Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
L60097	u421	m25	STEPHEN	People actually used to pay you for this?
L60096	u412	m25	BRIAN	It worked when you were in sixth grade.
L60095	u421	m25	STEPHEN	It works.
L60094	u412	m25	BRIAN	In the Field Museum once.
L60093	u421	m25	STEPHEN	What, you've never seen one before?
L60092	u412	m25	BRIAN	My God, an actual operating 8-track.
L60090	u421	m25	STEPHEN	It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
L60089	u412	m25	BRIAN	Been ripping off fire stations?
L60088	u421	m25	STEPHEN	It's comin' along... want a beer?
L60087	u412	m25	BRIAN	I like what you've done with the place.
L60054	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
L60053	u412	m25	BRIAN	Not likely.
L60052	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
L60051	u421	m25	STEPHEN	So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
L60050	u412	m25	BRIAN	I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
L60049	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
L59962	u421	m25	STEPHEN	If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
L59961	u412	m25	BRIAN	Who asked you?
L59960	u421	m25	STEPHEN	It doesn't go like that.
L60908	u417	m25	JENNIFER	It's a small town.
L60907	u412	m25	BRIAN	I'll see ya around, huh?
L60906	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I don't have the slightest idea...
L60905	u412	m25	BRIAN	What'll you do?
L60904	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I quit two days ago, Brian.
L60903	u412	m25	BRIAN	I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
L60746	u412	m25	BRIAN	You're right.
L60745	u417	m25	JENNIFER	That's a dumb thing to say.
L60744	u412	m25	BRIAN	I'm sorry.
L60743	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Just take it.
L60742	u412	m25	BRIAN	What is --
L60720	u412	m25	BRIAN	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
L60719	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
L60718	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yes.
L60717	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Do you know what you're asking me to do?
L60716	u412	m25	BRIAN	You could check. It'd be in his files.
L60715	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I don't know anything about it.
L60714	u412	m25	BRIAN	Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
L60713	u417	m25	JENNIFER	We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
L60712	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hi.
L60711	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Hi.
L60647	u417	m25	JENNIFER	You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
L60646	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- I work for the city.
L60645	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
L60644	u412	m25	BRIAN	Leave Stephen out of this --
L60643	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
L60642	u412	m25	BRIAN	"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"
L60641	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I was doing my job.
L60640	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
L60639	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
L60638	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
L60637	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
L60636	u412	m25	BRIAN	You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
L60635	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Brian. What's wrong?
L60591	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Uh huh.
L60590	u412	m25	BRIAN	Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
L60587	u412	m25	BRIAN	I wanted to be a good one.
L60586	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Then why did you quit?
L60585	u412	m25	BRIAN	When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
L60584	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
L60583	u412	m25	BRIAN	See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
L60582	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Homey.
L60581	u412	m25	BRIAN	This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
L60580	u412	m25	BRIAN	Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
L60579	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Got anything to drink in there?
L60578	u412	m25	BRIAN	Thanks for the invite.
L60576	u412	m25	BRIAN	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
L60575	u417	m25	JENNIFER	But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
L60574	u412	m25	BRIAN	Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
L60573	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
L60572	u412	m25	BRIAN	No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
L60571	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
L60570	u412	m25	BRIAN	Okay.
L60564	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
L60563	u412	m25	BRIAN	Well, you did invite me here.
L60562	u417	m25	JENNIFER	You think that's really any of your business?
L60561	u412	m25	BRIAN	Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
L60560	u417	m25	JENNIFER	If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
L60559	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
L60558	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Hi.
L60542	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
L60541	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I could use a date.
L60540	u412	m25	BRIAN	I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
L60539	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
L60538	u412	m25	BRIAN	Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
L60537	u417	m25	JENNIFER	How's it going?
L60536	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hey.
L60535	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
L60534	u412	m25	BRIAN	Arson.
L60377	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah...
L60376	u417	m25	JENNIFER	...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
L60375	u412	m25	BRIAN	I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
L60284	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
L60283	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
L60282	u412	m25	BRIAN	So now you suddenly care about my future?
L60281	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
L60280	u412	m25	BRIAN	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
L60279	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
L60252	u412	m25	BRIAN	I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
L60251	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
L60250	u412	m25	BRIAN	What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
L60247	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
L60246	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
L60245	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
L60244	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
L60243	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
L60242	u412	m25	BRIAN	Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
L60241	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
L60240	u412	m25	BRIAN	Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
L60239	u417	m25	JENNIFER	When I was twenty.
L60238	u412	m25	BRIAN	With grenadine, right?
L60040	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
L60039	u412	m25	BRIAN	Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
L60035	u417	m25	JENNIFER	What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
L60034	u412	m25	BRIAN	Really? No kidding.
L60033	u417	m25	JENNIFER	I work for city hall.
L60032	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah? What have you been up to?
L60031	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
L60030	u412	m25	BRIAN	So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
L60029	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Huh.
L60028	u412	m25	BRIAN	Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
L60027	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Thanks for calling.
L60026	u412	m25	BRIAN	You look great.
L60025	u417	m25	JENNIFER	You're back.
L60024	u412	m25	BRIAN	Jennifer.
L60023	u417	m25	JENNIFER	Brian.
L60795	u419	m25	RONALD	Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
L60794	u412	m25	BRIAN	Oh Jesus Christ...
L60790	u419	m25	RONALD	After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
L60789	u412	m25	BRIAN	Who the fuck is doing this?
L60788	u419	m25	RONALD	Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
L60787	u412	m25	BRIAN	Trychticholorate.
L60786	u419	m25	RONALD	That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
L60785	u412	m25	BRIAN	The outlets.
L60784	u419	m25	RONALD	Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
L60783	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
L60782	u419	m25	RONALD	Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
L60781	u412	m25	BRIAN	I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
L60780	u419	m25	RONALD	You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
L60779	u412	m25	BRIAN	What?
L60778	u419	m25	RONALD	Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
L60777	u419	m25	RONALD	Sure you do.
L60776	u412	m25	BRIAN	I don't have a story.
L60775	u419	m25	RONALD	-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
L60774	u412	m25	BRIAN	Then who --
L60773	u419	m25	RONALD	Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
L60772	u412	m25	BRIAN	Who's doing this?
L60771	u419	m25	RONALD	Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
L60770	u419	m25	RONALD	So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
L60769	u412	m25	BRIAN	I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
L60398	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hey, do I know you?
L60397	u419	m25	RONALD	Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
L59997	u412	m25	BRIAN	See you Monday. Sir.
L59996	u413	m25	CHIEF FITZGERALD	Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
L59995	u412	m25	BRIAN	No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
L59994	u413	m25	CHIEF FITZGERALD	Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
L59993	u412	m25	BRIAN	I need another one, sir.
L59992	u413	m25	CHIEF FITZGERALD	-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
L59991	u412	m25	BRIAN	If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
L59990	u413	m25	CHIEF FITZGERALD	Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
L59989	u412	m25	BRIAN	I want another shot, Sir.
L59988	u413	m25	CHIEF FITZGERALD	You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
L59987	u412	m25	BRIAN	If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
L60893	u412	m25	BRIAN	Like it never happened...
L60892	u420	m25	SHADOW	Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
L60891	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah.
L60890	u420	m25	SHADOW	Your brother was a good man.
L60767	u420	m25	SHADOW	I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
L60766	u412	m25	BRIAN	So what do you want me to do?
L60765	u420	m25	SHADOW	I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
L60764	u412	m25	BRIAN	Just wondering.
L60763	u420	m25	SHADOW	No.
L60762	u412	m25	BRIAN	Did I say thanks?
L60761	u420	m25	SHADOW	Yeah.
L60760	u412	m25	BRIAN	Did you pull me out?
L60759	u412	m25	BRIAN	How ya feeling?
L60758	u420	m25	SHADOW	Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
L60754	u420	m25	SHADOW	It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
L60753	u412	m25	BRIAN	Then who wrote the report?
L60752	u420	m25	SHADOW	Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
L60751	u412	m25	BRIAN	I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
L60750	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah? Airtight?
L60749	u420	m25	SHADOW	This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
L60709	u420	m25	SHADOW	Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
L60708	u412	m25	BRIAN	Nice bunch of guys.
L60707	u420	m25	SHADOW	And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
L60706	u412	m25	BRIAN	So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
L60705	u420	m25	SHADOW	Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
L60704	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
L60672	u412	m25	BRIAN	Fire.
L60671	u420	m25	SHADOW	In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
L60665	u412	m25	BRIAN	I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
L60664	u420	m25	SHADOW	What the hell are you doing here?
L60557	u420	m25	SHADOW	No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
L60556	u412	m25	BRIAN	Are you going public with this?
L60555	u420	m25	SHADOW	No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
L60554	u412	m25	BRIAN	That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
L60553	u420	m25	SHADOW	Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
L60552	u412	m25	BRIAN	What reason?
L60551	u420	m25	SHADOW	But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
L60550	u412	m25	BRIAN	But he killed these guys.
L60549	u420	m25	SHADOW	I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
L60548	u412	m25	BRIAN	What?
L60547	u420	m25	SHADOW	That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
L60533	u420	m25	SHADOW	I don't work for them, either.
L60532	u412	m25	BRIAN	Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
L60531	u420	m25	SHADOW	I don't guess.
L60530	u412	m25	BRIAN	But the right guess on this is arson.
L60529	u420	m25	SHADOW	Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
L60528	u412	m25	BRIAN	And the putty around the door?
L60527	u420	m25	SHADOW	Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
L60526	u412	m25	BRIAN	Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
L60525	u420	m25	SHADOW	Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
L60524	u420	m25	SHADOW	Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
L60523	u412	m25	BRIAN	During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium.
L60522	u420	m25	SHADOW	-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
L60521	u412	m25	BRIAN	Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --
L60520	u420	m25	SHADOW	Read.
L60512	u420	m25	SHADOW	I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
L60511	u412	m25	BRIAN	Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
L60445	u412	m25	BRIAN	No it couldn't.
L60444	u420	m25	SHADOW	Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
L60441	u412	m25	BRIAN	-- Another backdraft.
L60440	u420	m25	SHADOW	Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
L60439	u420	m25	SHADOW	Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
L60438	u412	m25	BRIAN	Glass?
L60437	u420	m25	SHADOW	So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
L60434	u412	m25	BRIAN	What are you listening to?
L60433	u420	m25	SHADOW	-- Shhh.
L60388	u420	m25	SHADOW	Pest control.
L60387	u412	m25	BRIAN	Where are you going?
L60386	u420	m25	SHADOW	Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
L60385	u412	m25	BRIAN	I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
L60384	u420	m25	SHADOW	Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
L60383	u412	m25	BRIAN	Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
L60382	u420	m25	SHADOW	Are you still here?
L60381	u420	m25	SHADOW	Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
L60380	u412	m25	BRIAN	Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
L60083	u416	m25	HELEN	You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
L60082	u412	m25	BRIAN	Oh, man, I'm sorry.
L60081	u416	m25	HELEN	Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
L60080	u412	m25	BRIAN	Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
L60078	u416	m25	HELEN	Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
L60077	u412	m25	BRIAN	Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
L60076	u416	m25	HELEN	Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
L60075	u412	m25	BRIAN	That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
L60073	u412	m25	BRIAN	I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
L60072	u416	m25	HELEN	Four months?
L60071	u412	m25	BRIAN	Four months.
L60070	u416	m25	HELEN	'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
L60069	u416	m25	HELEN	You look like... Brian.
L60068	u412	m25	BRIAN	Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
L60067	u416	m25	HELEN	Brian?
L60649	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
L60648	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
L60567	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
L60566	u412	m25	BRIAN	Nice boat.
L60565	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Mr. McCaffrey...
L60277	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
L60276	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
L60275	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
L60274	u412	m25	BRIAN	I have a job.
L60273	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
L60272	u412	m25	BRIAN	Every little boy's fantasy.
L60271	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
L60270	u412	m25	BRIAN	No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
L60269	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	No need to be modest, Brian.
L60268	u412	m25	BRIAN	Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
L60267	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
L60266	u412	m25	BRIAN	Yeah. Big fan.
L60454	u412	m25	BRIAN	Swayzak's not my boss.
L60453	u423	m25	TIM	There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
L60452	u412	m25	BRIAN	So, you surviving without me?
L60260	u423	m25	TIM	Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death...
L60259	u412	m25	BRIAN	What?
L60215	u412	m25	BRIAN	Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
L60214	u423	m25	TIM	"Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? ""You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it""."
L60213	u423	m25	TIM	Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
L60212	u412	m25	BRIAN	Do you have to do that?
L60048	u412	m25	BRIAN	Backdraft.
L60047	u423	m25	TIM	Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
L60020	u423	m25	TIM	Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
L60019	u412	m25	BRIAN	Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
L60018	u423	m25	TIM	You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
L60017	u412	m25	BRIAN	Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
L60016	u423	m25	TIM	How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
L60015	u412	m25	BRIAN	Engine 115, right?
L60014	u423	m25	TIM	Aren't you even curious?
L60000	u423	m25	TIM	What the hell are we waiting for?
L59999	u412	m25	BRIAN	Completely out of control.
L60013	u424	m25	WILLY	"You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for ""Brian McCaffrey, Fireman""..."
L60012	u412	m25	BRIAN	I was ahead of my time.
L60011	u424	m25	WILLY	"And just this year, ""Brian's Sound Spectrum"". Your own company even. Big step."
L60010	u412	m25	BRIAN	Coffee sucked.
L60009	u424	m25	WILLY	Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards?
L60008	u412	m25	BRIAN	Management were pin heads.
L60007	u424	m25	WILLY	"Uh huh. And ""Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins"". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?"
L60006	u412	m25	BRIAN	Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
L60005	u424	m25	WILLY	"Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was ""in your blood"". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... ""Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."""
L60004	u412	m25	BRIAN	It's in my blood, Willy.
L60003	u424	m25	WILLY	Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
L59979	u414	m25	DENNIS	You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
L59978	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Dad!
L59973	u414	m25	DENNIS	Cute.
L59972	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Firehouse.
L59971	u414	m25	DENNIS	Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
L59970	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Fireman shit?
L59967	u421	m25	STEPHEN	And DIE!
L59966	u414	m25	DENNIS	Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
L59965	u414	m25	DENNIS	Well, let's have a look.
L59964	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
L59963	u414	m25	DENNIS	Who's going to die?
L60831	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I'll be there, goddamn it!
L60830	u415	m25	GRINDLE	They're waitin' man.
L60829	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I'll be there.
L60828	u415	m25	GRINDLE	We gotta roll, Stevie...
L60692	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
L60691	u415	m25	GRINDLE	He just wants to --
L60690	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I'm busy.
L60689	u415	m25	GRINDLE	Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
L60124	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
L60123	u415	m25	GRINDLE	I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
L60730	u416	m25	HELEN	I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
L60729	u421	m25	STEPHEN	-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
L60728	u416	m25	HELEN	-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
L60727	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Look, I'm sorry I --
L60726	u416	m25	HELEN	Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
L60725	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
L60724	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
L60723	u416	m25	HELEN	What's wrong?
L60722	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
L60499	u416	m25	HELEN	You can't keep being his father...
L60498	u421	m25	STEPHEN	In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
L60497	u416	m25	HELEN	Yeah? When was the last time?
L60496	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
L60495	u416	m25	HELEN	Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
L60494	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
L60493	u416	m25	HELEN	I know he's out, but how's he doing?
L60492	u421	m25	STEPHEN	He's out.
L60491	u416	m25	HELEN	What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
L60490	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
L60489	u416	m25	HELEN	You want some coffee?
L60488	u416	m25	HELEN	You treated me like shit.
L60487	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I treated you better.
L60486	u416	m25	HELEN	Okay.
L60485	u421	m25	STEPHEN	He treats you okay?
L60484	u416	m25	HELEN	He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
L60483	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Sorry I hit Jackson.
L60482	u416	m25	HELEN	The great communicator.
L60481	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
L60480	u416	m25	HELEN	-- You remember.
L60479	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
L60478	u416	m25	HELEN	Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
L60477	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
L60476	u416	m25	HELEN	He's going to be a fireman.
L60475	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Oh yeah? How's he doing?
L60474	u416	m25	HELEN	He's got piano lessons.
L60473	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Where's Sean?
L60472	u416	m25	HELEN	It's not your roof anymore.
L60471	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Fixing my roof.
L60470	u416	m25	HELEN	Stephen, what are you doing here?
L60299	u416	m25	HELEN	Here we go...
L60298	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You can't talk about my brother like that...
L60291	u416	m25	HELEN	Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
L60290	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
L60518	u418	m25	RICCO	That's your job.
L60517	u420	m25	SHADOW	What the hell was it doing in the fire?
L60516	u418	m25	RICCO	Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
L60515	u420	m25	SHADOW	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
L60514	u418	m25	RICCO	See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
L60510	u420	m25	SHADOW	McCaffrey, hold this for us.
L60509	u418	m25	RICCO	Anyway, down here, take a look...
L60506	u418	m25	RICCO	There's something else kinda interesting...
L60505	u420	m25	SHADOW	Putty? On both doors?
L60504	u418	m25	RICCO	They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
L60427	u419	m25	RONALD	-- Burn it all.
L60426	u420	m25	SHADOW	And the world -- the whole world.
L60425	u419	m25	RONALD	-- Burn them.
L60424	u420	m25	SHADOW	And old ladies?
L60423	u419	m25	RONALD	-- Burn them.
L60419	u419	m25	RONALD	Absolutely.
L60418	u420	m25	SHADOW	Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
L60407	u419	m25	RONALD	Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
L60406	u420	m25	SHADOW	Nobody cares, Ronald.
L60405	u419	m25	RONALD	Did he tell you how we finally met?
L60404	u420	m25	SHADOW	Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
L60403	u419	m25	RONALD	Tell him about me, Shadow?
L60402	u420	m25	SHADOW	Knock it off. Now.
L60400	u419	m25	RONALD	I know you.
L60399	u420	m25	SHADOW	You don't know him.
L60396	u420	m25	SHADOW	You like everybody, Ronald.
L60395	u419	m25	RONALD	Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
L60394	u420	m25	SHADOW	He works for me.
L60393	u419	m25	RONALD	Who's this?
L60392	u420	m25	SHADOW	Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
L60391	u419	m25	RONALD	Didn't think you'd make it.
L60390	u420	m25	SHADOW	How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
L60389	u419	m25	RONALD	Shadow.
L60702	u420	m25	SHADOW	I need that report, Lt.
L60701	u421	m25	STEPHEN	It knows us. This one knows us.
L60700	u420	m25	SHADOW	I might.
L60699	u421	m25	STEPHEN	You don't know... nobody knows...
L60698	u420	m25	SHADOW	What do you listen to, Stephen?
L60697	u421	m25	STEPHEN	...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
L60696	u420	m25	SHADOW	I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
L60695	u421	m25	STEPHEN	I'm working on it.
L60058	u421	m25	STEPHEN	The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
L60057	u420	m25	SHADOW	Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
L60056	u421	m25	STEPHEN	Got a cause?
L60898	u420	m25	SHADOW	This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
L60897	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	I'm a little busy right now --
L60896	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Investigator...
L60895	u420	m25	SHADOW	Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
L60663	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Just catch the son of a bitch.
L60662	u420	m25	SHADOW	Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
L60661	u420	m25	SHADOW	Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
L60660	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
L60659	u420	m25	SHADOW	We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
L60658	u420	m25	SHADOW	No Marty, I don't.
L60657	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Don't you have any leads at all?
L60656	u420	m25	SHADOW	Don?
L60655	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
L60653	u420	m25	SHADOW	Alderman.
L60652	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Inspector.
L60188	u420	m25	SHADOW	I need to get in the trunk.
L60187	u422	m25	SWAYZAK	Investigator Rimgale.
L60186	u420	m25	SHADOW	Alderman Swayzak.
L66030	u479	m29	HARDY	Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
L66029	u476	m29	BARTENDER	Who?
L66028	u479	m29	HARDY	Bill Styles...
L66025	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
L66024	u476	m29	BARTENDER	Hurricane kept you up, too?
L66023	u479	m29	HARDY	"Don't you mean ""don't need no liquor license not taken away from me""?"
L66022	u476	m29	BARTENDER	You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
L66021	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah, if you've slept.
L66020	u476	m29	BARTENDER	It's ten thirty in the morning.
L66019	u479	m29	HARDY	Can I at least have a drink?
L66018	u479	m29	HARDY	You know that was like a quadruple negative?
L66017	u476	m29	BARTENDER	Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
L66621	u477	m29	CHILDS	None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
L66620	u480	m29	KENDALL	You framed-him...
L66370	u480	m29	KENDALL	Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
L66369	u477	m29	CHILDS	He is the only one unaccounted for.
L66344	u477	m29	CHILDS	Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
L66343	u480	m29	KENDALL	What about Pike?
L66326	u477	m29	CHILDS	It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
L66325	u480	m29	KENDALL	Did -- did you --
L66322	u477	m29	CHILDS	Fine.
L66321	u480	m29	KENDALL	I don't want to go --
L66320	u477	m29	CHILDS	Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
L66319	u480	m29	KENDALL	What do we do?
L66318	u477	m29	CHILDS	Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
L66306	u477	m29	CHILDS	Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
L66305	u480	m29	KENDALL	I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
L66304	u477	m29	CHILDS	A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
L66300	u480	m29	KENDALL	I'm -- I'm sorry...
L66299	u477	m29	CHILDS	Don't you ever point a gun at me!
L66619	u477	m29	CHILDS	Shut up, Mueller.
L66618	u481	m29	MUELLER	West was one thing, but this --
L66341	u477	m29	CHILDS	HEY!
L66340	u481	m29	MUELLER	Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
L66338	u481	m29	MUELLER	I don't know!
L66337	u477	m29	CHILDS	Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
L66336	u481	m29	MUELLER	We got -- I don't know, we got separated
L66332	u477	m29	CHILDS	We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
L66331	u481	m29	MUELLER	You killed him you fucking faggot --
L66330	u477	m29	CHILDS	We found him like this --
L66329	u481	m29	MUELLER	Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
L66328	u481	m29	MUELLER	Can anybody hear me!
L66327	u477	m29	CHILDS	This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
L66617	u477	m29	CHILDS	We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
L66616	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You too?
L66506	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Shut up.  West's dead.
L66505	u477	m29	CHILDS	Yeah, right...
L66484	u477	m29	CHILDS	We found him like this...
L66483	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
L66356	u478	m29	DUNBAR	What do you mean, alone?
L66355	u477	m29	CHILDS	What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
L66351	u477	m29	CHILDS	We don't know. West is dead.
L66350	u478	m29	DUNBAR	We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
L67044	u479	m29	HARDY	He's telling the truth up to a point...
L67043	u478	m29	DUNBAR	"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."
L67042	u479	m29	HARDY	I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
L66918	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
L66917	u479	m29	HARDY	And the bodies?
L66916	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
L66865	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
L66864	u479	m29	HARDY	Do what?
L66863	u478	m29	DUNBAR	He -- He made me do it --
L66853	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Jesus!
L66852	u479	m29	HARDY	Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
L66848	u479	m29	HARDY	We've found all of them.
L66847	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
L66846	u479	m29	HARDY	We don't need the tapes --
L66824	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You wanna bet?
L66823	u479	m29	HARDY	We're not finished yet --
L66635	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
L66634	u479	m29	HARDY	Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
L66629	u478	m29	DUNBAR	But not Pike's.
L66628	u479	m29	HARDY	You saved Kendall's life --
L66627	u478	m29	DUNBAR	They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
L66626	u479	m29	HARDY	You shot Childs and Nunez.
L66479	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Yeah --
L66478	u479	m29	HARDY	And he'd been shot.
L66475	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Of course --
L66474	u479	m29	HARDY	You saw West's body.
L66473	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I apologize --
L66444	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah, we know, Pike did.
L66443	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I didn't shoot West --
L66442	u479	m29	HARDY	So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
L66437	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
L66436	u479	m29	HARDY	"Fuck ""you're serious"", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it."
L66435	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I'm serious --
L66434	u479	m29	HARDY	Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
L66433	u478	m29	DUNBAR	He's lying.
L66432	u479	m29	HARDY	That'd be my reaction too --
L66431	u478	m29	DUNBAR	That son of a bitch.
L66430	u479	m29	HARDY	Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
L66200	u479	m29	HARDY	No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
L66199	u478	m29	DUNBAR	This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
L66198	u479	m29	HARDY	You smoke, Ray?
L66197	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
L66196	u479	m29	HARDY	And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
L66149	u479	m29	HARDY	Tell me about them.
L66148	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Some.
L66147	u479	m29	HARDY	Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
L66146	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I'm not telling you what happened.
L66145	u479	m29	HARDY	Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
L66136	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Okay.
L66135	u479	m29	HARDY	Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
L66129	u479	m29	HARDY	They're dead, aren't they?
L66128	u478	m29	DUNBAR	There's no need...
L66125	u479	m29	HARDY	Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
L66124	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You did Basic here?
L66123	u479	m29	HARDY	C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
L66122	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I don't know... I like the Army.
L66121	u479	m29	HARDY	What do you like then?
L66120	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I just don't like it.
L66119	u479	m29	HARDY	Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
L66118	u478	m29	DUNBAR	It's... too slow.
L66117	u479	m29	HARDY	You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
L66116	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I asked for a policeman.
L66115	u479	m29	HARDY	Why not?
L66851	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
L66850	u482	m29	OSBORNE	How do you know that?
L66849	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Ohhhh, I don't think so...
L66844	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
L66843	u482	m29	OSBORNE	We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
L66842	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
L66840	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Can't do that now, though, can you?
L66839	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
L66633	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
L66632	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Where's the cabin?
L66631	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Would you have believed me?
L66630	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
L66493	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Yeah.
L66492	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Mueller was alone in the cabin?
L66491	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Back up.
L66481	u478	m29	DUNBAR	One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
L66480	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What about the phosphorous grenade?
L66477	u478	m29	DUNBAR	The creek bed --
L66476	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Where?
L66441	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
L66440	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What business?
L66439	u478	m29	DUNBAR	No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
L66438	u482	m29	OSBORNE	He said he worked there --
L66195	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
L66194	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Epilepsy.
L66193	u478	m29	DUNBAR	He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
L66187	u478	m29	DUNBAR	There were six of us...
L66186	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
L66185	u478	m29	DUNBAR	That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
L66183	u478	m29	DUNBAR	No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
L66182	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
L67009	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Your weapons, Sergeant.
L67008	u487	m29	WEST	What the fuck is going on?
L66172	u487	m29	WEST	The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
L66171	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Sir, yes, sir!
L66170	u487	m29	WEST	Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
L66169	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Sir, yes, sir!
L66168	u487	m29	WEST	You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
L66167	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Sir, Dunbar, sir!
L66166	u487	m29	WEST	Cadet, what's your name!
L66614	u481	m29	MUELLER	I...
L66613	u478	m29	DUNBAR	So you killed him?
L66495	u478	m29	DUNBAR	So did we. Why didn't you come?
L66494	u481	m29	MUELLER	Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
L66490	u478	m29	DUNBAR	West... he's dead.
L66489	u481	m29	MUELLER	Jesus, what happened?
L66373	u478	m29	DUNBAR	We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
L66372	u481	m29	MUELLER	Why?
L66371	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
L66365	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
L66364	u481	m29	MUELLER	Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
L66363	u478	m29	DUNBAR	He wouldn't kill anybody...
L66604	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Put it down!
L66603	u483	m29	PIKE	A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
L66575	u483	m29	PIKE	We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
L66574	u478	m29	DUNBAR	No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
L66573	u483	m29	PIKE	There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
L66572	u478	m29	DUNBAR	This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
L66571	u483	m29	PIKE	What don't you know?
L66570	u478	m29	DUNBAR	I... I don't know...
L66561	u483	m29	PIKE	Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
L66560	u478	m29	DUNBAR	They?
L66559	u483	m29	PIKE	Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
L66557	u483	m29	PIKE	That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
L66556	u478	m29	DUNBAR	His chest was hamburger --
L66555	u483	m29	PIKE	From up close or far away?
L66554	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Full clip to the body --
L66553	u483	m29	PIKE	You saw West, right? How was he killed?
L66552	u478	m29	DUNBAR	That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
L66551	u483	m29	PIKE	Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
L66550	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Why... why didn't you tell me?
L66545	u483	m29	PIKE	Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
L66544	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You're lying --
L66543	u483	m29	PIKE	Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
L66542	u483	m29	PIKE	Just look. Little pocket.
L66541	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Why?
L66540	u483	m29	PIKE	Look in my pack.
L66539	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Bullshit.
L66538	u483	m29	PIKE	Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
L66537	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You hated West, Mueller loved him --
L66536	u483	m29	PIKE	Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
L66535	u478	m29	DUNBAR	That's exactly what he says about you.
L66534	u483	m29	PIKE	We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
L66533	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Oh, come on --
L66532	u483	m29	PIKE	Mueller.
L66531	u478	m29	DUNBAR	If not you, then who?
L66530	u483	m29	PIKE	Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
L66529	u483	m29	PIKE	Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
L66528	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You're the only one missing a grenade.
L66527	u483	m29	PIKE	Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
L66526	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You hated West more than any of us.
L66525	u483	m29	PIKE	You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
L66524	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Yeah...
L66523	u483	m29	PIKE	Right?
L66517	u483	m29	PIKE	Do I?
L66516	u478	m29	DUNBAR	You know it's not like that --
L66513	u483	m29	PIKE	Why?
L66512	u478	m29	DUNBAR	We just want to check your pack --
L66511	u483	m29	PIKE	Roberto, what the fuck?
L66504	u483	m29	PIKE	Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
L66503	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Where have you been, Jay?
L66379	u483	m29	PIKE	I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
L66378	u478	m29	DUNBAR	What do you mean, West's?
L66377	u483	m29	PIKE	West's. Any kindling for afire?
L66376	u478	m29	DUNBAR	Whose blood is that, Jay?
L66753	u480	m29	KENDALL	Maybe he...
L66752	u479	m29	HARDY	MAYBE WHAT --
L66751	u480	m29	KENDALL	Maybe --
L66750	u479	m29	HARDY	Where are they!
L66749	u480	m29	KENDALL	I don't know --
L66748	u479	m29	HARDY	You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
L66747	u479	m29	HARDY	But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
L66746	u480	m29	KENDALL	I didn't --
L66745	u479	m29	HARDY	Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
L66727	u480	m29	KENDALL	Because I was standing next to him.
L66726	u479	m29	HARDY	How do you know?
L66722	u480	m29	KENDALL	Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
L66721	u479	m29	HARDY	Why?
L66708	u480	m29	KENDALL	I didn't do anything --
L66707	u479	m29	HARDY	Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
L66702	u480	m29	KENDALL	I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
L66701	u479	m29	HARDY	Something funny, Levi?
L66692	u480	m29	KENDALL	Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
L66691	u479	m29	HARDY	Dunbar will testify that you were.
L66689	u480	m29	KENDALL	Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
L66688	u479	m29	HARDY	Well?
L66687	u480	m29	KENDALL	"I believe your next line is ""What are you trying to hide?"""
L66686	u479	m29	HARDY	"Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said ""Dunbar was gone,"" My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie."
L66685	u480	m29	KENDALL	No. I said Dunbar.
L66684	u479	m29	HARDY	Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
L66683	u480	m29	KENDALL	So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
L66682	u479	m29	HARDY	Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
L66679	u480	m29	KENDALL	There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
L66678	u479	m29	HARDY	Is it the truth?
L66675	u479	m29	HARDY	My heart weeps.
L66674	u480	m29	KENDALL	Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
L66672	u479	m29	HARDY	Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
L66671	u480	m29	KENDALL	How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
L66670	u479	m29	HARDY	You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
L66486	u479	m29	HARDY	Stop.
L66485	u480	m29	KENDALL	Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
L66404	u480	m29	KENDALL	Mr. Hardy?
L66403	u479	m29	HARDY	Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
L66402	u480	m29	KENDALL	I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
L66401	u479	m29	HARDY	Why did he come back for you?
L66381	u480	m29	KENDALL	Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
L66380	u479	m29	HARDY	He admitted it.
L66311	u480	m29	KENDALL	No. Poetic justice, though.
L66310	u479	m29	HARDY	But you didn't.
L66309	u480	m29	KENDALL	Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
L66294	u479	m29	HARDY	Then who did?
L66293	u480	m29	KENDALL	I didn't kill him --
L66292	u479	m29	HARDY	"What happened to ""degrees""?"
L66291	u480	m29	KENDALL	You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
L66290	u479	m29	HARDY	"Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called ""motive"" and you just gave yourself one."
L66262	u480	m29	KENDALL	The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
L66261	u479	m29	HARDY	"I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."
L66260	u480	m29	KENDALL	He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
L66259	u479	m29	HARDY	Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
L66258	u480	m29	KENDALL	My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
L66244	u480	m29	KENDALL	My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
L66243	u479	m29	HARDY	But not the only victim, right?
L66242	u480	m29	KENDALL	I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
L66241	u479	m29	HARDY	Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
L66240	u480	m29	KENDALL	That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
L66239	u479	m29	HARDY	Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
L66238	u480	m29	KENDALL	You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
L66980	u479	m29	HARDY	Get your hands away from the desk!
L66979	u485	m29	STYLES	For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
L66978	u479	m29	HARDY	You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
L66977	u485	m29	STYLES	You're crazy --
L66976	u479	m29	HARDY	No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
L66975	u479	m29	HARDY	Not for long.
L66974	u485	m29	STYLES	You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
L66973	u479	m29	HARDY	No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
L66972	u485	m29	STYLES	I'm not even going to dignify that --
L66971	u479	m29	HARDY	You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
L66970	u485	m29	STYLES	I wanted to see if he was okay --
L66969	u479	m29	HARDY	Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
L66968	u485	m29	STYLES	That's preposterous --
L66967	u479	m29	HARDY	What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
L66966	u479	m29	HARDY	West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
L66965	u485	m29	STYLES	Or what? You've gone round the bend --
L66964	u479	m29	HARDY	Stay where you are.
L66962	u479	m29	HARDY	I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
L66961	u485	m29	STYLES	You're drunk --
L66960	u479	m29	HARDY	If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
L66959	u485	m29	STYLES	What are you talking about?
L66958	u479	m29	HARDY	It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
L66789	u485	m29	STYLES	I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
L66788	u479	m29	HARDY	You're a good soldier, Bill.
L66787	u485	m29	STYLES	Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
L66786	u479	m29	HARDY	I'm sorry, Bill.
L66785	u485	m29	STYLES	The Senator...
L66784	u479	m29	HARDY	They're taking your command, aren't they?
L66781	u479	m29	HARDY	I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
L66780	u485	m29	STYLES	You think you could explain all this to me?
L66778	u485	m29	STYLES	Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
L66777	u479	m29	HARDY	That's horseshit and you know it.
L66776	u485	m29	STYLES	It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
L66654	u485	m29	STYLES	Does Osborne agree?
L66653	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah.
L66652	u485	m29	STYLES	Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
L66651	u479	m29	HARDY	What I said before --
L66455	u479	m29	HARDY	I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
L66454	u485	m29	STYLES	What the hell are you talking about --
L66453	u479	m29	HARDY	You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
L66452	u485	m29	STYLES	What about the confession?
L66451	u479	m29	HARDY	Home, I'm done.
L66450	u485	m29	STYLES	Tom, where are you going --
L66429	u485	m29	STYLES	JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
L66428	u479	m29	HARDY	You mean not enough to save you.
L66427	u485	m29	STYLES	Not for me.
L66426	u479	m29	HARDY	Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
L66425	u485	m29	STYLES	Nevertheless --
L66424	u479	m29	HARDY	From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
L66423	u485	m29	STYLES	Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
L66422	u479	m29	HARDY	Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
L66421	u485	m29	STYLES	Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
L66420	u479	m29	HARDY	There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
L66419	u485	m29	STYLES	We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
L66408	u479	m29	HARDY	Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
L66407	u485	m29	STYLES	Who killed Pike?
L66406	u479	m29	HARDY	Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
L66205	u485	m29	STYLES	He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
L66204	u479	m29	HARDY	He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
L66073	u479	m29	HARDY	I'm not gonna let that happen.
L66072	u485	m29	STYLES	Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
L66071	u479	m29	HARDY	And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
L66070	u485	m29	STYLES	The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
L66069	u479	m29	HARDY	Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
L66066	u485	m29	STYLES	Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
L66065	u479	m29	HARDY	I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
L66064	u485	m29	STYLES	No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
L66063	u479	m29	HARDY	And the problem is you only got three.
L66062	u485	m29	STYLES	"The exercise was one of his Section Eight ""private sessions"". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning."
L66058	u479	m29	HARDY	Well, he's a good soldier.
L66057	u485	m29	STYLES	A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
L66053	u479	m29	HARDY	It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
L66052	u485	m29	STYLES	"The official term for it is ""Clusterfuck"". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant..."
L66049	u479	m29	HARDY	And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
L66048	u485	m29	STYLES	This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
L66046	u479	m29	HARDY	Tell me what I can do.
L66045	u485	m29	STYLES	Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
L66044	u479	m29	HARDY	That bad?
L66043	u479	m29	HARDY	What kind of trouble are you in?
L66042	u485	m29	STYLES	Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
L66041	u479	m29	HARDY	How are you?
L66996	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
L66995	u482	m29	OSBORNE	He was your friend.
L66994	u479	m29	HARDY	In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
L66993	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Your phone number?
L66992	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Yeah.
L66991	u479	m29	HARDY	I should probably write that down.
L66990	u482	m29	OSBORNE	A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
L66989	u479	m29	HARDY	Want company?
L66988	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Nah.
L66987	u479	m29	HARDY	Think it'll work?
L66986	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
L66985	u479	m29	HARDY	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
L66984	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What are you doing out here?
L66954	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
L66953	u479	m29	HARDY	Do I have a choice in this?
L66951	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
L66950	u479	m29	HARDY	West?
L66946	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
L66945	u479	m29	HARDY	Really.
L66944	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You're a good man, Hardy.
L66943	u479	m29	HARDY	There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
L66942	u482	m29	OSBORNE	That's not true.
L66939	u479	m29	HARDY	Tough.
L66938	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What if I don't want it?
L66937	u479	m29	HARDY	This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
L66936	u482	m29	OSBORNE	This isn't the time --
L66934	u479	m29	HARDY	"Seven guys. What was it you said? You were ""just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said""."
L66933	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What?
L66932	u479	m29	HARDY	Seven.
L66931	u482	m29	OSBORNE	We need to talk --
L66920	u479	m29	HARDY	No death certificates. No crime.
L66919	u482	m29	OSBORNE	No bodies, no West...
L66859	u479	m29	HARDY	WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
L66858	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Hardy, for Chrissakes --
L66857	u479	m29	HARDY	We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
L66855	u479	m29	HARDY	Isn't this how your story goes?
L66854	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Hardy, what are you doing --
L66832	u479	m29	HARDY	Right back where we started.
L66831	u482	m29	OSBORNE	We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
L66819	u479	m29	HARDY	Get in.
L66818	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Four --
L66803	u479	m29	HARDY	Good, just making sure.
L66802	u482	m29	OSBORNE	No.
L66801	u479	m29	HARDY	Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
L66800	u482	m29	OSBORNE	We were close to something with Kendall.
L66799	u479	m29	HARDY	That's gonna stay my secret.
L66798	u482	m29	OSBORNE	For what?
L66797	u479	m29	HARDY	It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
L66796	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You know, you never told me why you left the army.
L66795	u479	m29	HARDY	Nah.
L66794	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Think it'll work?
L66793	u479	m29	HARDY	Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
L66792	u482	m29	OSBORNE	So what now?
L66775	u482	m29	OSBORNE	So did I.
L66774	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah.
L66773	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You wanted to break him.
L66772	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You mean the falsely accused?
L66771	u479	m29	HARDY	No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
L66770	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You wanted to get the truth.
L66769	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah, I could've. Should've.
L66768	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You couldn't have known --
L66767	u479	m29	HARDY	I pushed him too hard.
L66712	u482	m29	OSBORNE	See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
L66711	u479	m29	HARDY	That's a fantastic idea --
L66704	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Good idea.
L66703	u479	m29	HARDY	Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
L66699	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
L66698	u479	m29	HARDY	Are you sure?
L66697	u482	m29	OSBORNE	"What Kendall said -- ""the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around."" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter."
L66696	u479	m29	HARDY	What?
L66695	u482	m29	OSBORNE	They got their stories straight.
L66694	u479	m29	HARDY	We're fucked, I know --
L66649	u479	m29	HARDY	Let's go talk to Bill...
L66648	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Little bit.
L66647	u479	m29	HARDY	That bugs you too?
L66646	u482	m29	OSBORNE	So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
L66645	u479	m29	HARDY	And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
L66644	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Buttfucks the cabin?
L66643	u479	m29	HARDY	Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
L66642	u482	m29	OSBORNE	So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
L66641	u479	m29	HARDY	And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
L66640	u482	m29	OSBORNE	They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
L66639	u479	m29	HARDY	Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
L66638	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Dunbar.
L66637	u479	m29	HARDY	And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
L66636	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
L66499	u479	m29	HARDY	What happened next?
L66498	u482	m29	OSBORNE	At least you and Kendall agree on that.
L66472	u479	m29	HARDY	Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
L66471	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What?
L66470	u479	m29	HARDY	I didn't shoot West...
L66468	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
L66467	u479	m29	HARDY	Why do you care?
L66466	u482	m29	OSBORNE	But you will.
L66465	u479	m29	HARDY	"Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my ""great second chance"", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --"
L66464	u482	m29	OSBORNE	I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
L66463	u479	m29	HARDY	Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
L66462	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
L66461	u479	m29	HARDY	West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
L66460	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
L66459	u479	m29	HARDY	Watch me.
L66458	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
L66457	u479	m29	HARDY	You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
L66456	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
L66449	u482	m29	OSBORNE	I don't know.
L66448	u479	m29	HARDY	Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
L66417	u479	m29	HARDY	Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
L66416	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
L66415	u479	m29	HARDY	Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
L66414	u482	m29	OSBORNE	I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
L66413	u479	m29	HARDY	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
L66412	u482	m29	OSBORNE	I don't think that has anything to do with --
L66411	u479	m29	HARDY	Too neat. How long have you been an investigator?
L66252	u479	m29	HARDY	I lied. Wait for it...
L66251	u482	m29	OSBORNE	But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
L66250	u479	m29	HARDY	Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
L66249	u482	m29	OSBORNE	That was kid gloves?
L66237	u479	m29	HARDY	Got it.
L66236	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
L66232	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Not the happiest of memories?
L66231	u479	m29	HARDY	Being back here. Gives me the willies.
L66230	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Something wrong?
L66229	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What point?
L66228	u479	m29	HARDY	He's telling the truth, up to a point.
L66227	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
L66226	u479	m29	HARDY	You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
L66225	u479	m29	HARDY	So noted.
L66224	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You're off to a late start.
L66223	u479	m29	HARDY	I plan to grow on you.
L66222	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
L66221	u479	m29	HARDY	The very same.
L66220	u482	m29	OSBORNE	This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
L66218	u479	m29	HARDY	Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
L66217	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You're kidding.
L66216	u479	m29	HARDY	I lost a bet.
L66215	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Something like that. You?
L66214	u479	m29	HARDY	You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
L66213	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
L66212	u479	m29	HARDY	Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
L66211	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What is that?
L66210	u479	m29	HARDY	Best time for banal chit-chat.
L66209	u482	m29	OSBORNE	We're in the middle of a murder case --
L66208	u479	m29	HARDY	You're right. We should sit in silence.
L66207	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
L66140	u479	m29	HARDY	Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
L66139	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You made me look like an idiot --
L66138	u479	m29	HARDY	I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
L66137	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Baseball?
L66133	u479	m29	HARDY	"See, Ray, this is what we call ""good cop, bad cop"". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established."
L66132	u482	m29	OSBORNE	The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
L66102	u479	m29	HARDY	Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
L66101	u482	m29	OSBORNE	I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
L66099	u479	m29	HARDY	Something like that.
L66098	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Good cop/bad cop?
L66097	u479	m29	HARDY	Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
L66096	u479	m29	HARDY	Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
L66095	u482	m29	OSBORNE	That is the most unprofessional --
L66094	u479	m29	HARDY	Is Dunbar cute?
L66093	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Excuse me?
L66092	u479	m29	HARDY	Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
L66091	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Why?
L66090	u479	m29	HARDY	Move him.
L66089	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Yes.
L66088	u479	m29	HARDY	He's in interrogation?
L66087	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
L66086	u479	m29	HARDY	Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
L66085	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
L66084	u479	m29	HARDY	Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
L66083	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
L66082	u479	m29	HARDY	Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
L66081	u479	m29	HARDY	Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
L66080	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
L66079	u479	m29	HARDY	It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
L66078	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
L66077	u479	m29	HARDY	He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
L66076	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You and the Colonel go back.
L66075	u479	m29	HARDY	Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
L66061	u479	m29	HARDY	And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
L66060	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
L66059	u479	m29	HARDY	I didn't mean that as a compliment.
L66056	u479	m29	HARDY	He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
L66055	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You knew Sergeant West?
L66054	u479	m29	HARDY	Ah, Christ
L66051	u479	m29	HARDY	Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
L66050	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Hostile and uncooperative.
L66608	u483	m29	PIKE	Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
L66607	u480	m29	KENDALL	Pike, please --
L66392	u483	m29	PIKE	Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
L66391	u480	m29	KENDALL	I don't think I want to hear this --
L66390	u483	m29	PIKE	Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
L66389	u480	m29	KENDALL	How?
L66388	u483	m29	PIKE	A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
L66387	u480	m29	KENDALL	What are you talking about?
L66386	u483	m29	PIKE	The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
L66592	u481	m29	MUELLER	To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
L66591	u480	m29	KENDALL	So you took off your shirt?
L66590	u481	m29	MUELLER	I was freezing from the hurricane --
L66361	u481	m29	MUELLER	I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
L66360	u480	m29	KENDALL	Oh, you remember now --
L66359	u481	m29	MUELLER	I remember now, it was before the explosion --
L66358	u480	m29	KENDALL	Yeah and he doesn't know when --
L66357	u481	m29	MUELLER	Pike and I got separated --
L66354	u481	m29	MUELLER	You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
L66353	u480	m29	KENDALL	Poor fucker my ass...
L66352	u481	m29	MUELLER	They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
L66278	u481	m29	MUELLER	"Oh, yeah, ""Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on."" He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland."
L66277	u480	m29	KENDALL	We should tell him we're not going.
L66274	u481	m29	MUELLER	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
L66273	u480	m29	KENDALL	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
L66272	u481	m29	MUELLER	The faggot speaks.
L66271	u480	m29	KENDALL	Maybe we shouldn't go.
L66738	u480	m29	KENDALL	He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
L66737	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What happened with Nunez?
L66735	u482	m29	OSBORNE	So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
L66734	u480	m29	KENDALL	I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
L66733	u480	m29	KENDALL	I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
L66725	u480	m29	KENDALL	Childs.
L66724	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Who, Levi --
L66720	u480	m29	KENDALL	We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
L66719	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Wrong answer --
L66718	u480	m29	KENDALL	Dunbar's telling the truth.
L66717	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What.
L66716	u480	m29	KENDALL	Wait --
L66715	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Enjoy your flight to Washington --
L66714	u482	m29	OSBORNE	It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
L66713	u480	m29	KENDALL	It won't work --
L66710	u480	m29	KENDALL	What?
L66709	u482	m29	OSBORNE	It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
L66706	u480	m29	KENDALL	You can't threaten me --
L66705	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
L66681	u480	m29	KENDALL	Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
L66680	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Dunbar says you were.
L66677	u480	m29	KENDALL	No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
L66676	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Pike never confessed.
L66669	u480	m29	KENDALL	Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
L66668	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Fifty minutes.
L66667	u480	m29	KENDALL	Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
L66666	u480	m29	KENDALL	We've been making progress, I see.
L66665	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Pike never confessed.
L66400	u480	m29	KENDALL	Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
L66399	u482	m29	OSBORNE	But you didn't see it, right?
L66398	u480	m29	KENDALL	Because he'd shot Mueller.
L66397	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
L66289	u480	m29	KENDALL	He whispered it in my ear.
L66288	u482	m29	OSBORNE	No one else heard it?
L66287	u480	m29	KENDALL	You're gonna die tonight, faggot. Clear as day.
L66286	u482	m29	OSBORNE	He said what?
L66264	u480	m29	KENDALL	He wanted more than that.
L66263	u482	m29	OSBORNE	He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
L66246	u480	m29	KENDALL	"What, ""The Truth""? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem."
L66245	u482	m29	OSBORNE	We just want --
L66606	u483	m29	PIKE	-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
L66605	u481	m29	MUELLER	Tell him to shut up --
L66600	u481	m29	MUELLER	Shut up!
L66599	u483	m29	PIKE	Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
L66598	u481	m29	MUELLER	Bullshit --
L66597	u483	m29	PIKE	You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
L66596	u481	m29	MUELLER	The fuck are you talking about --
L66595	u483	m29	PIKE	Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
L66594	u481	m29	MUELLER	We're not going anywhere.
L66593	u483	m29	PIKE	Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
L66589	u483	m29	PIKE	Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
L66588	u481	m29	MUELLER	I used it to start the fire --
L66587	u483	m29	PIKE	Where's your shirt, Mueller?
L66586	u481	m29	MUELLER	We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
L66582	u481	m29	MUELLER	Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
L66581	u483	m29	PIKE	This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
L66579	u481	m29	MUELLER	What the fuck are you doing?
L66578	u483	m29	PIKE	Thank God...
L66515	u483	m29	PIKE	Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
L66514	u481	m29	MUELLER	Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
L66502	u481	m29	MUELLER	What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
L66501	u483	m29	PIKE	What the fuck happened to you --
L66270	u481	m29	MUELLER	Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
L66269	u483	m29	PIKE	Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
L66815	u484	m29	SERGEANT	Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
L66814	u482	m29	OSBORNE	So?
L66811	u484	m29	SERGEANT	You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
L66810	u482	m29	OSBORNE	No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
L66809	u484	m29	SERGEANT	Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
L66807	u484	m29	SERGEANT	Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
L66806	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Yeah.
L66805	u484	m29	SERGEANT	Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
L67038	u485	m29	STYLES	The army kicked you out for drugs...
L67037	u482	m29	OSBORNE	You never told me why you got kicked out of...
L66783	u485	m29	STYLES	Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
L66782	u482	m29	OSBORNE	What happens to Dunbar now?
L66661	u485	m29	STYLES	I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
L66660	u482	m29	OSBORNE	We know.
L66659	u485	m29	STYLES	You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
L66658	u482	m29	OSBORNE	He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
L66657	u485	m29	STYLES	You want Kendall, don't you?
L66410	u482	m29	OSBORNE	It's too neat.
L66409	u485	m29	STYLES	What do you think?
L66142	u482	m29	OSBORNE	No --
L66141	u485	m29	STYLES	You think he did it?
L66068	u485	m29	STYLES	I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
L66067	u482	m29	OSBORNE	Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
L66039	u485	m29	STYLES	Then it's unofficial.
L66038	u482	m29	OSBORNE	He's not Army, it's not official --
L66037	u485	m29	STYLES	He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
L66036	u482	m29	OSBORNE	But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
L66035	u485	m29	STYLES	He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
L66034	u482	m29	OSBORNE	This is totally unnecessary --
L66283	u487	m29	WEST	LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
L66282	u486	m29	THE CADETS	Sir, yes, sir!
L66281	u487	m29	WEST	Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
L66157	u487	m29	WEST	So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
L66156	u486	m29	THE CADETS	Sir, yes, sir!
L66155	u487	m29	WEST	In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L66154	u486	m29	THE CADETS	Sir, yes, sir!
L66153	u487	m29	WEST	Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L66152	u486	m29	THE CADETS	Sir, yes, sir!
L66151	u487	m29	WEST	You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L97520	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
L97519	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
L97518	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
L97208	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	Okay honey.
L97207	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
L97206	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	I've seen a few.
L97205	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
L97204	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
L97203	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
L96982	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	I'm not sick.
L96981	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
L96827	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
L96826	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
L96788	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
L96787	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
L96767	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. How's Dad?
L96766	u568	m36	AUNT BARBARA	You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
L96765	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
L97482	u573	m36	FRANK	Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
L97481	u569	m36	BEN	See you Tuesday, Frank.

L97466	u569	m36	BEN	If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
L97465	u573	m36	FRANK	Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
L97464	u569	m36	BEN	To your health, Frank.
L97458	u569	m36	BEN	Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
L97457	u573	m36	FRANK	Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!

This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.

L97455	u573	m36	FRANK	Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
L97454	u569	m36	BEN	Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
L97453	u573	m36	FRANK	Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
L97452	u569	m36	BEN	Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
L97451	u573	m36	FRANK	Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
L97450	u569	m36	BEN	Frank. Come in.
L97681	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Oh my God. Is her son OK?
L97680	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Not yet.
L97679	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
L97678	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
L97672	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
L97671	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
L97670	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
L97669	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
L97548	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes sir.
L97547	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
L97546	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes sir. I sure am.
L97545	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	You're all through with this now?
L97544	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Only you and the photo lab.
L97543	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Who knows you have these?
L97542	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No, not at all.
L97541	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Is Sandy part of this?
L97540	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
L97539	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
L97538	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
L97537	u574	m36	JEFFREY	And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
L97535	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
L97534	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Okay?
L97533	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah.
L97532	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
L97531	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
L97530	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Jeffrey! Come on in.
L97444	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	It's blue. Blue velvet.
L97443	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What color is it?
L97268	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
L97267	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What is this? What color is it?
L97266	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. I get it.
L97265	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
L97264	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Why do you do it?
L97263	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
L97262	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I guess you've seen some bad things.
L97261	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yes.
L97260	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Is that why you say it's horrible?
L97259	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	The criminals are winning.
L97258	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Anything you can tell me?
L97257	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Okay.
L97256	u574	m36	JEFFREY	These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
L97254	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
L97253	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes?
L97252	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Jeffrey?
L96857	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
L96856	u574	m36	JEFFREY	It must be great.
L96855	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
L96854	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
L96853	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
L96850	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
L96849	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Come into the study a minute.
L96820	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
L96819	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
L96818	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
L96812	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
L96811	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
L96810	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	You did? A human ear?
L96809	u574	m36	JEFFREY	He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
L96808	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
L96807	u574	m36	JEFFREY	My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
L96806	u570	m36	DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yes.
L96805	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Are you Detective Williams?
L97645	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Hold me. I'M FALLING!
L97644	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
L97643	u571	m36	DOROTHY	HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
L97642	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Don? Where is he?
L97641	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Hold me, Don.
L97635	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
L97634	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Who, Dorothy?
L97633	u571	m36	DOROTHY	They hurt his head.
L97624	u571	m36	DOROTHY	My secret lover.
L97623	u574	m36	JEFFREY	It's okay. It's okay.
L97622	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
L97618	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
L97617	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah, it's me.
L97424	u571	m36	DOROTHY	No.  Hi baby.
L97423	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Oh no.
L97421	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You look beautiful to me.
L97420	u571	m36	DOROTHY	I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
L97419	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What?
L97418	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
L97417	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'll call you.
L97415	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I think I better go.
L97414	u571	m36	DOROTHY	I want you to stay with me.
L97413	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I guess I should go.
L97410	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
L97409	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
L97408	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes.
L97407	u571	m36	DOROTHY	I did. Are you?
L97406	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You called me Jeffrey.
L97405	u571	m36	DOROTHY	If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
L97404	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Dorothy. No!

L97402	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'm glad you do.
L97401	u571	m36	DOROTHY	Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?

Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
L97682	u572	m36	F.B.I. MAN	We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?

L96786	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
L96785	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Thanks a lot, Mom.
L96784	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
L96783	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What?
L96782	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
L96781	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah?
L96780	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	Jeffrey, when you see your father.
L96779	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Well. Okay.
L96778	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
L96777	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What time are visiting hours?
L96774	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Be right down.
L96773	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
L96764	u574	m36	JEFFREY	This is it.
L96763	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
L96756	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Mom.
L96755	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
L96754	u574	m36	JEFFREY	For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
L96753	u577	m36	MRS. BEAUMONT	I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
L97630	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	I'll get a coat for her.
L97629	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Sandy?... Sandy, please.
L97251	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
L97250	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
L97249	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
L97237	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
L97236	u574	m36	JEFFREY	That sounds great!
L97235	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
L96860	u574	m36	JEFFREY	"Say ""goodnight"" to Sandy."
L96859	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
L96858	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
L96845	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah.
L96844	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	He comes over to study.
L96838	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. okay.
L96837	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
L96836	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No. No thank you.
L96835	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Would you like a piece of cake?
L96834	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah, I know.
L96833	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
L96832	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Alright.
L96831	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
L96830	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
L96829	u578	m36	MRS. WILLIAMS	Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
L96828	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
L97606	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
L97605	u575	m36	MIKE	Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
L97221	u575	m36	MIKE	Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
L97220	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
L97219	u575	m36	MIKE	I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
L97218	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No, you're right.
L97217	u575	m36	MIKE	I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
L97216	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Well.
L97215	u575	m36	MIKE	Looks like you'd make a good runner.
L97214	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No.
L97692	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Good deal Dad.
L97691	u576	m36	MR. BEAUMONT	Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
L97690	u574	m36	JEFFREY	How ya doin' Dad?
L96802	u574	m36	JEFFREY	It's good to see you, Dad.
L96801	u576	m36	MR. BEAUMONT	Good to see you, son.
L96800	u576	m36	MR. BEAUMONT	Uh-uh.
L96799	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Are you feeling okay?
L96798	u576	m36	MR. BEAUMONT	Uh-uh.
L96797	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
L96796	u576	m36	MR. BEAUMONT	Hey Jeff.
L96795	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Hi Dad.
L97694	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
L97693	u580	m36	SANDY	Look Jeffrey.
L97650	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
L97649	u580	m36	SANDY	No Jeffrey!!
L97648	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
L97640	u580	m36	SANDY	Go ahead!
L97639	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Sandy?
L97638	u580	m36	SANDY	Go ahead.
L97637	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I should go with her, Sandy.
L97632	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Shhh. I'll tell you.
L97631	u580	m36	SANDY	Jeffrey? What's going on?
L97614	u580	m36	SANDY	Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
L97613	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
L97612	u580	m36	SANDY	Probably not. No. Why?
L97611	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
L97610	u580	m36	SANDY	Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
L97604	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes.
L97603	u580	m36	SANDY	Dorothy Vallens?
L97602	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Dorothy!... Dorothy!
L97595	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
L97594	u580	m36	SANDY	No.
L97593	u574	m36	JEFFREY	My father has a gun at home.
L97590	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Frank!!!
L97589	u580	m36	SANDY	Oh my God. What's wrong?
L97586	u580	m36	SANDY	Okay.
L97585	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You want to dance?
L97583	u580	m36	SANDY	Just a minute.
L97582	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Let's wait for some slow one.
L97581	u580	m36	SANDY	NO.
L97580	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Really. You want to dance with someone else?
L97579	u580	m36	SANDY	Really?
L97578	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I can't dance fast.
L97577	u580	m36	SANDY	You want to dance?
L97576	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
L97575	u580	m36	SANDY	Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
L97574	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You look beautiful.
L97573	u580	m36	SANDY	It's okay.
L97572	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
L97571	u580	m36	SANDY	Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
L97570	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Where to?
L97569	u580	m36	SANDY	It's good to see you.
L97568	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
L97567	u580	m36	SANDY	What was that all about?
L97563	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Just some fatherly advice.
L97562	u580	m36	SANDY	What is it?
L97561	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay.
L97554	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay. Great!
L97553	u580	m36	SANDY	I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
L97552	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No.
L97551	u580	m36	SANDY	You didn't tell him about me?
L97550	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
L97549	u580	m36	SANDY	Everything okay?
L97525	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
L97524	u580	m36	SANDY	Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
L97523	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
L97348	u580	m36	SANDY	Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
L97347	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You worry about me really?
L97344	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
L97343	u580	m36	SANDY	You like mysteries that much?
L97342	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
L97341	u580	m36	SANDY	Jeffrey? Why?
L97340	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah.
L97339	u580	m36	SANDY	I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
L97338	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
L97337	u580	m36	SANDY	Jeffrey!!
L97336	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
L97335	u580	m36	SANDY	Oh yeah?
L97334	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
L97333	u580	m36	SANDY	Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
L97332	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
L97331	u580	m36	SANDY	Shoot.
L97330	u574	m36	JEFFREY	That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
L97329	u580	m36	SANDY	You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
L97328	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
L97327	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You want to go talk to him?
L97326	u580	m36	SANDY	What am I going to do?
L97325	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'm really sorry.
L97324	u580	m36	SANDY	You were late.
L97307	u574	m36	JEFFREY	See ya tomorrow.
L97306	u580	m36	SANDY	Goodnight.
L97305	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay, okay.
L97304	u580	m36	SANDY	You better not, Jeffrey.
L97303	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Can I give you a kiss good night?
L97302	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay, Sandy.
L97301	u580	m36	SANDY	Okay, be careful.
L97300	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
L97299	u580	m36	SANDY	No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
L97298	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
L97297	u580	m36	SANDY	So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
L97296	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
L97295	u580	m36	SANDY	I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
L97294	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
L97293	u580	m36	SANDY	You're sure right. It is a strange world.
L97292	u574	m36	JEFFREY	That's what I thought.
L97291	u580	m36	SANDY	Who, me? Why should it?
L97290	u574	m36	JEFFREY	That doesn't bother you, does it?
L97289	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah?
L97288	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
L97287	u580	m36	SANDY	Did you see her undressed?
L97286	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes.
L97285	u580	m36	SANDY	Twice. Without her sensing anything?
L97284	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Actually. I've been in twice.
L97283	u580	m36	SANDY	You saw a lot in one night.
L97282	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
L97281	u580	m36	SANDY	Wow. Should you tell my father?
L97280	u574	m36	JEFFREY	"OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the ""yellow man"". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man."
L97279	u580	m36	SANDY	You want to tell me about it?
L97278	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No way. I'm about to blow up.
L97277	u580	m36	SANDY	You want a Dairy Queen?
L97276	u580	m36	SANDY	It's okay. Don't worry about it.
L97275	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'm sorry, I didn't...
L97274	u580	m36	SANDY	He got a little jealous.
L97273	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What's with Mike?
L97242	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
L97241	u580	m36	SANDY	What did you see?
L97240	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
L97239	u580	m36	SANDY	Well, how did it go? What happened?
L97027	u580	m36	SANDY	Okay, okay. Bye.
L97026	u574	m36	JEFFREY	That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
L97025	u580	m36	SANDY	I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
L97024	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay, thanks.
L97023	u580	m36	SANDY	I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
L97022	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Are you sure?
L97021	u580	m36	SANDY	I'm going to wait here until she comes.
L97020	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah.
L97019	u580	m36	SANDY	Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
L97018	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Look, it can wait till Sunday.
L97017	u580	m36	SANDY	Okay, yeah, call.
L97016	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Oh, okay, can I call?
L97015	u580	m36	SANDY	I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
L97014	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
L97013	u580	m36	SANDY	I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
L97012	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
L97011	u580	m36	SANDY	OK.
L97010	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
L97009	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah, but.
L97008	u574	m36	JEFFREY	It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
L97007	u580	m36	SANDY	It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
L97006	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Why not?
L97005	u580	m36	SANDY	Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
L97003	u580	m36	SANDY	I'll drink to that.
L97002	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Here's to. An interesting experience.
L96997	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Two.
L96996	u580	m36	SANDY	That sounds good.
L96990	u580	m36	SANDY	This is not my usual Friday night!
L96989	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
L96988	u580	m36	SANDY	Brilliant.
L96987	u574	m36	JEFFREY	First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
L96986	u580	m36	SANDY	What's the plan.
L96974	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
L96973	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
L96972	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
L96971	u580	m36	SANDY	"I already know. The ""Slow Club"". It's on Route 7."
L96970	u574	m36	JEFFREY	First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
L96969	u580	m36	SANDY	I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
L96968	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
L96967	u580	m36	SANDY	You really want to do this, don't you?
L96966	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
L96965	u580	m36	SANDY	Yes. I do.
L96964	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
L96963	u580	m36	SANDY	I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
L96962	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
L96961	u580	m36	SANDY	So, what's next?
L96959	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah.
L96958	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah, if it opens the door.
L96957	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
L96956	u580	m36	SANDY	No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
L96955	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
L96954	u580	m36	SANDY	I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
L96953	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
L96952	u580	m36	SANDY	Are you alright?
L96941	u580	m36	SANDY	Alright. Good luck, yourself.
L96940	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
L96939	u580	m36	SANDY	Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
L96938	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
L96937	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Let's go.
L96936	u580	m36	SANDY	Alright.
L96935	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
L96934	u580	m36	SANDY	You've got a point there.
L96933	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
L96932	u580	m36	SANDY	I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
L96931	u574	m36	JEFFREY	"You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"
L96930	u580	m36	SANDY	What will I say when she comes to the door?
L96929	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
L96928	u580	m36	SANDY	Now, how are you going to do that?
L96927	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
L96926	u580	m36	SANDY	It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
L96925	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
L96924	u580	m36	SANDY	You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
L96923	u574	m36	JEFFREY	There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
L96922	u580	m36	SANDY	Alright, now tell me. What is it?
L96921	u580	m36	SANDY	Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
L96920	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
L96919	u580	m36	SANDY	I'm here, aren't I?
L96918	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I don't want to cause any trouble.
L96916	u580	m36	SANDY	Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
L96915	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'd like to talk to you about something.
L96914	u580	m36	SANDY	I don't know.
L96913	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You hungry or thirsty, or both?
L96909	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah. Good bye.
L96908	u580	m36	SANDY	I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
L96907	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I guess I'll see you sometime.
L96906	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
L96905	u580	m36	SANDY	I've gotta go in.
L96904	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I don't know. He moved away.
L96903	u580	m36	SANDY	What happened to him?
L96902	u574	m36	JEFFREY	It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
L96901	u580	m36	SANDY	Still, it must be kinda rough.
L96900	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
L96899	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
L96898	u574	m36	JEFFREY	You really do hear a lot, don't you?
L96897	u580	m36	SANDY	My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
L96896	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
L96895	u580	m36	SANDY	I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
L96894	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
L96893	u580	m36	SANDY	I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
L96892	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Where are they?
L96891	u580	m36	SANDY	That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
L96890	u580	m36	SANDY	Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
L96889	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I guess you have to get back home soon?
L96888	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
L96887	u574	m36	JEFFREY	It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
L96886	u580	m36	SANDY	Maybe so.
L96885	u574	m36	JEFFREY	The ear is from a missing person maybe?
L96884	u580	m36	SANDY	No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
L96883	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
L96882	u580	m36	SANDY	There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
L96881	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
L96880	u580	m36	SANDY	I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
L96879	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
L96878	u580	m36	SANDY	Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
L96877	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What do you know about the ear? Anything?
L96876	u580	m36	SANDY	That's too bad.
L96875	u574	m36	JEFFREY	I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
L96874	u580	m36	SANDY	Yeah. What are you doing now?
L96873	u574	m36	JEFFREY	What else is new? Right?
L96872	u580	m36	SANDY	Terrible boring.
L96871	u574	m36	JEFFREY	How is Central these days?
L96870	u580	m36	SANDY	Yes.
L96869	u574	m36	JEFFREY	No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
L96868	u580	m36	SANDY	Am I bothering you?
L96867	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
L96866	u580	m36	SANDY	You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
L96865	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Oh yeah?
L96864	u580	m36	SANDY	I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
L96863	u574	m36	JEFFREY	Yeah, how did you know?
L97601	u575	m36	MIKE	You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
L97600	u580	m36	SANDY	Stop it Mike.
L97599	u575	m36	MIKE	Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
L97248	u580	m36	SANDY	Okay.
L97247	u575	m36	MIKE	Come on out a minute, okay?
L97246	u580	m36	SANDY	Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
L97245	u575	m36	MIKE	Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
L97234	u580	m36	SANDY	Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
L97233	u575	m36	MIKE	I don't know why we have to watch TV.
L97232	u580	m36	SANDY	You can change it if you want to.
L97231	u575	m36	MIKE	What are watchin' this junk for?
L96842	u575	m36	MIKE	Yeah, nice meetin' you.
L96841	u580	m36	SANDY	Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
L108448	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Bourne comes here? Why?
L108447	u612	m39	ABBOTT	He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
L108446	u615	m39	GRETKOV	What?
L108445	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Save it for Bourne.
L108444	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
L108443	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What do you mean?
L108442	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
L108381	u615	m39	GRETKOV	One last push. One.
L108380	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
L108378	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Anything else?
L108377	u612	m39	ABBOTT	She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
L108376	u615	m39	GRETKOV	And the Landy woman?
L108375	u612	m39	ABBOTT	No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
L108374	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Will it track back to us?
L108373	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
L108372	u615	m39	GRETKOV	There was a mistake.
L108371	u612	m39	ABBOTT	You told me Bourne was dead.
L108465	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
L108464	u623	m39	PAMELA	No. You lost your way.
L108463	u612	m39	ABBOTT	In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
L108462	u623	m39	PAMELA	No good options left?
L108461	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Had to be done.
L108460	u623	m39	PAMELA	And Danny Zorn, what was that?
L108459	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Why not? It was just money.
L108458	u623	m39	PAMELA	And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
L108457	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
L108456	u623	m39	PAMELA	'Why' would be enough for me.
L108455	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
L108454	u623	m39	PAMELA	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
L108453	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Sit down.
L108435	u623	m39	PAMELA	I'm sorry, Ward.
L108434	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
L108433	u623	m39	PAMELA	Don't know.
L108432	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
L108429	u612	m39	ABBOTT	No... It must have been Bourne.
L108428	u623	m39	PAMELA	Did he say anything to you?
L108427	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
L108426	u623	m39	PAMELA	They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
L108425	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What?
L108415	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
L108414	u623	m39	PAMELA	Sorry to wake you.
L108317	u623	m39	PAMELA	Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
L108316	u612	m39	ABBOTT	It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
L108315	u623	m39	PAMELA	So what's he doing? You believe him?
L108253	u612	m39	ABBOTT	There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
L108252	u623	m39	PAMELA	Don't you want answers?
L108251	u612	m39	ABBOTT	My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
L108250	u623	m39	PAMELA	Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
L108249	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
L108099	u623	m39	PAMELA	And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
L108098	u612	m39	ABBOTT	You don't know what you're getting into here.
L108097	u623	m39	PAMELA	I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
L108096	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Berlin!
L108062	u612	m39	ABBOTT	So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
L108061	u623	m39	PAMELA	What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
L108060	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
L108059	u623	m39	PAMELA	May I finish?
L108058	u612	m39	ABBOTT	We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
L108057	u623	m39	PAMELA	Excuse me.
L108056	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Do you know what his budget was?
L108055	u623	m39	PAMELA	...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
L108054	u623	m39	PAMELA	...this is Conklin's computer.
L108053	u623	m39	PAMELA	...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
L108044	u623	m39	PAMELA	I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
L108043	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
L108042	u623	m39	PAMELA	And Bourne? Where's he now?
L108041	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
L108040	u623	m39	PAMELA	So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
L108039	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
L108038	u623	m39	PAMELA	I want to know what happened.
L108037	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
L108036	u623	m39	PAMELA	Let's talk about Conklin.
L108035	u623	m39	PAMELA	He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
L108034	u612	m39	ABBOTT	To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
L108033	u623	m39	PAMELA	I want to know about Treadstone.
L108032	u612	m39	ABBOTT	And what are we looking for?
L108030	u612	m39	ABBOTT	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
L108029	u623	m39	PAMELA	That's not gonna fly.
L108028	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Never heard of it.
L108027	u623	m39	PAMELA	Treadstone.
L108339	u627	m39	ZORN	Okay... 
L108338	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Show me again...
L108337	u627	m39	ZORN	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
L108336	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Who else knows about this?
L108335	u627	m39	ZORN	Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
L108334	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Lots of people...
L108333	u627	m39	ZORN	Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
L108332	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Keep going...
L108331	u627	m39	ZORN	Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
L108330	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Jesus...
L108329	u627	m39	ZORN	Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
L108328	u612	m39	ABBOTT	It was staged?
L108327	u627	m39	ZORN	There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
L108326	u612	m39	ABBOTT	And?
L108325	u627	m39	ZORN	You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
L108324	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What do you have, Danny?
L108323	u627	m39	ZORN	I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
L108322	u627	m39	ZORN	The sooner the better.
L108321	u612	m39	ABBOTT	She say what time I should call?
L108319	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Thanks.
L108318	u627	m39	ZORN	Sir...
L108515	u613	m39	BOURNE	I'm sorry.
L108514	u616	m39	IRENA	Is this really happening?
L108513	u613	m39	BOURNE	I have to go now.
L108512	u613	m39	BOURNE	No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
L108511	u616	m39	IRENA	Because you're afraid!
L108510	u613	m39	BOURNE	I can't let you do that either.
L108509	u616	m39	IRENA	I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
L108508	u613	m39	BOURNE	Look at me.
L108507	u616	m39	IRENA	YOU'RE A LIAR!
L108506	u613	m39	BOURNE	You know I'm not.
L108505	u616	m39	IRENA	You're a liar.
L108504	u613	m39	BOURNE	It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
L108502	u613	m39	BOURNE	I don't want you to forgive me.
L108501	u616	m39	IRENA	How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
L108500	u613	m39	BOURNE	They loved you.  And I killed them.
L108499	u616	m39	IRENA	You killed them.
L108498	u613	m39	BOURNE	It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
L108497	u613	m39	BOURNE	I killed them.
L108496	u616	m39	IRENA	Then what?
L108495	u613	m39	BOURNE	That's not what happened to your parents.
L108494	u616	m39	IRENA	Yes...
L108493	u613	m39	BOURNE	It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
L108491	u616	m39	IRENA	What?
L108490	u613	m39	BOURNE	I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
L108489	u616	m39	IRENA	No, I do.
L108488	u613	m39	BOURNE	No. It's because you don't know how they died.
L108487	u616	m39	IRENA	It's nothing. It's just a picture.
L108486	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
L108485	u616	m39	IRENA	Okay.
L108484	u613	m39	BOURNE	Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
L108482	u616	m39	IRENA	I speak English.
L108481	u613	m39	BOURNE	Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
L108193	u618	m39	JARDA	-- take the back -- get another car --
L108192	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- what? --
L108191	u618	m39	JARDA	-- my coat -- but we should --
L108190	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- car keys?
L108184	u613	m39	BOURNE	How long? How long do I have -- 
L108183	u618	m39	JARDA	I'm sorry.
L108182	u613	m39	BOURNE	You called it in?
L108179	u613	m39	BOURNE	I did.
L108178	u618	m39	JARDA	She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
L108176	u618	m39	JARDA	I don't know! Why would I lie?
L108175	u613	m39	BOURNE	What's going on in Berlin?
L108174	u618	m39	JARDA	I don't know who that is.
L108173	u613	m39	BOURNE	Pamela Landy?
L108172	u618	m39	JARDA	A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
L108171	u613	m39	BOURNE	Who sent you to Greece?
L108170	u618	m39	JARDA	I don't know.
L108169	u613	m39	BOURNE	You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
L108166	u618	m39	JARDA	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
L108165	u613	m39	BOURNE	Try again.
L108164	u618	m39	JARDA	He's dead.
L108163	u613	m39	BOURNE	Conklin.
L108162	u618	m39	JARDA	What do you want?
L108161	u613	m39	BOURNE	She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
L108160	u618	m39	JARDA	So why didn't you kill me then?
L108158	u618	m39	JARDA	I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
L108157	u613	m39	BOURNE	You still should've moved.
L108155	u618	m39	JARDA	Sorry. Old habits.
L108154	u613	m39	BOURNE	Front. Use your teeth.
L108152	u613	m39	BOURNE	Drop it.
L108151	u618	m39	JARDA	Felt a little light.
L108150	u613	m39	BOURNE	I emptied it.
L108413	u619	m39	MARIE	Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
L108412	u613	m39	BOURNE	God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
L108411	u613	m39	BOURNE	I only dream about people who are dead.
L108410	u619	m39	MARIE	You do?
L108409	u613	m39	BOURNE	I know it's a dream.
L108408	u613	m39	BOURNE	It might have.
L108407	u619	m39	MARIE	It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
L108406	u613	m39	BOURNE	I did.
L108405	u619	m39	MARIE	But you found another choice.
L108404	u613	m39	BOURNE	I wanted to kill him.
L107970	u613	m39	BOURNE	Tell me later.
L107969	u619	m39	MARIE	I love you, too.
L107967	u613	m39	BOURNE	There's no choice.
L107966	u619	m39	MARIE	Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
L107965	u613	m39	BOURNE	I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
L107964	u619	m39	MARIE	There must be another way!
L107963	u613	m39	BOURNE	If he crosses the bridge, it is.
L107962	u619	m39	MARIE	What if it's not who you think it is?
L107961	u613	m39	BOURNE	I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
L107960	u619	m39	MARIE	Where are you going?
L107959	u613	m39	BOURNE	You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
L107958	u619	m39	MARIE	-- hang on --
L107957	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
L107956	u619	m39	MARIE	-- it's just him? --
L107955	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- not yet --
L107954	u619	m39	MARIE	Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
L107953	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
L107952	u619	m39	MARIE	-- where? -
L107951	u613	m39	BOURNE	Switch! You drive!
L107950	u619	m39	MARIE	What?
L107949	u613	m39	BOURNE	You drive.
L107948	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
L107947	u619	m39	MARIE	-- where's left to go? --
L107946	u613	m39	BOURNE	Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
L107945	u619	m39	MARIE	I don't want to move again... I like it here.
L107944	u613	m39	BOURNE	We can't wait to be sure.
L107943	u619	m39	MARIE	...but you're not -- you're not sure...
L107942	u613	m39	BOURNE	Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
L107941	u619	m39	MARIE	Where --
L107940	u613	m39	BOURNE	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
L107939	u619	m39	MARIE	That's crazy.
L107938	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
L107937	u619	m39	MARIE	So...
L107936	u613	m39	BOURNE	He was at the campground yesterday.
L107935	u619	m39	MARIE	But you're sure?
L107934	u613	m39	BOURNE	We pushed it. We got lazy.
L107933	u619	m39	MARIE	But we were so careful.
L107932	u613	m39	BOURNE	The Telegraph office.
L107931	u619	m39	MARIE	No... How?
L107926	u619	m39	MARIE	One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
L107925	u613	m39	BOURNE	But it ends up the same.
L107924	u619	m39	MARIE	You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
L107923	u613	m39	BOURNE	I should be better by now.
L107922	u619	m39	MARIE	Sleep. Sleep now.
L107921	u619	m39	MARIE	I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
L107920	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's just a nightmare.
L107919	u619	m39	MARIE	I worry when you get like this.
L107918	u613	m39	BOURNE	I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
L107917	u613	m39	BOURNE	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
L107916	u619	m39	MARIE	We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
L107915	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
L107914	u619	m39	MARIE	-- it hasn't been two years --
L107913	u613	m39	BOURNE	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
L107912	u619	m39	MARIE	You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
L107911	u613	m39	BOURNE	No. There's nothing new.
L107910	u619	m39	MARIE	I'll get the book.
L107909	u613	m39	BOURNE	Conklin up front.
L107908	u619	m39	MARIE	Where were you, Jason? In the car.
L108312	u622	m39	NICKY	...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
L108311	u613	m39	BOURNE	I was here!
L108310	u622	m39	NICKY	No... Jason... please...
L108309	u622	m39	NICKY	You never worked Berlin...
L108308	u613	m39	BOURNE	That's a lie!
L108307	u622	m39	NICKY	Your first assignment was Geneva.
L108306	u613	m39	BOURNE	My first job.
L108305	u622	m39	NICKY	No. You never worked Berlin.
L108304	u613	m39	BOURNE	For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
L108303	u622	m39	NICKY	What do you mean?
L108302	u613	m39	BOURNE	So when was I here?
L108301	u622	m39	NICKY	He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
L108300	u613	m39	BOURNE	Abbott?
L108299	u622	m39	NICKY	Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
L108298	u613	m39	BOURNE	Why are you here, then?
L108296	u622	m39	NICKY	Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
L108295	u613	m39	BOURNE	What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
L108293	u613	m39	BOURNE	I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
L108292	u622	m39	NICKY	You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
L108291	u613	m39	BOURNE	I killed him???
L108290	u622	m39	NICKY	And you got to him before we could.
L108289	u613	m39	BOURNE	Last week? When?
L108288	u622	m39	NICKY	It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
L108287	u613	m39	BOURNE	A Russian?
L108286	u622	m39	NICKY	Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
L108285	u613	m39	BOURNE	Say it.
L108284	u613	m39	BOURNE	I want to hear it from you.
L108283	u622	m39	NICKY	What is this, a game?
L108282	u613	m39	BOURNE	How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
L108280	u622	m39	NICKY	They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
L108279	u613	m39	BOURNE	Why is she trying to kill me?
L108275	u613	m39	BOURNE	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
L108274	u622	m39	NICKY	You hear me? I believed you.
L108273	u613	m39	BOURNE	Who is Pamela Landy?
L108272	u622	m39	NICKY	I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
L108265	u613	m39	BOURNE	Get on it.
L108264	u622	m39	NICKY	Yes.
L108263	u613	m39	BOURNE	See that tram coming around the corner?
L108531	u623	m39	PAMELA	Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
L108530	u613	m39	BOURNE	You didn't answer my question.
L108529	u623	m39	PAMELA	Sounds like a threat.
L108528	u613	m39	BOURNE	Don't need it. I remember everything.
L108526	u623	m39	PAMELA	Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
L108525	u613	m39	BOURNE	What's that?
L108524	u623	m39	PAMELA	Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
L108522	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are you disappointed?
L108521	u613	m39	BOURNE	Why am I alive?
L108520	u623	m39	PAMELA	Careful...
L108519	u613	m39	BOURNE	Oh, shit...
L108518	u623	m39	PAMELA	Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
L108517	u613	m39	BOURNE	Where am I?
L108246	u613	m39	BOURNE	Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
L108245	u623	m39	PAMELA	Okay, Jason, your move.
L108242	u613	m39	BOURNE	There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
L108241	u623	m39	PAMELA	Who?
L108240	u613	m39	BOURNE	I want someone I know to take me in.
L108239	u623	m39	PAMELA	Okay, how do you want to do it?
L108238	u613	m39	BOURNE	I want to come in.
L108237	u623	m39	PAMELA	What do you want?
L108236	u623	m39	PAMELA	Bourne?
L108235	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's me.
L108441	u614	m39	CRONIN	Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
L108440	u623	m39	PAMELA	What? The tapes?
L108439	u614	m39	CRONIN	You're sure?
L108431	u614	m39	CRONIN	But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
L108430	u623	m39	PAMELA	We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
L108370	u623	m39	PAMELA	This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
L108369	u614	m39	CRONIN	What?
L108368	u623	m39	PAMELA	Alright... take it down.
L108357	u623	m39	PAMELA	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
L108356	u614	m39	CRONIN	Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
L108348	u623	m39	PAMELA	-- the hotel -- how far? --
L108347	u614	m39	CRONIN	-- go -- take the van! --
L108102	u623	m39	PAMELA	-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
L108101	u614	m39	CRONIN	-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
L108072	u623	m39	PAMELA	Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
L108071	u614	m39	CRONIN	There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
L108070	u623	m39	PAMELA	Who's going? Us?
L108069	u614	m39	CRONIN	Looks like he's been detained.
L108012	u623	m39	PAMELA	And the Germans can't match it?
L108011	u614	m39	CRONIN	-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
L108010	u614	m39	CRONIN	I'm working on it.
L108009	u623	m39	PAMELA	We need to get in there.
L107999	u626	m39	VIC	-- shut up! -- just shut the --
L107998	u617	m39	IVAN	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
L107997	u626	m39	VIC	-- who? -- who else is here? --
L107995	u617	m39	IVAN	Is there. Is all there.
L107994	u626	m39	VIC	This is everything? Is there.
L107993	u617	m39	IVAN	Now. Show now.
L107992	u626	m39	VIC	Here?
L107991	u617	m39	IVAN	Show me.
L108066	u623	m39	PAMELA	I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
L108065	u620	m39	MARSHALL	Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
L107985	u623	m39	PAMELA	For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
L107984	u620	m39	MARSHALL	Still...
L107983	u623	m39	PAMELA	We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
L107982	u620	m39	MARSHALL	It's a lot of money, Pam.
L107981	u623	m39	PAMELA	That's where we came out.
L107980	u620	m39	MARSHALL	I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
L108095	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
L108094	u621	m39	NEVINS/PHONE	Yes, sir -- ma'am...
L108093	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
L108092	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
L108091	u621	m39	NEVINS/PHONE	Me? Four years.
L108090	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	How long have you worked for the agency?
L108086	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
L108085	u621	m39	NEVINS/PHONE	Who's this?
L108084	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	Mr. Nevins?
L108535	u623	m39	PAMELA	Felt promising. It's a start.
L108534	u622	m39	NICKY	So?
L108533	u623	m39	PAMELA	Let's give him half an hour.
L108256	u623	m39	PAMELA	Alright...
L108255	u622	m39	NICKY	I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
L108254	u623	m39	PAMELA	What do you think? Is he coming in?
L108231	u622	m39	NICKY	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
L108230	u623	m39	PAMELA	Is it fresh?
L108204	u622	m39	NICKY	Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
L108203	u623	m39	PAMELA	And why is that?
L108202	u622	m39	NICKY	I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
L108136	u623	m39	PAMELA	See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
L108135	u622	m39	NICKY	What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
L108134	u623	m39	PAMELA	Some women like Dobermans --
L108133	u622	m39	NICKY	These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
L108132	u623	m39	PAMELA	Did you?
L108131	u622	m39	NICKY	You mean, did I want a date?
L108130	u623	m39	PAMELA	You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
L108129	u622	m39	NICKY	You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
L108128	u623	m39	PAMELA	Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
L108127	u622	m39	NICKY	If you say so.
L108126	u623	m39	PAMELA	So he fooled you.
L108125	u622	m39	NICKY	I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
L108124	u623	m39	PAMELA	Believed what?
L108123	u622	m39	NICKY	Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
L108122	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are you an expert in amnesia?
L108121	u622	m39	NICKY	Am I a doctor, no, but...
L108120	u623	m39	PAMELA	I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
L108119	u623	m39	PAMELA	You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
L108118	u622	m39	NICKY	Good luck.
L108114	u622	m39	NICKY	Before this? Before Bourne? No.
L108113	u623	m39	PAMELA	Amnesia?
L108112	u622	m39	NICKY	Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
L108111	u623	m39	PAMELA	What kind of problems?
L108393	u623	m39	PAMELA	And what about you, anything?
L108392	u625	m39	TEDDY	Yes. In that order.
L108391	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are we hacking or asking?
L108390	u625	m39	TEDDY	We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
L108387	u623	m39	PAMELA	Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
L108386	u625	m39	TEDDY	His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
L108385	u623	m39	PAMELA	By who?
L108384	u625	m39	TEDDY	Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
L108355	u623	m39	PAMELA	Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
L108354	u625	m39	TEDDY	Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
L108224	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are we locked up?
L108223	u625	m39	TEDDY	No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
L108222	u623	m39	PAMELA	Anything?
L108018	u623	m39	PAMELA	"What the hell is a ""Treadstone?"""
L108017	u625	m39	TEDDY	Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
L108016	u623	m39	PAMELA	Do we know what this says?
L117640	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
L117639	u643	m41	ANDREA	What?
L117638	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
L117637	u643	m41	ANDREA	Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
L117635	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
L117634	u643	m41	ANDREA	What is it?
L117633	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
L117630	u643	m41	ANDREA	I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
L117629	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
L118342	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
L118341	u643	m41	ANDREA	No dances, just tell me.
L118162	u643	m41	ANDREA	So what did you find.
L118161	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
L117772	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
L117771	u643	m41	ANDREA	Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
L117707	u643	m41	ANDREA	How soon?...
L117706	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
L117705	u643	m41	ANDREA	Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
L117704	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	You'd be surprised how often they are.
L117703	u643	m41	ANDREA	Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
L117702	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
L117701	u643	m41	ANDREA	But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
L117700	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
L117699	u643	m41	ANDREA	But you must have something to go on?
L117698	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
L117697	u643	m41	ANDREA	And the bad news?
L117696	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
L117668	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
L117667	u643	m41	ANDREA	Why? What for?
L117666	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
L117665	u643	m41	ANDREA	Anything.
L117664	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
L117663	u643	m41	ANDREA	Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
L117653	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
L117652	u643	m41	ANDREA	Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
L117651	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
L118302	u646	m41	EVAN	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
L118301	u643	m41	ANDREA	Just. Like. Jason.
L118300	u646	m41	EVAN	You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
L118299	u643	m41	ANDREA	How. Did you. Know that?
L118298	u646	m41	EVAN	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
L118297	u643	m41	ANDREA	You're. Acting. Like your father.
L118292	u646	m41	EVAN	I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
L118291	u643	m41	ANDREA	Fix?
L118290	u646	m41	EVAN	There must be a way to fix this.
L118167	u646	m41	EVAN	He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
L118166	u643	m41	ANDREA	What does that mean for Evan?
L118158	u643	m41	ANDREA	Cute, Evan.
L118157	u646	m41	EVAN	Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
L118105	u643	m41	ANDREA	Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
L118104	u646	m41	EVAN	Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
L118103	u643	m41	ANDREA	I found these. The others are still in storage.
L118101	u646	m41	EVAN	How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
L118100	u643	m41	ANDREA	I don't know. These things take time.
L118099	u646	m41	EVAN	How long will I be in here?
L118098	u643	m41	ANDREA	...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
L117926	u646	m41	EVAN	What? What could he do?
L117925	u643	m41	ANDREA	And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
L117924	u646	m41	EVAN	Sure...
L117923	u643	m41	ANDREA	I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
L117922	u643	m41	ANDREA	When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
L117921	u646	m41	EVAN	No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
L117920	u643	m41	ANDREA	Why do you ask?
L117919	u646	m41	EVAN	Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
L117918	u643	m41	ANDREA	Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
L117917	u646	m41	EVAN	Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
L117916	u643	m41	ANDREA	I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
L117915	u646	m41	EVAN	Please, mom. People will talk.
L117750	u643	m41	ANDREA	Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
L117749	u646	m41	EVAN	I... I blacked out.
L117748	u643	m41	ANDREA	Something must've happened! What set him off?
L117747	u646	m41	EVAN	I don't know... I don't remember.
L117711	u646	m41	EVAN	Okay.
L117710	u643	m41	ANDREA	Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
L117676	u646	m41	EVAN	I... I don't remember.
L117675	u643	m41	ANDREA	Honey. What were you doing with that?
L117674	u646	m41	EVAN	What happened?
L117671	u643	m41	ANDREA	Great. I'll see you soon.
L117670	u646	m41	EVAN	These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
L117660	u646	m41	EVAN	My father has a bad memory, too?
L117659	u643	m41	ANDREA	That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
L117656	u643	m41	ANDREA	You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
L117655	u646	m41	EVAN	I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
L117625	u643	m41	ANDREA	Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
L117624	u646	m41	EVAN	No.
L117623	u643	m41	ANDREA	I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
L117622	u646	m41	EVAN	All the dads are gonna be there.
L117620	u646	m41	EVAN	But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
L117619	u643	m41	ANDREA	We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
L117618	u646	m41	EVAN	Can't he come out for one day?
L117617	u643	m41	ANDREA	You know the answer to that.
L117616	u646	m41	EVAN	Um... can dad come this time?
L117615	u643	m41	ANDREA	Darn it!
L117614	u643	m41	ANDREA	Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
L117613	u646	m41	EVAN	Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
L117612	u646	m41	EVAN	We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
L117611	u643	m41	ANDREA	When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
L117610	u646	m41	EVAN	We're gonna be late again.
L118133	u646	m41	EVAN	So you believe me?
L118132	u644	m41	CARLOS	Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
L118131	u646	m41	EVAN	What did you see? What did it look like?
L118125	u646	m41	EVAN	Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
L118124	u644	m41	CARLOS	Weirder than this?
L118123	u646	m41	EVAN	Just tell me if anything weird happens.
L118120	u644	m41	CARLOS	You need to see the prison shrink, man.
L118119	u646	m41	EVAN	So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
L118117	u646	m41	EVAN	I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
L118116	u644	m41	CARLOS	Shit. I knew you were crazy.
L118115	u646	m41	EVAN	Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
L118114	u644	m41	CARLOS	Straight up.
L118113	u646	m41	EVAN	"You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about ""the Lord works in mysterious ways?"""
L118097	u644	m41	CARLOS	Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
L118096	u646	m41	EVAN	Can you protect me?
L118095	u644	m41	CARLOS	Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
L118339	u646	m41	EVAN	Photos?
L118338	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
L118337	u646	m41	EVAN	But I... I need those books.
L118336	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
L118334	u646	m41	EVAN	My journals! Where are they?
L118333	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Books?
L118332	u646	m41	EVAN	Where are my goddamn books?
L118331	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
L118164	u646	m41	EVAN	Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
L118163	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
L118160	u646	m41	EVAN	Are you sure? Not even with my father?
L118159	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
L117765	u646	m41	EVAN	It's coming... argh! I can't!
L117764	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
L117763	u646	m41	EVAN	I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
L117762	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
L117760	u646	m41	EVAN	I see a car.
L117759	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
L117758	u646	m41	EVAN	No, protecting her.
L117757	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Are you hurting her?
L117756	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
L117755	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Where are you now?
L117754	u646	m41	EVAN	Yes.
L117753	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
L117709	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Not in this wing, actually. No.
L117708	u646	m41	EVAN	Dad lives here?
L117658	u646	m41	EVAN	You know my father?
L117657	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
L118241	u655	m41	THUMPER	Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
L118240	u646	m41	EVAN	Get out. Both of you.
L118023	u655	m41	THUMPER	Fuck off, frat boy.
L118022	u646	m41	EVAN	Huh?
L118021	u655	m41	THUMPER	Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
L117933	u655	m41	THUMPER	Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
L117932	u646	m41	EVAN	What?
L117931	u655	m41	THUMPER	Are you stupid or what?
L117930	u646	m41	EVAN	Shhh! I need quiet for this.
L117929	u655	m41	THUMPER	What the fuck are you doing?
L117928	u646	m41	EVAN	I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
L117897	u646	m41	EVAN	All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
L117896	u655	m41	THUMPER	You really think he wanted to kill you?
L117855	u655	m41	THUMPER	That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
L117854	u646	m41	EVAN	Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
L117851	u655	m41	THUMPER	Like Ozzy.
L117850	u646	m41	EVAN	It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
L117842	u646	m41	EVAN	This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
L117841	u655	m41	THUMPER	I thought you were a December baby.
L117840	u646	m41	EVAN	Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
L118280	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
L118279	u646	m41	EVAN	Then you think it might have worked out?
L118278	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
L118277	u646	m41	EVAN	And...?
L118276	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's crossed my mind from time to time.
L118275	u646	m41	EVAN	I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
L118274	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
L118273	u646	m41	EVAN	I don't get it.
L118272	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
L118271	u646	m41	EVAN	I was?
L118270	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
L118269	u646	m41	EVAN	"Kayleigh? Do you ever think about ""us?"" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?"
L118268	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
L118267	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Is something the matter?
L118266	u646	m41	EVAN	He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
L118265	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
L118253	u646	m41	EVAN	Stop! Take me back!
L118252	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
L118251	u646	m41	EVAN	Where are we going?
L118238	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
L118237	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
L118236	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
L118235	u646	m41	EVAN	Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
L118234	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Sure you don't want your wallet?
L118233	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
L118232	u646	m41	EVAN	Which is?
L118231	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	There's one major hole in your story.
L118230	u646	m41	EVAN	That I didn't leave you there to rot.
L118229	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Know what?
L118228	u646	m41	EVAN	I just thought you should know.
L118226	u646	m41	EVAN	Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
L118225	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
L118224	u646	m41	EVAN	Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
L118223	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh? There's proof now?
L118222	u646	m41	EVAN	I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
L118221	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
L118220	u646	m41	EVAN	I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
L118219	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
L118218	u646	m41	EVAN	Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
L118217	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
L118216	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah?
L118215	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
L118214	u646	m41	EVAN	Different? How?
L118213	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Because you're... different.
L118212	u646	m41	EVAN	Why's that?
L118211	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
L118210	u646	m41	EVAN	"You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying."
L118209	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	What's happened to you?
L118208	u646	m41	EVAN	The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
L118207	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Ha! Where's that?
L118206	u646	m41	EVAN	No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
L118205	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
L118204	u646	m41	EVAN	I get it. You can drop it now.
L118203	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
L118197	u646	m41	EVAN	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
L118196	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
L118147	u646	m41	EVAN	Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
L118146	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
L118145	u646	m41	EVAN	I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
L118091	u646	m41	EVAN	He's a fucking maniac!
L118090	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
L118080	u646	m41	EVAN	What?
L118079	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
L118078	u646	m41	EVAN	I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
L118077	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
L118076	u646	m41	EVAN	I walk differently?
L118075	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
L118074	u646	m41	EVAN	Like how?
L118073	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
L118072	u646	m41	EVAN	What do you mean?
L118071	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Are you okay?
L118069	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
L118068	u646	m41	EVAN	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
L118067	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
L118066	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
L118065	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
L118064	u646	m41	EVAN	Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
L118063	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
L118055	u646	m41	EVAN	Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
L118054	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Why are you doing all this for me?
L118053	u646	m41	EVAN	Go on. Sit down.
L118052	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
L118051	u646	m41	EVAN	You'll see.
L118050	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I don't understand, where are you taking me?
L118043	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
L118042	u646	m41	EVAN	What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
L118039	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
L118038	u646	m41	EVAN	So it didn't feel... weird?
L118037	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
L118015	u646	m41	EVAN	I dunno.  Just being weird.
L118014	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
L118013	u646	m41	EVAN	Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
L118006	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Those are your clothes, silly.
L118005	u646	m41	EVAN	Where... where are my clothes?
L118004	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
L118003	u646	m41	EVAN	Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
L117969	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
L117968	u646	m41	EVAN	You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
L117967	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
L117962	u646	m41	EVAN	No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
L117961	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
L117960	u646	m41	EVAN	I know, but...
L117959	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It was a long time ago.
L117958	u646	m41	EVAN	It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
L117957	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	What do you want to know, Evan?
L117956	u646	m41	EVAN	When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
L117955	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
L117954	u646	m41	EVAN	Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
L117953	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Of course.
L117952	u646	m41	EVAN	Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
L117951	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Me? Are you kidding? Why?
L117950	u646	m41	EVAN	Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
L117949	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
L117948	u646	m41	EVAN	Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
L117947	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Not if you remember my dad.
L117946	u646	m41	EVAN	Wow. That must've taken some courage.
L117945	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
L117943	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
L117942	u646	m41	EVAN	So how's Tommy?
L117941	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I've stopped a hundred times.
L117940	u646	m41	EVAN	Not since we were kids.
L117939	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
L117938	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
L117937	u646	m41	EVAN	Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
L117936	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
L117815	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Hi, Lenny.
L117814	u646	m41	EVAN	Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
L117809	u646	m41	EVAN	He must be. They're letting him go, right?
L117808	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
L117807	u646	m41	EVAN	Duck, here they come.
L117806	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
L117805	u646	m41	EVAN	I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
L117795	u646	m41	EVAN	What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
L117794	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I deserve a lot worse.
L117793	u646	m41	EVAN	Damn. Your dad did this?
L117792	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
L117791	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm sorry.
L117790	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Ouch.
L117787	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You really don't remember anything that happened?
L117786	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
L117743	u646	m41	EVAN	Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
L117742	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh God... what did we do?
L117722	u646	m41	EVAN	So let's go. This place creeps me out.
L117721	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
L118326	u646	m41	EVAN	Been there, done that.
L118325	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
L118324	u646	m41	EVAN	And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
L118323	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
L117995	u646	m41	EVAN	Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
L117994	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	...yes.
L117993	u646	m41	EVAN	Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
L117992	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Who -- who are you?
L117991	u646	m41	EVAN	It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
L117990	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
L117989	u646	m41	EVAN	Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
L117988	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
L117987	u646	m41	EVAN	What time is it?
L117694	u646	m41	EVAN	Kayleigh? What happened?
L117693	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
L117692	u646	m41	EVAN	I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
L117691	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Calm down, kid. Stand still.
L117690	u646	m41	EVAN	Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
L117687	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
L117686	u646	m41	EVAN	We're really gonna be in a movie!?
L118184	u646	m41	EVAN	Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
L118183	u649	m41	JASON	You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
L118182	u646	m41	EVAN	Who's to say you can't make things better?
L118181	u649	m41	JASON	"There is no ""right"". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."
L118180	u646	m41	EVAN	But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
L118179	u649	m41	JASON	I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
L118178	u646	m41	EVAN	Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
L118177	u649	m41	JASON	Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
L117713	u646	m41	EVAN	Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
L117712	u649	m41	JASON	It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
L118036	u648	m41	HUNTER	I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
L118035	u646	m41	EVAN	Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
L118034	u648	m41	HUNTER	Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
L118033	u646	m41	EVAN	You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
L118032	u648	m41	HUNTER	Me neither.
L118031	u646	m41	EVAN	We'll find out soon enough.
L118030	u648	m41	HUNTER	Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
L118028	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
L118027	u646	m41	EVAN	Evan Treborn.
L118026	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	And you are...?
L118025	u646	m41	EVAN	I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
L118024	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
L117914	u646	m41	EVAN	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
L117913	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Just don't drop the ball, okay?
L117912	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
L117911	u646	m41	EVAN	Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
L117910	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
L117834	u646	m41	EVAN	Hey, I got no choice.
L117833	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
L117832	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
L117884	u647	m41	HEIDI	Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
L117883	u646	m41	EVAN	It didn't feel like a dream.
L117875	u646	m41	EVAN	It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
L117874	u647	m41	HEIDI	Come on, go on...
L117871	u647	m41	HEIDI	Deal. Now read me something.
L117870	u646	m41	EVAN	"Freeze! No ""worm-boy"". No ""Mr. Worm,"" and no ""Worm-Master-General!"" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?"
L117867	u647	m41	HEIDI	Wow... read something.
L117866	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
L117865	u647	m41	HEIDI	Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
L117863	u647	m41	HEIDI	You're kidding. He's so... big.
L117862	u646	m41	EVAN	Thumper had a busy afternoon.
L117861	u647	m41	HEIDI	Smells like sex in here.
L117857	u646	m41	EVAN	Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
L117856	u647	m41	HEIDI	So what's the point?
L118312	u646	m41	EVAN	If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
L118311	u651	m41	LENNY	Destroy it?
L118310	u646	m41	EVAN	Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
L118309	u651	m41	LENNY	What?
L118308	u646	m41	EVAN	Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
L118307	u651	m41	LENNY	What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
L118305	u646	m41	EVAN	My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
L118304	u651	m41	LENNY	Are you sure you even packed it?
L118262	u646	m41	EVAN	Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
L118261	u651	m41	LENNY	Uh, we should be getting to class now.
L118174	u646	m41	EVAN	Y... yes. I guess I did.
L118173	u651	m41	LENNY	You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
L117891	u651	m41	LENNY	Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
L117890	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
L117889	u651	m41	LENNY	I couldn't cut the rope.
L117736	u651	m41	LENNY	Gee, thanks friend.
L117735	u646	m41	EVAN	That should buy you ten minutes at least.
L117650	u646	m41	EVAN	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
L117649	u651	m41	LENNY	Can... can... Can I have this?
L118296	u656	m41	TOMMY	I think I'll go check out the chapel.
L118295	u646	m41	EVAN	Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
L118288	u656	m41	TOMMY	Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
L118287	u646	m41	EVAN	Lung cancer?
L118260	u646	m41	EVAN	Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
L118259	u656	m41	TOMMY	I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
L118153	u646	m41	EVAN	I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
L118152	u656	m41	TOMMY	Listen to me good, Evan...
L118089	u656	m41	TOMMY	"Right, Evan. I believe you just said ""sick fuck."""
L118088	u646	m41	EVAN	No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
L118087	u656	m41	TOMMY	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
L118086	u646	m41	EVAN	What the hell are you doing?
L118083	u656	m41	TOMMY	"Get this ""us"" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself."
L118082	u646	m41	EVAN	Leave us alone you sick fuck!
L117823	u646	m41	EVAN	What's wrong with you?!
L117822	u656	m41	TOMMY	Look what you made me do!
L117741	u646	m41	EVAN	What happened?? Where are we?!
L117740	u656	m41	TOMMY	Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
L117720	u656	m41	TOMMY	Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
L117719	u646	m41	EVAN	Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
L117647	u656	m41	TOMMY	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
L117646	u646	m41	EVAN	Hey, what'd you do that for?
L118191	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Sorry. Never heard of her.
L118190	u646	m41	EVAN	None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
L118189	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Meant no offense.
L118188	u646	m41	EVAN	I come from a big family.
L118187	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
L118186	u646	m41	EVAN	Huh?
L118185	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Just get out, didja?
L118085	u656	m41	TOMMY	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
L118084	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Shut up, Tommy!
L117906	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh my God oh my God...
L117905	u656	m41	TOMMY	Lenny? Come on!
L117775	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I'm sorry.
L117774	u656	m41	TOMMY	Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
L117729	u656	m41	TOMMY	Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
L117728	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
L117727	u656	m41	TOMMY	What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
L117685	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
L117684	u656	m41	TOMMY	I thought I was the bad guy!
L117683	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
L117682	u656	m41	TOMMY	I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
L117681	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
L117900	u656	m41	TOMMY	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
L117899	u651	m41	LENNY	Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
L117733	u651	m41	LENNY	Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
L117732	u656	m41	TOMMY	The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
L117731	u651	m41	LENNY	What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
L117730	u656	m41	TOMMY	Here you go, buddy.
L117643	u656	m41	TOMMY	You're such a retard!
L117642	u651	m41	LENNY	You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
L169012	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
L169011	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	GOOD MORNING!
L169010	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Are you AFRAID?
L169009	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	GOOD MORNING!
L169008	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
L169007	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	Good MORNING!
L169006	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""
L169005	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	Good morning...
L169004	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Good morning, mongrels!
L169319	u778	m50	DAVID	Did you know him?
L169318	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah.
L169317	u778	m50	DAVID	I feel bad for his family.
L169316	u778	m50	DAVID	Donnie. Donnie Darko.
L169315	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What was his name?
L169314	u778	m50	DAVID	He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
L169313	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What happened?
L169312	u778	m50	DAVID	Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
L169311	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Hi... what's going on here?
L169122	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
L169121	u779	m50	DONNIE	Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
L169120	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
L169119	u779	m50	DONNIE	If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
L169118	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	I'm not following you.
L169117	u779	m50	DONNIE	If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
L169116	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
L169115	u779	m50	DONNIE	Could these wormholes appear in nature?
L169114	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
L169113	u779	m50	DONNIE	Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
L169112	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Beg pardon?
L169111	u779	m50	DONNIE	Like a spear.
L169110	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
L169070	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
L169069	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
L169068	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
L168915	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	A metal craft of any kind.
L168914	u779	m50	DONNIE	Like a DeLorean.
L168913	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
L168912	u779	m50	DONNIE	So... that's it?
L168911	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
L168910	u779	m50	DONNIE	-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
L168909	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Theoretically.
L168908	u779	m50	DONNIE	So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
L168907	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
L168906	u779	m50	DONNIE	I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
L168905	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Donnie.
L168904	u779	m50	DONNIE	Dr. Monnitoff?
L168711	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	Donnie! Give it back!
L168710	u779	m50	DONNIE	The Last Unicorn! By Samantha Darko.
L168655	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
L168654	u779	m50	DONNIE	What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
L168636	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	I'm telling Mom.
L168635	u779	m50	DONNIE	When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
L168634	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
L168575	u779	m50	DONNIE	Not until like... eighth grade.
L168574	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	When can I squeeze one out?
L169288	u779	m50	DONNIE	Our saviour...
L169287	u795	m50	SETH	What did you say?
L169286	u779	m50	DONNIE	Dea ex machina...
L168955	u795	m50	SETH	You know what? I think that you did it.
L168954	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
L168953	u795	m50	SETH	That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
L168952	u779	m50	DONNIE	I didn't say shit.
L168951	u795	m50	SETH	Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
L169091	u784	m50	FRANK	You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
L169090	u779	m50	DONNIE	How much longer is this gonna last?
L169089	u784	m50	FRANK	It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
L169088	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why do they call you Frank?
L169087	u784	m50	FRANK	I am so sorry.
L169086	u779	m50	DONNIE	What happened to your eye?
L169084	u779	m50	DONNIE	Take it off. I want to see you.
L169083	u784	m50	FRANK	Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
L169082	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
L169081	u784	m50	FRANK	You have a request?
L169080	u779	m50	DONNIE	You have to do something for me first.
L169079	u784	m50	FRANK	I want to show you something.
L168855	u784	m50	FRANK	Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
L168854	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where did you come from?
L168853	u784	m50	FRANK	You'll know soon enough.
L168852	u779	m50	DONNIE	Who is... we?
L168851	u784	m50	FRANK	We just want to guide you in the right direction.
L168850	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why did you make me flood the school?
L168836	u784	m50	FRANK	I can do anything I want... and so can you...
L168835	u779	m50	DONNIE	How can you do that?
L169307	u779	m50	DONNIE	Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
L169306	u791	m50	RONALD	What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
L168829	u779	m50	DONNIE	A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
L168828	u791	m50	RONALD	How old is Grandma Death?
L168652	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't wanna talk about it.
L168651	u791	m50	RONALD	My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
L168650	u779	m50	DONNIE	We went to a hotel.
L168649	u791	m50	RONALD	DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
L169280	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah...
L169279	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Is that a cellar door?
L169275	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Who's Frank?
L169274	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. Frank.
L169273	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Why? Is this about the book?
L169272	u779	m50	DONNIE	Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
L169270	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Where are we going?
L169269	u779	m50	DONNIE	Come with me.
L169265	u779	m50	DONNIE	There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
L169264	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What?
L169260	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's safe here.
L169259	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
L169258	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
L169257	u779	m50	DONNIE	Did you call the cops?
L169256	u779	m50	DONNIE	But you're OK?
L169255	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
L169254	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where is she?
L169253	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	My mom is gone.
L169252	u779	m50	DONNIE	Hey. You OK?
L169251	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Hey.
L169170	u779	m50	DONNIE	Then when? I have to talk to you.
L169169	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
L169168	u779	m50	DONNIE	Will you please talk to me?
L169142	u779	m50	DONNIE	What do you mean?
L169141	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What's wrong with you?
L169140	u779	m50	DONNIE	You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
L169099	u779	m50	DONNIE	The whole movie. Let's go.
L169098	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What? How long was I asleep?
L169067	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
L169066	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
L169065	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Infant Memory Generators.
L169064	u779	m50	DONNIE	So, we call them... IMGs.
L169044	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Maybe she's asleep.
L169043	u779	m50	DONNIE	I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
L169042	u779	m50	DONNIE	She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
L169041	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	"Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?"
L169040	u779	m50	DONNIE	The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
L169039	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Who?
L169038	u779	m50	DONNIE	I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
L169037	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Are you okay?
L169036	u779	m50	DONNIE	They suspended me for two days.
L169016	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What?
L169015	u779	m50	DONNIE	We're moving through time.
L168973	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
L168972	u779	m50	DONNIE	I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
L168971	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
L168970	u779	m50	DONNIE	That's alright... I understand.
L168969	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	You want to kiss me...
L168968	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well...
L168967	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	And what?
L168966	u779	m50	DONNIE	You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
L168965	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
L168964	u779	m50	DONNIE	With, like, images?
L168963	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
L168962	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why not just buy your baby a night light?
L168961	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
L168958	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
L168957	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What happened to your neck?
L168874	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
L168873	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why?
L168872	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
L168871	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah?
L168870	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Donnie?
L168869	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	And you'd never been there before?
L168868	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
L168867	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
L168866	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
L168865	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
L168864	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
L168863	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
L168783	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I'm going home.
L168782	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where are you going?
L168781	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Sure.
L168780	u779	m50	DONNIE	No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
L168779	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Where are we going?
L168778	u779	m50	DONNIE	Will you go with me?
L168777	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	That was a compliment.
L168776	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm sorry.
L168775	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	You're weird.
L168774	u779	m50	DONNIE	We never would have had this conversation.
L168773	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Why is that?
L168772	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
L168771	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Until it withers away.
L168770	u779	m50	DONNIE	The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
L168769	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Wonder where we'll be then.
L168768	u779	m50	DONNIE	Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
L168767	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	You mean soap?
L168766	u779	m50	DONNIE	I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
L168765	u779	m50	DONNIE	That's easy. Antiseptics.
L168764	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
L168763	u779	m50	DONNIE	What makes you think I'm not?
L168762	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
L168761	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
L168760	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
L168759	u779	m50	DONNIE	Wow. Did he go to jail?
L168758	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
L168757	u779	m50	DONNIE	Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
L168756	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
L168755	u779	m50	DONNIE	So... you just moved here?
L168754	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Fuck them.
L168753	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
L168752	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Don't look so freaked.
L168751	u779	m50	DONNIE	Sure.
L168750	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Wanna walk me home?
L168749	u779	m50	DONNIE	School's cancelled.
L168748	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Hey...
L168747	u779	m50	DONNIE	Hey...
L168895	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
L168894	u779	m50	DONNIE	People aren't that simple.
L168893	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
L168892	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
L168891	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
L168890	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	The Lifeline is divided that way.
L168889	u779	m50	DONNIE	I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
L168888	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
L168887	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
L169159	u792	m50	ROSE	It feels wonderful.
L169158	u779	m50	DONNIE	How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
L169157	u792	m50	ROSE	If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
L169156	u779	m50	DONNIE	Do you get to meet Ed?
L169155	u792	m50	ROSE	I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
L169063	u779	m50	DONNIE	Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
L169062	u792	m50	ROSE	He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
L168922	u792	m50	ROSE	That is a terrible nickname.
L168921	u779	m50	DONNIE	Grandma Death.
L168599	u779	m50	DONNIE	Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
L168598	u792	m50	ROSE	You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
L168597	u779	m50	DONNIE	I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
L168596	u792	m50	ROSE	I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
L168588	u792	m50	ROSE	We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
L168587	u779	m50	DONNIE	Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
L168583	u792	m50	ROSE	When did you stop taking your medication?
L168582	u779	m50	DONNIE	You're such a fuck-ass.
L168571	u792	m50	ROSE	No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
L168570	u779	m50	DONNIE	Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
L169105	u782	m50	EDDIE	I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
L169104	u779	m50	DONNIE	I know, Dad.
L169103	u782	m50	EDDIE	You're my only son...
L169102	u779	m50	DONNIE	A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
L169101	u782	m50	EDDIE	Who's been giving you weird looks?
L168927	u779	m50	DONNIE	I guess she just lost faith in the world.
L168926	u782	m50	EDDIE	You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
L168924	u779	m50	DONNIE	You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
L168923	u782	m50	EDDIE	Grandma Death.
L168685	u779	m50	DONNIE	Grandma Death.
L168684	u782	m50	EDDIE	Oh, shit!
L168683	u782	m50	EDDIE	You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
L168682	u779	m50	DONNIE	So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
L168681	u782	m50	EDDIE	No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
L168680	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where it came from?
L168679	u782	m50	EDDIE	Know what?
L168678	u779	m50	DONNIE	Do they know yet?
L168677	u782	m50	EDDIE	Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
L168676	u779	m50	DONNIE	It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
L168675	u782	m50	EDDIE	So how was school today?
L169185	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
L169184	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
L169183	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
L169182	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
L169181	u779	m50	DONNIE	Cellar door.
L169180	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	"A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that ""Cellar Door"" is the most beautiful."
L169179	u779	m50	DONNIE	"What's ""Cellar Door""?"
L169178	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
L169177	u779	m50	DONNIE	What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
L169176	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
L169175	u779	m50	DONNIE	That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
L169174	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
L169173	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where are you going?
L169172	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
L169171	u779	m50	DONNIE	Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
L169136	u779	m50	DONNIE	Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
L169135	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
L169134	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
L169133	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
L169132	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why should we care?
L169131	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
L168877	u779	m50	DONNIE	A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
L168876	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Who is Frank?
L168668	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
L168667	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
L169241	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Goodbye, Donald.
L169240	u779	m50	DONNIE	Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
L169239	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
L169238	u779	m50	DONNIE	Thank you.
L169237	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
L169235	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
L169234	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
L169233	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
L169232	u779	m50	DONNIE	He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
L169231	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Where is he, Donald?
L169230	u779	m50	DONNIE	I can see him right now!
L169228	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Who is he going to kill?
L169227	u779	m50	DONNIE	Frank is going to kill.
L169226	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What is going to happen?
L169224	u779	m50	DONNIE	Soon. Time is almost up.
L169223	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	When will this happen?
L169222	u779	m50	DONNIE	It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
L169221	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Then how is time travel possible?
L169220	u779	m50	DONNIE	Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
L169219	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How is that possible?
L169218	u779	m50	DONNIE	I have the power to build a time machine.
L169217	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Where are we going, Donald?
L169216	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Where are we going?
L169215	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
L169214	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	God exists because you're horny.
L169213	u779	m50	DONNIE	Because I'm so horny.
L169212	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Why?
L169211	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think now that he might...
L169210	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	If God exists?
L169209	u779	m50	DONNIE	I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
L169208	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
L169207	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
L169206	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	You've done it again?
L169205	u779	m50	DONNIE	That I did it again.
L169204	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What else makes you feel regret?
L169203	u779	m50	DONNIE	Regret.
L169202	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
L169201	u779	m50	DONNIE	Hungry Hungry Hippos.
L169200	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What did you want for Christmas that year?
L169199	u779	m50	DONNIE	They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
L169198	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
L169197	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes. I went to jail.
L169196	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	But you were punished.
L169195	u779	m50	DONNIE	People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
L169194	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
L169193	u779	m50	DONNIE	People get hurt.
L169192	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
L169191	u779	m50	DONNIE	I... I was playing with fire.
L169190	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
L169189	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes.
L169188	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
L169060	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Have you ever made love, Donald?
L169059	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
L169058	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	The good stuff.
L169057	u779	m50	DONNIE	I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
L169056	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I know.
L169055	u779	m50	DONNIE	Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
L169053	u779	m50	DONNIE	You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
L169052	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
L169051	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
L169050	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
L169049	u779	m50	DONNIE	Nothing.
L169048	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What did you find?
L169047	u779	m50	DONNIE	It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
L169046	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	And they grow out of our stomachs?
L168942	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	No. That makes you keep searching.
L168941	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
L168940	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you feel alone right now?
L168939	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
L168938	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Is Callie still around?
L168937	u779	m50	DONNIE	It reminded me of my dog Callie.
L168936	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How does that make you feel?
L168935	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
L168934	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	A sign from whom?
L168933	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
L168932	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
L168931	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
L168930	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Can anyone else see him?
L168929	u779	m50	DONNIE	Four times... so far.
L168928	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How many times have you seen Frank?
L168802	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
L168801	u779	m50	DONNIE	No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
L168800	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What about your family, Donnie?
L168799	u779	m50	DONNIE	I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
L168798	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Who is the boss?
L168797	u779	m50	DONNIE	"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""
L168796	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What else do you think about during school?
L168795	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think about... fucking a lot during school.
L168794	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I asked you about school.
L168793	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think about girls a lot.
L168792	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How are things going at school?
L168791	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes.
L168790	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you think a lot about girls?
L168789	u779	m50	DONNIE	Gretchen. We're going together now.
L168788	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What is her name?
L168787	u779	m50	DONNIE	I met a girl.
L168786	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	So, tell me about your day, Donald.
L168785	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes.
L168784	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
L168706	u779	m50	DONNIE	No.  That's stupid.
L168705	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
L168704	u779	m50	DONNIE	Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
L168703	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Follow him where?
L168702	u779	m50	DONNIE	He said to follow him.
L168701	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
L168699	u779	m50	DONNIE	A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
L168698	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I don't own a television.
L168697	u779	m50	DONNIE	Don't you watch the news?
L168696	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How so?
L168695	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think he saved my life.
L168694	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Frank.
L168693	u779	m50	DONNIE	His name is Frank.
L168692	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Would you like to talk about this friend?
L168691	u779	m50	DONNIE	So, I met a new friend.
L168690	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
L168689	u779	m50	DONNIE	I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
L168688	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
L169246	u779	m50	DONNIE	Everything is going to be just fine.
L169245	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Okay, but it has to be a small one.
L169244	u779	m50	DONNIE	Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
L169243	u779	m50	DONNIE	Congratulations.
L169242	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
L168987	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
L168986	u779	m50	DONNIE	Her name is Gretchen.
L168985	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
L168984	u779	m50	DONNIE	I was just being honest.
L168983	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
L168982	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
L168981	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	No I don't.  She worries about you.
L168980	u779	m50	DONNIE	Because you tell Mom everything.
L168979	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Why would I tell Mom?
L168978	u779	m50	DONNIE	You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
L168977	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	What's her name?
L168976	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah.
L168975	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	So I hear you have a girlfriend.
L168920	u779	m50	DONNIE	Guess who wrote it?
L168919	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
L168918	u779	m50	DONNIE	"It's called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel""."
L168579	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
L168578	u779	m50	DONNIE	Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
L169035	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
L169034	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
L169032	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
L169031	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
L169030	u779	m50	DONNIE	Gerald.
L169029	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Excuse me? What's your name, son?
L169028	u779	m50	DONNIE	How much are they paying you to be here?
L169003	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
L169002	u792	m50	ROSE	If that's what you think is necessary.
L169001	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
L169000	u792	m50	ROSE	I... What can we do?
L168999	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
L168998	u792	m50	ROSE	You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
L168997	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
L168996	u792	m50	ROSE	Frank?
L168995	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
L168994	u792	m50	ROSE	Come again?
L168993	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Has your son ever told you about Frank?
L168990	u792	m50	ROSE	Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
L168989	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What I think is going on with your son.
L168988	u792	m50	ROSE	Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
L168642	u782	m50	EDDIE	He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
L168641	u792	m50	ROSE	He was a year ahead of us?
L168640	u782	m50	EDDIE	Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
L168639	u792	m50	ROSE	What?
L168633	u782	m50	EDDIE	You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
L168632	u792	m50	ROSE	So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
L168602	u782	m50	EDDIE	You're not a bitch.
L168601	u792	m50	ROSE	Our son just called me a bitch.
L169163	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
L169162	u792	m50	ROSE	Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
L168594	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
L168593	u792	m50	ROSE	It is a big deal.
L168592	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
L168591	u792	m50	ROSE	How did you know --
L168590	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
L168586	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	You can suck a fuck.
L168585	u792	m50	ROSE	That's enough.
L168584	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
L168577	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Donnie? You're a dick.
L168576	u792	m50	ROSE	Excuse me?
L168573	u792	m50	ROSE	If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
L168572	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
L168734	u787	m50	LEROY	I guess they made him do it.
L168733	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	How did this happen?
L168732	u787	m50	LEROY	Yep.
L168731	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	Christ. Is that an axe?
L168730	u787	m50	LEROY	What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
L168729	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	What else?
L168728	u787	m50	LEROY	I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
L169153	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
L169152	u792	m50	ROSE	Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
L169151	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
L169150	u792	m50	ROSE	But now you can't go.
L169149	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
L169148	u792	m50	ROSE	Beg pardon?
L169147	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
L169146	u792	m50	ROSE	Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
L169145	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
L169144	u792	m50	ROSE	Kitty...
L169143	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose.
L168899	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
L168898	u792	m50	ROSE	Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
L168862	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	"I think we've all seen ""Bonanza""."
L168861	u792	m50	ROSE	Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
L168858	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
L168857	u792	m50	ROSE	Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
L168848	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
L168847	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
L168846	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
L168844	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
L168843	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	Kitty...
L168842	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
L168841	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
L169248	u791	m50	RONALD	I stole four beers from my dad.
L169247	u794	m50	SEAN	We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
L168821	u791	m50	RONALD	Not Vanity. He's a homo.
L168820	u794	m50	SEAN	Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
L168819	u791	m50	RONALD	Smurfette doesn't fuck.
L168818	u794	m50	SEAN	No more fuckin' for her.
L168817	u791	m50	RONALD	Wicked.
L168815	u794	m50	SEAN	Raspberry.
L168814	u791	m50	RONALD	What is this shit?
L168720	u791	m50	RONALD	Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
L168719	u794	m50	SEAN	All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
L168717	u794	m50	SEAN	Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
L168716	u791	m50	RONALD	There's no rule!
L168715	u794	m50	SEAN	You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
L168714	u791	m50	RONALD	Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
L168660	u794	m50	SEAN	Go back to China, bitch!
L168659	u791	m50	RONALD	Chut up!
L195847	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I think I found something...
L195846	u879	m57	COOPER	Justin?
L195845	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Holy shit...
L195842	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
L195841	u879	m57	COOPER	Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
L195840	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
L195839	u879	m57	COOPER	...do you copy?
L195767	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
L195766	u879	m57	COOPER	You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
L195674	u882	m57	JUSTIN	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
L195673	u879	m57	COOPER	I can see why they sent you along.
L195651	u879	m57	COOPER	I heard it.
L195650	u882	m57	JUSTIN	That means top-secret, Cooper.
L195645	u879	m57	COOPER	I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
L195644	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Ballast.
L196373	u884	m57	MILLER	It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
L196372	u879	m57	COOPER	Will it work?
L196371	u884	m57	MILLER	You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
L196370	u879	m57	COOPER	...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
L196239	u884	m57	MILLER	On my way.
L196238	u879	m57	COOPER	Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
L196127	u884	m57	MILLER	I'll get him.
L196126	u879	m57	COOPER	But Justin...
L195894	u884	m57	MILLER	Hold on, Coop...
L195893	u879	m57	COOPER	The containment, Second Containment...
L195892	u884	m57	MILLER	Coop, where are you...
L195891	u879	m57	COOPER	We have a man down...
L195764	u879	m57	COOPER	I'll be all over it.
L195763	u884	m57	MILLER	You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
L195762	u879	m57	COOPER	...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
L195693	u884	m57	MILLER	You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
L195692	u879	m57	COOPER	From what?
L195658	u884	m57	MILLER	EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
L195657	u879	m57	COOPER	...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
L195643	u884	m57	MILLER	This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
L195642	u879	m57	COOPER	You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
L195641	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
L195588	u884	m57	MILLER	Don't start with me, Cooper.
L195587	u879	m57	COOPER	Time to play Spam in the can.
L196302	u886	m57	SMITH	Roger that.
L196301	u879	m57	COOPER	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
L196300	u879	m57	COOPER	Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
L196243	u879	m57	COOPER	We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
L196242	u886	m57	SMITH	It's holding... She's holding...!
L196119	u886	m57	SMITH	What about the accumulator...?
L196118	u879	m57	COOPER	We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
L195991	u879	m57	COOPER	You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
L195990	u886	m57	SMITH	You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
L195989	u879	m57	COOPER	Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
L195988	u886	m57	SMITH	You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
L195987	u879	m57	COOPER	What?
L195986	u886	m57	SMITH	I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
L195985	u879	m57	COOPER	You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
L195964	u879	m57	COOPER	"I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking ""optical effect!"""
L195963	u888	m57	WEIR	What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
L195962	u879	m57	COOPER	I'm telling you, I saw it...
L195961	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know what happened to Justin.
L195958	u888	m57	WEIR	Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
L195957	u879	m57	COOPER	You weren't there. I saw it.
L195956	u888	m57	WEIR	No, he didn't.
L195955	u879	m57	COOPER	It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
L195695	u879	m57	COOPER	Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
L195694	u888	m57	WEIR	The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
L195630	u888	m57	WEIR	No, thank you.
L195629	u879	m57	COOPER	Coffee.
L195628	u888	m57	WEIR	What?
L195627	u879	m57	COOPER	Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
L196384	u887	m57	STARCK	Run!
L196383	u879	m57	COOPER	What...?
L196379	u887	m57	STARCK	Hurry.
L196378	u879	m57	COOPER	I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
L196366	u879	m57	COOPER	I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
L196365	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
L196364	u879	m57	COOPER	Can you shut it down?
L196363	u887	m57	STARCK	There must be a way! What about Engineering?
L196362	u879	m57	COOPER	How? The Bridge is gone.
L196358	u887	m57	STARCK	You're okay now, it's over...
L196357	u879	m57	COOPER	Let me breathe, let me breathe...
L195867	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know, the screens are dead...!
L195866	u879	m57	COOPER	What's happening?
L195597	u887	m57	STARCK	It is not.
L195596	u879	m57	COOPER	Is that an offer?
L196337	u884	m57	MILLER	Oh God...
L196336	u880	m57	DJ	Please... kill...
L196335	u884	m57	MILLER	Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
L196334	u880	m57	DJ	Please...
L196323	u884	m57	MILLER	Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
L196322	u880	m57	DJ	What happened?
L196321	u884	m57	MILLER	DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
L196237	u880	m57	DJ	No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
L196236	u884	m57	MILLER	Save yourself. From Hell.  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
L196235	u880	m57	DJ	"It sounds like ""ex infera:"" ""ex,"" from; ""infera,"" the ablative case of ""inferi."" ""Hell."""
L196234	u884	m57	MILLER	Hear what?
L196233	u880	m57	DJ	Do you hear it? Right there.
L196231	u880	m57	DJ	It gets worse.
L196230	u884	m57	MILLER	It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
L196229	u880	m57	DJ	"They thought it said, ""Liberatis me,"" ""Save me,"" but it's not ""me."" It's ""tutemet:"" ""Save yourself."""
L196228	u884	m57	MILLER	Go on.
L196227	u880	m57	DJ	I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
L196226	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it?
L196225	u880	m57	DJ	No.
L196224	u884	m57	MILLER	I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
L196222	u880	m57	DJ	Another man? Who?
L196221	u884	m57	MILLER	Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
L196190	u884	m57	MILLER	We'll make it.
L196189	u880	m57	DJ	He'll live... if we ever make it back.
L196076	u884	m57	MILLER	I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
L196075	u880	m57	DJ	To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
L196048	u884	m57	MILLER	Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
L196047	u880	m57	DJ	Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
L195941	u880	m57	DJ	His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
L195940	u884	m57	MILLER	How is he?
L195919	u884	m57	MILLER	No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
L195918	u880	m57	DJ	We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
L195648	u884	m57	MILLER	And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
L195647	u880	m57	DJ	Trauma.
L195646	u884	m57	MILLER	He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
L196188	u880	m57	DJ	One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
L196187	u885	m57	PETERS	His peritoneum has ruptured...
L196186	u880	m57	DJ	Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
L196184	u880	m57	DJ	He's crashing...
L196183	u885	m57	PETERS	90 over 50 and falling... .
L196182	u880	m57	DJ	Pressure?
L196181	u885	m57	PETERS	I've got a pulse, he's alive...
L196100	u885	m57	PETERS	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
L196099	u880	m57	DJ	What's wrong?
L196023	u880	m57	DJ	A power drain --
L196022	u885	m57	PETERS	What's happening...?
L195984	u885	m57	PETERS	Nothing. It's nothing.
L195983	u880	m57	DJ	What's wrong?
L195564	u881	m57	HOLLIS	Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
L195563	u888	m57	WEIR	Thank you.
L195562	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
L195551	u888	m57	WEIR	A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
L195550	u881	m57	HOLLIS	That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
L195549	u888	m57	WEIR	It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
L195548	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
L195547	u888	m57	WEIR	Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
L195545	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
L195544	u888	m57	WEIR	You wanted to see me, Admiral?
L195575	u883	m57	LYLE	The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
L195574	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
L195573	u883	m57	LYLE	Some things you don't get over.
L195572	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
L195571	u883	m57	LYLE	He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
L195570	u881	m57	HOLLIS	What's on your mind?
L195569	u883	m57	LYLE	Does he know that?
L195568	u881	m57	HOLLIS	That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
L195567	u883	m57	LYLE	The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
L195566	u881	m57	HOLLIS	You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
L195565	u883	m57	LYLE	You're not seriously considering sending him?
L195557	u883	m57	LYLE	Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
L195556	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
L196160	u885	m57	PETERS	Starck!
L196159	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Oh my god OH MY GOD...
L196148	u882	m57	JUSTIN	From the Other Place...
L196147	u885	m57	PETERS	The dark inside...? I don't understand.
L196146	u882	m57	JUSTIN	...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
L196145	u882	m57	JUSTIN	The dark inside me.
L196144	u885	m57	PETERS	What does?
L196143	u882	m57	JUSTIN	It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
L196142	u885	m57	PETERS	What, Justin, what shows you?
L195827	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'm going in.
L195826	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
L195825	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
L195802	u888	m57	WEIR	Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
L195801	u882	m57	JUSTIN	We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
L195800	u888	m57	WEIR	You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
L195672	u888	m57	WEIR	I built it.
L195671	u882	m57	JUSTIN	How do you know all this?
L195670	u888	m57	WEIR	...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
L196174	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin. I won't let you die.
L196173	u882	m57	JUSTIN	But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
L196172	u884	m57	MILLER	You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
L196171	u882	m57	JUSTIN	...I don't want to die...!
L196167	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Skipper, you gotta help me...
L196166	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin.
L196165	u884	m57	MILLER	Patch me through to him.
L195854	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
L195853	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin, finish your sweep.
L195755	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Yes, sir!
L195754	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
L195583	u884	m57	MILLER	Start the countdown.
L195582	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
L195561	u888	m57	WEIR	Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
L195560	u883	m57	LYLE	The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
L195559	u888	m57	WEIR	The crew? Could they still be alive?
L195558	u883	m57	LYLE	Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
L195555	u888	m57	WEIR	This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
L195554	u883	m57	LYLE	I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
L195553	u888	m57	WEIR	I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
L195552	u883	m57	LYLE	Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
L195543	u883	m57	LYLE	Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
L195542	u888	m57	WEIR	This is Weir.
L196194	u884	m57	MILLER	Thanks.
L196193	u885	m57	PETERS	I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
L196192	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
L196115	u885	m57	PETERS	Justin.
L196114	u884	m57	MILLER	That's a negative, Starck.
L196021	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it.
L196020	u885	m57	PETERS	I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
L195947	u884	m57	MILLER	Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
L195946	u885	m57	PETERS	I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
L195945	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
L195890	u885	m57	PETERS	Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
L195889	u884	m57	MILLER	...you okay?
L195888	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters...
L195887	u885	m57	PETERS	Skipper...
L195886	u884	m57	MILLER	Can anybody hear me...
L195852	u885	m57	PETERS	Crystallized.
L195851	u884	m57	MILLER	...how's the client?
L195850	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
L195831	u885	m57	PETERS	Frozen.
L195830	u884	m57	MILLER	Alive?
L195829	u885	m57	PETERS	I found one.
L195819	u884	m57	MILLER	The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
L195818	u885	m57	PETERS	Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
L195817	u884	m57	MILLER	What you got, Peters?
L195816	u885	m57	PETERS	Okay. I'm on the bridge.
L195812	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one here, Skipper.
L195811	u884	m57	MILLER	The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
L195792	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, you still showing those readings?
L195791	u885	m57	PETERS	I can see the hatch.
L195788	u885	m57	PETERS	I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
L195787	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters is right, no one's here.
L195783	u884	m57	MILLER	So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
L195782	u885	m57	PETERS	That means they didn't abandon ship.
L195773	u884	m57	MILLER	Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
L195772	u885	m57	PETERS	Jesus its huge.
L195771	u884	m57	MILLER	Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
L195770	u885	m57	PETERS	We've got pressure.
L195595	u884	m57	MILLER	I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
L195594	u885	m57	PETERS	No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
L195593	u884	m57	MILLER	I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
L195592	u885	m57	PETERS	Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
L195591	u884	m57	MILLER	What's the hold up?
L196428	u888	m57	WEIR	NOOO!
L196427	u884	m57	MILLER	You can't have them. Go to hell.
L196425	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck... Cooper...
L196424	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
L196423	u884	m57	MILLER	You're lying...!
L196422	u888	m57	WEIR	There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
L196417	u888	m57	WEIR	Better if I just show you.
L196416	u884	m57	MILLER	Then what, what are you? Tell me...
L196415	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm not the Devil.
L196414	u884	m57	MILLER	You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
L196413	u888	m57	WEIR	You know.
L196412	u884	m57	MILLER	What are you?
L196401	u888	m57	WEIR	Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
L196400	u884	m57	MILLER	Then who the fuck are you?
L196399	u888	m57	WEIR	Weir is dead.
L196348	u888	m57	WEIR	What makes you think I'll miss?
L196347	u884	m57	MILLER	If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
L196343	u888	m57	WEIR	Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
L196342	u884	m57	MILLER	What are you talking about?
L196341	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
L196340	u884	m57	MILLER	Your eyes...
L196332	u884	m57	MILLER	Son of a bitch!
L196331	u888	m57	WEIR	I told you... She won't let you leave...
L196272	u884	m57	MILLER	Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
L196271	u888	m57	WEIR	You can't leave. She won't let you.
L196265	u884	m57	MILLER	Watch me.
L196264	u888	m57	WEIR	You... You can't do that!
L196263	u884	m57	MILLER	We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
L196262	u888	m57	WEIR	What about my ship?
L196258	u884	m57	MILLER	It's done.
L196257	u888	m57	WEIR	Don't... don't do this...
L196256	u884	m57	MILLER	Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
L196255	u888	m57	WEIR	You're insane. You've lost your mind.
L196254	u884	m57	MILLER	...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship. The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
L196253	u888	m57	WEIR	You can't, your orders are specific...
L196252	u884	m57	MILLER	We're leaving.
L196217	u884	m57	MILLER	That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
L196216	u888	m57	WEIR	I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
L196215	u884	m57	MILLER	"The ""Other Place,"" what is that...?"
L196214	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know...
L196213	u884	m57	MILLER	Where has it been for the past seven years?
L196212	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know...
L196211	u884	m57	MILLER	To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
L196210	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes...
L196209	u884	m57	MILLER	You said this ship creates a gateway...
L196208	u888	m57	WEIR	What do you want me to say?
L196207	u884	m57	MILLER	That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
L196206	u888	m57	WEIR	Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
L196205	u884	m57	MILLER	I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
L196198	u888	m57	WEIR	Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
L196197	u884	m57	MILLER	"Is that your ""expert opinion?"" The only answer we've had out of you is ""I don't know."""
L196074	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it.
L196073	u888	m57	WEIR	I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
L196072	u884	m57	MILLER	We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
L196031	u888	m57	WEIR	Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
L196030	u884	m57	MILLER	We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
L196025	u888	m57	WEIR	The Core...!
L196024	u884	m57	MILLER	We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
L196019	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know.
L196018	u884	m57	MILLER	What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
L196009	u888	m57	WEIR	Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
L196008	u884	m57	MILLER	Explanation?
L196005	u888	m57	WEIR	Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
L196004	u884	m57	MILLER	It's 2041...
L196003	u888	m57	WEIR	The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
L196002	u884	m57	MILLER	What about it?
L196001	u888	m57	WEIR	The date.
L196000	u884	m57	MILLER	You have something, Dr. Weir?
L195979	u884	m57	MILLER	Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
L195978	u888	m57	WEIR	There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
L195977	u884	m57	MILLER	I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
L195976	u888	m57	WEIR	If it worked, yes.
L195975	u884	m57	MILLER	If it worked.
L195974	u888	m57	WEIR	Insane? The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
L195973	u884	m57	MILLER	It's insane.
L195969	u884	m57	MILLER	How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
L195968	u888	m57	WEIR	It's complicated...
L195967	u884	m57	MILLER	What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
L195966	u888	m57	WEIR	It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
L195965	u884	m57	MILLER	"Hold on, what's this ""gravitational distortion?"""
L195953	u884	m57	MILLER	One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
L195952	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195910	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
L195909	u888	m57	WEIR	It beats dying, Mister Smith.
L195799	u884	m57	MILLER	They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
L195798	u888	m57	WEIR	No one?
L195797	u884	m57	MILLER	Negative.
L195796	u888	m57	WEIR	Any survivors?
L195790	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
L195789	u884	m57	MILLER	Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
L195781	u888	m57	WEIR	In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
L195780	u884	m57	MILLER	I can see that, what're they for?
L195775	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
L195774	u888	m57	WEIR	You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
L195760	u884	m57	MILLER	-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
L195759	u888	m57	WEIR	That is not acceptable --
L195758	u884	m57	MILLER	Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
L195757	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
L195756	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
L195742	u888	m57	WEIR	Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
L195741	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
L195740	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
L195689	u888	m57	WEIR	NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
L195688	u884	m57	MILLER	What does it say?
L195677	u888	m57	WEIR	That's what we're here to find out.
L195676	u884	m57	MILLER	Where has it been for the last seven years?
L195675	u888	m57	WEIR	It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
L195601	u884	m57	MILLER	Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
L195600	u888	m57	WEIR	I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
L195599	u884	m57	MILLER	Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
L195598	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
L195590	u884	m57	MILLER	The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
L195589	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, I just want to say...
L196315	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
L196314	u886	m57	SMITH	Where is it, where is it...
L196313	u884	m57	MILLER	Get out of there now!
L196312	u886	m57	SMITH	No, no, we just got her back together...
L196311	u884	m57	MILLER	Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
L196310	u884	m57	MILLER	One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
L196309	u886	m57	SMITH	Come again, Skipper?
L196308	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, get out of there...
L196307	u886	m57	SMITH	I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
L196306	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it, Smith?
L196305	u886	m57	SMITH	Skipper...
L196286	u884	m57	MILLER	Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
L196285	u886	m57	SMITH	She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
L196284	u884	m57	MILLER	Now what?
L196283	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain, we got a problem.
L196282	u884	m57	MILLER	Thank you.
L196071	u884	m57	MILLER	Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
L196070	u886	m57	SMITH	Sir.
L196064	u884	m57	MILLER	That's enough!
L196063	u886	m57	SMITH	...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
L195939	u886	m57	SMITH	Understood.
L195938	u884	m57	MILLER	We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
L195937	u886	m57	SMITH	I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
L195936	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
L195935	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain Miller, you copy?
L195912	u884	m57	MILLER	You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
L195911	u886	m57	SMITH	But...
L195903	u886	m57	SMITH	They're gone.
L195902	u884	m57	MILLER	No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
L195901	u886	m57	SMITH	We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
L195900	u886	m57	SMITH	We don't have time to fart.
L195899	u884	m57	MILLER	Do we have enough time for a weld?
L195897	u886	m57	SMITH	We have a situation here...
L195896	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
L195895	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain Miller...
L195744	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, give me a read.
L195743	u886	m57	SMITH	It is now.  We're locked in.
L195735	u886	m57	SMITH	Love to.
L195734	u884	m57	MILLER	Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
L195726	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck...
L195725	u886	m57	SMITH	Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
L195722	u884	m57	MILLER	Where is it?
L195721	u886	m57	SMITH	1500 meters. We're getting too close...
L195717	u884	m57	MILLER	I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
L195716	u886	m57	SMITH	We've got some weather.
L195712	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir...!
L195711	u886	m57	SMITH	Yes, sir.
L195710	u884	m57	MILLER	I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
L195709	u886	m57	SMITH	Something like that, yeah.
L195708	u884	m57	MILLER	"What are you trying to say? ""If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"""
L195707	u886	m57	SMITH	That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
L195706	u884	m57	MILLER	We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
L195703	u884	m57	MILLER	Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
L195702	u886	m57	SMITH	We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
L195701	u886	m57	SMITH	One-four degrees...
L195700	u884	m57	MILLER	...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
L195699	u886	m57	SMITH	Heading three-three-four...
L195683	u884	m57	MILLER	What is that?
L195682	u886	m57	SMITH	Jesus...
L195579	u886	m57	SMITH	Locked and cocked.
L195578	u884	m57	MILLER	I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
L196395	u884	m57	MILLER	He's dead...
L196394	u887	m57	STARCK	Weir.
L196388	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
L196387	u884	m57	MILLER	...repeat, we're armed...
L196386	u884	m57	MILLER	We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
L196375	u884	m57	MILLER	No. I'll be right back.
L196374	u887	m57	STARCK	I'll do it --
L196369	u884	m57	MILLER	We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
L196368	u887	m57	STARCK	Blow it up?
L196367	u884	m57	MILLER	BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
L196361	u887	m57	STARCK	We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
L196360	u884	m57	MILLER	Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
L196354	u884	m57	MILLER	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
L196353	u887	m57	STARCK	Weir can't be alive.
L196177	u887	m57	STARCK	Five seconds.
L196176	u884	m57	MILLER	Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
L196134	u887	m57	STARCK	You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
L196133	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm on my way, Starck.
L196125	u884	m57	MILLER	Stay here! Don't stop working!
L196124	u887	m57	STARCK	He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
L196123	u884	m57	MILLER	What?
L196122	u887	m57	STARCK	Justin's in the airlock.
L196121	u884	m57	MILLER	What's going on in there, Starck?
L196120	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, come in...
L196096	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
L196095	u887	m57	STARCK	Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
L196094	u884	m57	MILLER	What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
L196093	u887	m57	STARCK	I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
L196092	u884	m57	MILLER	If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
L196091	u887	m57	STARCK	I know that.
L196090	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
L196089	u887	m57	STARCK	It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
L196088	u884	m57	MILLER	We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
L196087	u887	m57	STARCK	I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
L196086	u884	m57	MILLER	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
L196085	u887	m57	STARCK	You've got to listen...
L196083	u887	m57	STARCK	There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
L196082	u884	m57	MILLER	Go ahead.
L196081	u887	m57	STARCK	I've got a theory.
L196080	u884	m57	MILLER	...bio-readings of indeterminate origin, don't you have anything useful to tell me?
L196079	u887	m57	STARCK	...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
L196078	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it, Starck?
L196077	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller...
L196052	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
L196051	u887	m57	STARCK	Who?
L196050	u884	m57	MILLER	No. It was someone else.
L196049	u887	m57	STARCK	Maybe one of the original crew?
L195951	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it. Dr. Weir...
L195950	u887	m57	STARCK	I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
L195949	u884	m57	MILLER	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
L195948	u887	m57	STARCK	What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
L195933	u884	m57	MILLER	So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
L195932	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
L195931	u884	m57	MILLER	What's causing the readings?
L195930	u887	m57	STARCK	"The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: ""Bio-readings of indeterminate origin."" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels."
L195929	u884	m57	MILLER	What about the life readings you picked up?
L195928	u887	m57	STARCK	I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
L195927	u884	m57	MILLER	We can take the filters from the Clark...
L195926	u887	m57	STARCK	It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
L195925	u884	m57	MILLER	Carbon dioxide?
L195924	u887	m57	STARCK	Oxygen is not the problem.
L195923	u884	m57	MILLER	How much oh-two do we have?
L195922	u887	m57	STARCK	The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
L195921	u884	m57	MILLER	But you can breathe it.
L195920	u887	m57	STARCK	It tastes bad.
L195917	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
L195916	u887	m57	STARCK	We're all here.
L195915	u884	m57	MILLER	Everybody okay?
L195794	u884	m57	MILLER	Keep your eyes open.
L195793	u887	m57	STARCK	That's an affirmative.
L195751	u887	m57	STARCK	There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
L195750	u884	m57	MILLER	Radiation interference?
L195749	u887	m57	STARCK	Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
L195698	u884	m57	MILLER	Come around to three-three-four...
L195697	u887	m57	STARCK	Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
L195635	u884	m57	MILLER	Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
L195634	u887	m57	STARCK	I just finished drying...
L195633	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
L195585	u884	m57	MILLER	Let's go.
L195584	u887	m57	STARCK	Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
L195581	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin?
L195580	u887	m57	STARCK	We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
L196057	u885	m57	PETERS	I've seen bodies before. This is different.
L196056	u888	m57	WEIR	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
L196055	u885	m57	PETERS	About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
L196054	u885	m57	PETERS	I did.
L196053	u888	m57	WEIR	No. I saw nothing.
L195810	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one here.
L195809	u888	m57	WEIR	Can you see a body?
L195808	u885	m57	PETERS	Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
L195807	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
L195804	u888	m57	WEIR	You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
L195803	u885	m57	PETERS	Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
L195779	u888	m57	WEIR	They're explosive charges.
L195778	u885	m57	PETERS	Here's another one. They're all over the place.
L195624	u885	m57	PETERS	DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
L195623	u888	m57	WEIR	Claire...
L195608	u885	m57	PETERS	They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
L195607	u888	m57	WEIR	Wasn't that ship destroyed?
L195606	u885	m57	PETERS	He served on the Goliath.
L195605	u888	m57	WEIR	He's been past Mars?
L195604	u885	m57	PETERS	Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
L195603	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195602	u885	m57	PETERS	First time in a grav couch?
L196248	u885	m57	PETERS	I don't care.
L196247	u887	m57	STARCK	It's cold.
L196246	u885	m57	PETERS	You got any coffee?
L196164	u887	m57	STARCK	Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
L196163	u885	m57	PETERS	We have to do something, oh God...
L196154	u885	m57	PETERS	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
L196153	u887	m57	STARCK	Almost got it.
L196139	u885	m57	PETERS	Do you know what it was?
L196138	u887	m57	STARCK	Keep him talking.
L196137	u885	m57	PETERS	Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
L196129	u885	m57	PETERS	Can you shut it down?
L196128	u887	m57	STARCK	He's engaged the override.
L195786	u887	m57	STARCK	Not according to the computer.
L195785	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one in the corridor but us.
L196061	u886	m57	SMITH	Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
L196060	u888	m57	WEIR	Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
L196059	u886	m57	SMITH	I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
L195906	u888	m57	WEIR	It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
L195905	u886	m57	SMITH	What?
L195884	u888	m57	WEIR	We're losing atmosphere...
L195883	u886	m57	SMITH	The safety circuit's failed!
L195849	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
L195848	u886	m57	SMITH	What the hell is that?
L195738	u886	m57	SMITH	Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
L195737	u888	m57	WEIR	Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
L195731	u888	m57	WEIR	She's not ugly.
L195730	u886	m57	SMITH	Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
L195715	u886	m57	SMITH	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
L195714	u888	m57	WEIR	Where is she?
L195667	u888	m57	WEIR	"Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from ""point A"" here...  ...to ""point B,"" here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?"
L195666	u886	m57	SMITH	Hey...
L195908	u886	m57	SMITH	I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
L195907	u887	m57	STARCK	What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
L195865	u887	m57	STARCK	I'm trying, goddammit --
L195864	u886	m57	SMITH	Get them back --
L195863	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, do you read me, Peters --
L195834	u887	m57	STARCK	Decompression wouldn't do that.
L195833	u886	m57	SMITH	Explosive decompression.
L195832	u887	m57	STARCK	What happened to his eyes?
L195733	u887	m57	STARCK	Picking up magnetic interference.
L195732	u886	m57	SMITH	Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
L195724	u886	m57	SMITH	1000 meters...
L195723	u887	m57	STARCK	The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
L195719	u886	m57	SMITH	Range 3000 meters and closing.
L195718	u887	m57	STARCK	If they are, they're screening their calls.
L195705	u886	m57	SMITH	Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
L195704	u887	m57	STARCK	This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
L195661	u887	m57	STARCK	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
L195660	u886	m57	SMITH	You can't do that.
L195639	u887	m57	STARCK	All boards are green, everything's five by five.
L195638	u886	m57	SMITH	30 hours to Neptune orbit.
L195577	u887	m57	STARCK	Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
L195576	u886	m57	SMITH	I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
L196196	u888	m57	WEIR	It means nothing.
L196195	u887	m57	STARCK	"Justin said something about, ""The dark inside me..."" What did he mean?"
L196113	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
L196112	u888	m57	WEIR	The forward airlock.
L196111	u887	m57	STARCK	What is it?
L196110	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm alright. Please.
L196109	u887	m57	STARCK	In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
L196107	u888	m57	WEIR	It wants me. I have to go.
L196106	u887	m57	STARCK	What are you doing?
L196007	u888	m57	WEIR	No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
L196006	u887	m57	STARCK	Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
L195998	u887	m57	STARCK	I'm sorry.
L195997	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
L195996	u887	m57	STARCK	It must be hard, being so far away from her.
L195995	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195994	u887	m57	STARCK	Claire is your wife?
L195993	u888	m57	WEIR	Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
L195992	u887	m57	STARCK	Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
L195972	u887	m57	STARCK	I can't believe we built this.
L195971	u888	m57	WEIR	That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
L195859	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
L195858	u888	m57	WEIR	What is it?
L195822	u888	m57	WEIR	Ship's log.
L195821	u887	m57	STARCK	What is it?
L195753	u887	m57	STARCK	If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
L195752	u888	m57	WEIR	Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
L195747	u887	m57	STARCK	Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
L195746	u888	m57	WEIR	Do they have pressure?
L195745	u887	m57	STARCK	The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
L195669	u888	m57	WEIR	Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
L195668	u887	m57	STARCK	A straight line.
L195664	u888	m57	WEIR	Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
L195663	u887	m57	STARCK	How?
L195662	u888	m57	WEIR	"Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously ""jump"" from one point in the universe to another, light years away."

L236157	u1088	m71	GREER	After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
L236156	u1086	m71	DODGE	You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
L236131	u1088	m71	GREER	Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
L236130	u1086	m71	DODGE	The turbine blew.
L236129	u1088	m71	GREER	Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
L236128	u1086	m71	DODGE	When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
L236081	u1086	m71	DODGE	Wrong. It's Friday.
L236080	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't know. Tuesday?
L236079	u1086	m71	DODGE	What day is it?
L235992	u1086	m71	DODGE	You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
L235991	u1088	m71	GREER	I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
L235990	u1086	m71	DODGE	I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
L235983	u1088	m71	GREER	Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
L235982	u1086	m71	DODGE	Let's not be too hasty.
L235921	u1088	m71	GREER	She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
L235920	u1086	m71	DODGE	Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
L235893	u1088	m71	GREER	We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
L235892	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
L235889	u1088	m71	GREER	It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
L235888	u1086	m71	DODGE	What's so great about Sweden?
L235865	u1088	m71	GREER	Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
L235864	u1086	m71	DODGE	One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
L235805	u1088	m71	GREER	Morning, skipper.
L235804	u1086	m71	DODGE	Damn mind of it's own.
L235803	u1088	m71	GREER	Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
L235802	u1086	m71	DODGE	Fucker!
L235798	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
L235797	u1088	m71	GREER	Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
L235745	u1086	m71	DODGE	Lemme see.
L235744	u1088	m71	GREER	That's what it says.
L235743	u1086	m71	DODGE	What? You sure?
L235742	u1088	m71	GREER	Sixty pounds.
L235741	u1086	m71	DODGE	How about now?
L235730	u1086	m71	DODGE	Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
L235729	u1088	m71	GREER	You think the extra strain caused it?
L235714	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
L235713	u1086	m71	DODGE	They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
L235712	u1088	m71	GREER	Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
L235575	u1086	m71	DODGE	With that coxswain dickhead.
L235574	u1088	m71	GREER	Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
L235549	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
L235548	u1088	m71	GREER	Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
L236215	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, yeah.
L236214	u1087	m71	EPPS	Get up.
L236213	u1086	m71	DODGE	What?
L236212	u1087	m71	EPPS	Dodge.  Dodge.
L236162	u1087	m71	EPPS	Why not?
L236161	u1086	m71	DODGE	What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
L236100	u1086	m71	DODGE	Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
L236099	u1087	m71	EPPS	Did you?
L236083	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right. Wednesday.
L236082	u1087	m71	EPPS	Try Wednesday.
L236018	u1086	m71	DODGE	Then what the hell happened to him?
L236017	u1087	m71	EPPS	Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
L236015	u1086	m71	DODGE	I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
L236014	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
L236013	u1086	m71	DODGE	A what?
L236012	u1087	m71	EPPS	I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
L235960	u1087	m71	EPPS	Oh yeah.
L235959	u1086	m71	DODGE	Smokes?
L235952	u1087	m71	EPPS	Seen a lota movies.
L235951	u1086	m71	DODGE	Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
L235939	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe he isn't alone.
L235938	u1086	m71	DODGE	One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
L235934	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
L235933	u1087	m71	EPPS	So we kill him?
L235932	u1086	m71	DODGE	Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
L235923	u1086	m71	DODGE	Gimme a break.
L235922	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe that is his boat.
L235917	u1087	m71	EPPS	I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
L235916	u1086	m71	DODGE	Light in those passages ain't so good.
L235885	u1087	m71	EPPS	I like my job.
L235884	u1086	m71	DODGE	What're you crazy?
L235883	u1087	m71	EPPS	Guess I'll just keep working.
L235875	u1086	m71	DODGE	I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
L235874	u1087	m71	EPPS	What other choices have we got?
L235870	u1086	m71	DODGE	Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
L235869	u1087	m71	EPPS	This's gonna hurt a little.
L235851	u1087	m71	EPPS	Or uninvited guests.
L235850	u1086	m71	DODGE	Last thing we want is extra partners.
L235800	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
L235799	u1087	m71	EPPS	If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
L235718	u1087	m71	EPPS	Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
L235717	u1086	m71	DODGE	Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
L235698	u1087	m71	EPPS	Bring it on, dude.
L235697	u1086	m71	DODGE	Ready?
L235696	u1086	m71	DODGE	Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
L235695	u1087	m71	EPPS	Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
L235694	u1086	m71	DODGE	Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
L235666	u1086	m71	DODGE	Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
L235665	u1087	m71	EPPS	Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
L235664	u1086	m71	DODGE	Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
L235623	u1087	m71	EPPS	No.
L235622	u1086	m71	DODGE	You think that's funny
L235621	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah.
L235620	u1087	m71	EPPS	Roger?
L235619	u1086	m71	DODGE	Roger.
L235617	u1086	m71	DODGE	Maureen?
L235616	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maureen.
L235615	u1086	m71	DODGE	What?
L235614	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maureen.
L235613	u1086	m71	DODGE	It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
L235612	u1087	m71	EPPS	What?
L235611	u1086	m71	DODGE	What is your first name?
L235610	u1086	m71	DODGE	Why not.
L235609	u1087	m71	EPPS	One more?
L235547	u1087	m71	EPPS	Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
L235546	u1086	m71	DODGE	Where from?
L236219	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right.
L236218	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Don't fall asleep.
L236217	u1086	m71	DODGE	Sorry.
L236216	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You're late.
L236159	u1086	m71	DODGE	There's a charming thought.
L236158	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
L236146	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right.
L236145	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
L236144	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Then you're a lucky man.
L236143	u1086	m71	DODGE	I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
L236142	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If money can buy what he wants.
L236141	u1086	m71	DODGE	That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
L236118	u1086	m71	DODGE	Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
L236117	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What the hell happened!
L236116	u1086	m71	DODGE	You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
L236115	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Yeah.
L236065	u1086	m71	DODGE	Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
L236064	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Conveniently enough for you.
L236063	u1086	m71	DODGE	I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
L236062	u1086	m71	DODGE	I didn't touch the fucking radio.
L236061	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
L236060	u1086	m71	DODGE	What the fuck -- ?
L236059	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Don't lie to me!
L236058	u1086	m71	DODGE	What?!
L236057	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You smashed it!
L236056	u1086	m71	DODGE	Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
L236055	u1086	m71	DODGE	The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
L236054	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The radio!
L236053	u1086	m71	DODGE	Maybe you can tell me then.
L236052	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think you know.
L236051	u1086	m71	DODGE	I don't know what you're talking about?
L236050	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
L236048	u1086	m71	DODGE	With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
L236047	u1089	m71	MURPHY	There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
L236046	u1086	m71	DODGE	For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
L236045	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What do you propose?
L236044	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
L236043	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
L236042	u1086	m71	DODGE	Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
L236041	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How do you mean?
L236040	u1086	m71	DODGE	So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
L236035	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If they knew what they were carrying.
L236034	u1086	m71	DODGE	On a passenger ship in 1953?
L236023	u1086	m71	DODGE	Not me.
L236022	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
L236008	u1086	m71	DODGE	I think you better see this for yourself.
L236007	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What is it?
L236006	u1086	m71	DODGE	"You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on ""C"" deck. Cabin 400."
L236005	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Murphy.
L236004	u1086	m71	DODGE	Dodge to Murphy.
L235989	u1086	m71	DODGE	Right.
L235988	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
L235987	u1086	m71	DODGE	I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
L235986	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Can't you use something else?
L235978	u1086	m71	DODGE	So whoever did this might still be around.
L235977	u1089	m71	MURPHY	That'd be my guess.
L235974	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Could be meant as a warning.
L235973	u1086	m71	DODGE	Damn barbaric is what it is.
L235970	u1086	m71	DODGE	Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
L235969	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Bodies're too fresh.
L235950	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
L235949	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
L235943	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
L235942	u1086	m71	DODGE	What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
L235931	u1086	m71	DODGE	Why not? Why the fuck not?
L235930	u1089	m71	MURPHY	And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
L235929	u1086	m71	DODGE	I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
L235926	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not in the eyes of the law.
L235925	u1086	m71	DODGE	Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
L235924	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
L235900	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
L235899	u1086	m71	DODGE	Sounds like the hull.
L235895	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, yeah.
L235894	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
L235882	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How about you Epps?
L235881	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
L235855	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
L235854	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
L235845	u1089	m71	MURPHY	So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
L235844	u1086	m71	DODGE	You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
L235841	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It looks like it.
L235840	u1086	m71	DODGE	Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
L235839	u1089	m71	MURPHY	A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
L235838	u1086	m71	DODGE	So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
L235836	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
L235835	u1086	m71	DODGE	Or somebody stopped them.
L235829	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Then it happened before they scuttled her.
L235828	u1086	m71	DODGE	Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
L235821	u1089	m71	MURPHY	A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
L235820	u1086	m71	DODGE	What, you think there's something funny about it?
L235819	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's a hell of a lot of money.
L235810	u1089	m71	MURPHY	She take a radio?
L235809	u1086	m71	DODGE	Went aboard.
L235796	u1086	m71	DODGE	Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
L235795	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
L235782	u1086	m71	DODGE	What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
L235781	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Goddamit, Dodge.
L235780	u1086	m71	DODGE	Three, four days.
L235779	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How long?
L235778	u1086	m71	DODGE	I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
L235777	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How long, then?
L235776	u1086	m71	DODGE	It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
L235775	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What about running number two by itself?
L235774	u1086	m71	DODGE	I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
L235773	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
L235772	u1086	m71	DODGE	Hard to say.
L235771	u1089	m71	MURPHY	But how long?
L235770	u1086	m71	DODGE	The right way and the wrong way.
L235769	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I know I know, two ways to do anything --
L235768	u1086	m71	DODGE	Like I always say --
L235767	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How much longer's that gonna take?
L235766	u1086	m71	DODGE	Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
L235765	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I thought you said it was just a blade.
L235764	u1086	m71	DODGE	Turbine rotor's shot.
L235763	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What's this?
L235728	u1086	m71	DODGE	Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
L235727	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How long to fix?
L235726	u1086	m71	DODGE	The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
L235724	u1086	m71	DODGE	Threw a turbine blade.
L235723	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What is it?
L235722	u1086	m71	DODGE	Mother fucker!
L235711	u1086	m71	DODGE	Sounds reasonable.
L235710	u1089	m71	MURPHY	With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
L235677	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
L235676	u1086	m71	DODGE	It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
L235673	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's a risk I'm willing to take.
L235672	u1086	m71	DODGE	If you get it back in one piece.
L235671	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
L235670	u1086	m71	DODGE	Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
L235637	u1086	m71	DODGE	Smugglers maybe.
L235636	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
L235577	u1086	m71	DODGE	Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
L235576	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
L236263	u1088	m71	GREER	I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
L236262	u1087	m71	EPPS	I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
L236251	u1087	m71	EPPS	Nothing. Let's get outa here.
L236250	u1088	m71	GREER	What?
L236249	u1087	m71	EPPS	Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
L236248	u1088	m71	GREER	You okay?
L236231	u1087	m71	EPPS	Better than starving to death.
L236230	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
L236078	u1088	m71	GREER	I feel fine.
L236077	u1087	m71	EPPS	Sudden flashes of light.
L236076	u1088	m71	GREER	Lights?
L236075	u1087	m71	EPPS	Headache, nausea, lights?
L236074	u1088	m71	GREER	No.
L236073	u1087	m71	EPPS	Any dizziness?
L235976	u1087	m71	EPPS	Because of the gold.
L235975	u1088	m71	GREER	Stay away. Or else.
L235956	u1087	m71	EPPS	You're a pal.
L235955	u1088	m71	GREER	Coffee.
L235919	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
L235918	u1088	m71	GREER	What'd he look like?
L235891	u1088	m71	GREER	Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
L235890	u1087	m71	EPPS	That's a good thing?
L235859	u1088	m71	GREER	Hell yeah.
L235858	u1087	m71	EPPS	That's what I call a payday.
L235857	u1088	m71	GREER	Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
L235834	u1087	m71	EPPS	Probably didn't have time.
L235833	u1088	m71	GREER	Then why didn't they take it.
L235831	u1088	m71	GREER	Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
L235830	u1087	m71	EPPS	You mean, before she sank.
L235740	u1088	m71	GREER	He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
L235739	u1087	m71	EPPS	Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
L235635	u1088	m71	GREER	Too big. More like a freighter.
L235634	u1087	m71	EPPS	Could be a fishing boat.
L235603	u1088	m71	GREER	I bet you did.
L235602	u1087	m71	EPPS	Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
L235601	u1088	m71	GREER	Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
L235600	u1087	m71	EPPS	Morning everybody.
L235545	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
L235544	u1088	m71	GREER	What's slow?
L236333	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
L236332	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't give a damn about the gold.
L236331	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
L236330	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
L236329	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
L236328	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
L236327	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think I see it pretty well.
L236326	u1087	m71	EPPS	Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
L236325	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I didn't want it to turn out this way.
L236324	u1087	m71	EPPS	And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
L236323	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
L236322	u1087	m71	EPPS	So you killed them?
L236321	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
L236320	u1087	m71	EPPS	You killed them.
L236313	u1087	m71	EPPS	Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
L236312	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
L236311	u1087	m71	EPPS	What?
L236310	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We hit land.
L236309	u1087	m71	EPPS	What happened?
L236283	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
L236282	u1087	m71	EPPS	If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
L236281	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
L236279	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
L236278	u1087	m71	EPPS	They went crazy.
L236277	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe it was more than that.
L236276	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Over the gold.
L236275	u1087	m71	EPPS	"Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. ""Like wild dogs."""
L236274	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What do you think?
L236256	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
L236255	u1087	m71	EPPS	What do we do with him?
L236243	u1087	m71	EPPS	Right here.
L236242	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Epps? You there?
L236236	u1089	m71	MURPHY	He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
L236235	u1087	m71	EPPS	Nope.
L236234	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Either of you seen Dodge?
L236233	u1087	m71	EPPS	Epps, over.
L236232	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Murphy to Epps.
L236207	u1087	m71	EPPS	Just lucky I guess.
L236206	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
L236205	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't know.
L236204	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What's that supposed to mean?
L236203	u1087	m71	EPPS	She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
L236202	u1087	m71	EPPS	More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
L236201	u1089	m71	MURPHY	That much I think we've already established.
L236200	u1087	m71	EPPS	Something bad happened here, Murphy.
L236199	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Victims of what?
L236198	u1087	m71	EPPS	No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
L236197	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
L236196	u1087	m71	EPPS	What happened.
L236195	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Showing you what?
L236194	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
L236192	u1087	m71	EPPS	I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
L236191	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What, like some kind of ghost?
L236189	u1087	m71	EPPS	No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
L236188	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not our mystery guest again.
L236187	u1087	m71	EPPS	When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
L236186	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I don't know, are we?
L236185	u1087	m71	EPPS	Are we smart enough to avoid that?
L236184	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
L236183	u1087	m71	EPPS	The what?
L236182	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
L236181	u1087	m71	EPPS	What do you think happened on this boat?
L236180	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Wish I could say the same.
L236179	u1087	m71	EPPS	Couldn't sleep.
L236178	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Hey.
L236177	u1087	m71	EPPS	Hey.
L236174	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Doesn't matter.
L236173	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's not gonna hold us.
L236127	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
L236126	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
L236113	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If it was a ship she hit.
L236112	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
L236111	u1089	m71	MURPHY	But where's the damage?
L236110	u1087	m71	EPPS	The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
L236109	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Collision? With what?
L236108	u1087	m71	EPPS	Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made.
L236107	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
L236106	u1087	m71	EPPS	The same day she supposedly went down.
L236105	u1089	m71	MURPHY	February first.
L236104	u1087	m71	EPPS	The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill.
L236097	u1087	m71	EPPS	But, who -- ?
L236096	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Smashed it up pretty bad.
L236095	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Somebody took it out of commission last night.
L236094	u1087	m71	EPPS	What?
L236093	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The ah... the radio's out.
L236038	u1087	m71	EPPS	Only something must've gone wrong.
L236037	u1089	m71	MURPHY	If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
L236036	u1087	m71	EPPS	You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
L236033	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
L236032	u1087	m71	EPPS	They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
L236031	u1089	m71	MURPHY	No. I'll try again later.
L236030	u1087	m71	EPPS	Same. Any luck?
L236029	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How's he doing?
L236025	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
L236024	u1087	m71	EPPS	He needs a doctor.
L236021	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
L236020	u1087	m71	EPPS	Greer?
L236019	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
L235966	u1087	m71	EPPS	Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
L235965	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You just shoot at something?
L235964	u1087	m71	EPPS	Epps.
L235963	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Murphy to Epps.
L235958	u1087	m71	EPPS	Yup.
L235957	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Got your light?
L235954	u1087	m71	EPPS	No cowboy shit. Right.
L235953	u1089	m71	MURPHY	No cowboy shit up there, understand?
L235945	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
L235944	u1087	m71	EPPS	Guess that'd be me. Again.
L235928	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
L235927	u1087	m71	EPPS	So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
L235915	u1087	m71	EPPS	It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
L235914	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You sure it wasn't me?
L235913	u1087	m71	EPPS	Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
L235912	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Are you sure?
L235911	u1087	m71	EPPS	I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
L235910	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What? What the hell're you talking about.
L235909	u1087	m71	EPPS	There's somebody else on this boat.
L235908	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What guy?
L235907	u1087	m71	EPPS	The guy. He just came this way.
L235906	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Who?
L235905	u1087	m71	EPPS	Did you see him?
L235904	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Take it easy, you'll live longer.
L235849	u1089	m71	MURPHY	For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
L235848	u1087	m71	EPPS	Why not call for help?
L235825	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
L235824	u1087	m71	EPPS	Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
L235762	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Only way to be.
L235761	u1087	m71	EPPS	You're more practical than superstitious.
L235760	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
L235759	u1087	m71	EPPS	You think she's sailing without a crew?
L235758	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
L235757	u1087	m71	EPPS	So what did happen?
L235756	u1089	m71	MURPHY	She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
L235755	u1087	m71	EPPS	Nope.
L235754	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
L235752	u1087	m71	EPPS	Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
L235751	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
L235750	u1087	m71	EPPS	She was sailing up north, right?
L235749	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
L235748	u1087	m71	EPPS	What'd you find up there?
L235747	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Yeah. Thanks.
L235746	u1087	m71	EPPS	Coffee?
L235716	u1087	m71	EPPS	They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
L235715	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
L235680	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
L235679	u1087	m71	EPPS	Go on.
L235605	u1087	m71	EPPS	It's my pen name.
L235604	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Candy?
L236265	u1088	m71	GREER	Fine with me.
L236264	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
L236261	u1088	m71	GREER	All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
L236260	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You think whoever did this is reasonable?
L236259	u1088	m71	GREER	Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
L236258	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Leave it.
L236257	u1088	m71	GREER	What about the gold?
L236254	u1088	m71	GREER	Doesn't look like it much matters.
L236253	u1089	m71	MURPHY	So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
L236252	u1088	m71	GREER	Can't find the shotgun.
L236238	u1088	m71	GREER	Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
L236237	u1089	m71	MURPHY	He took the shotgun and a light.
L236172	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The mooring hasn't come taught.
L236171	u1088	m71	GREER	We're still drifting.
L236168	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
L236167	u1088	m71	GREER	A what?
L236166	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's a Noaa buoy.
L236135	u1088	m71	GREER	Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
L236134	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Shut up.
L236133	u1088	m71	GREER	Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
L236125	u1089	m71	MURPHY	The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
L236124	u1088	m71	GREER	We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
L236120	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
L236119	u1088	m71	GREER	We're not gonna be able to pump it!
L236092	u1088	m71	GREER	I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
L236091	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
L236090	u1088	m71	GREER	Oh, man.
L236089	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
L236088	u1088	m71	GREER	Say what?
L236087	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You've been out for about a day.
L236086	u1088	m71	GREER	Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
L236085	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You don't remember?
L236084	u1088	m71	GREER	What happened?
L236072	u1088	m71	GREER	Lost my sea legs.
L236071	u1089	m71	MURPHY	How're you feeling?
L236070	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Drink up then.
L236069	u1088	m71	GREER	Never been more thirsty in my life.
L235980	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Maybe.
L235979	u1088	m71	GREER	Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
L235972	u1088	m71	GREER	And look what happened.
L235971	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
L235968	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
L235967	u1088	m71	GREER	Ho-ly shit.
L235947	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
L235946	u1088	m71	GREER	Pretty low all around.
L235941	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
L235940	u1088	m71	GREER	I say we off-load some of that gold now.
L235937	u1088	m71	GREER	Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
L235936	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
L235935	u1088	m71	GREER	I don't know.
L235887	u1088	m71	GREER	Moving to Sweden.
L235886	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Greer?
L235880	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
L235879	u1088	m71	GREER	Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
L235873	u1088	m71	GREER	And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
L235872	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We could call for help.
L235871	u1088	m71	GREER	What now?
L235853	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
L235852	u1088	m71	GREER	I heard that.
L235847	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
L235846	u1088	m71	GREER	Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
L235843	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
L235842	u1088	m71	GREER	So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
L235823	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
L235822	u1088	m71	GREER	If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
L235816	u1088	m71	GREER	Ho, baby!
L235815	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
L235814	u1088	m71	GREER	How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
L235808	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
L235807	u1088	m71	GREER	You're up late.
L235806	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Morning.
L235732	u1088	m71	GREER	Yeah.
L235731	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
L235675	u1089	m71	MURPHY	So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
L235674	u1088	m71	GREER	All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
L235669	u1089	m71	MURPHY	We've done it before.
L235668	u1088	m71	GREER	You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
L235667	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
L235660	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Sorry.
L235659	u1088	m71	GREER	Murphy, goddamit.
L235655	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
L235654	u1088	m71	GREER	How's that?
L235653	u1089	m71	MURPHY	It's funny.
L235641	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
L235640	u1088	m71	GREER	Call the Coastguard?
L235633	u1088	m71	GREER	Looks like it's adrift.
L235632	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Too deep to anchor out there.
L235628	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Alright. I'll be right up.
L235627	u1088	m71	GREER	I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
L235626	u1088	m71	GREER	There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
L235625	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Yeah.
L235607	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
L235606	u1088	m71	GREER	Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
L235572	u1088	m71	GREER	"Better than ""making hamburger for Mickey D."""
L235571	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You got that right.
L235570	u1088	m71	GREER	I must be in the wrong business.
L235569	u1089	m71	MURPHY	He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
L235568	u1088	m71	GREER	Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
L235555	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What do you say, Dodge?
L235554	u1088	m71	GREER	Let the buyer beware.
L235553	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Of course they did.
L235552	u1088	m71	GREER	The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
L235551	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Go.
L235550	u1088	m71	GREER	Greer to Murphy.
L235594	u1090	m71	RIVETER	Or what?
L235593	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
L235592	u1090	m71	RIVETER	These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
L235591	u1089	m71	MURPHY	I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
L235590	u1090	m71	RIVETER	Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
L235589	u1089	m71	MURPHY	As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
L235588	u1090	m71	RIVETER	Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
L235587	u1089	m71	MURPHY	What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
L235567	u1091	m71	VASILI	You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
L235566	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You're kidding, right?
L235565	u1091	m71	VASILI	Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
L235564	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Fifteen, at the most.
L235563	u1091	m71	VASILI	That cost me twenty grand at least.
L235562	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
L235561	u1091	m71	VASILI	No, no. You got leak.
L235560	u1089	m71	MURPHY	You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
L235559	u1091	m71	VASILI	What's this?
L235558	u1089	m71	MURPHY	Better late than never.
L235557	u1091	m71	VASILI	I thought you say Tuesday.
L328490	u1555	m104	AL	I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
L328489	u1568	m104	JIM	Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
L328460	u1555	m104	AL	Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc...
L328459	u1568	m104	JIM	William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
L328435	u1555	m104	AL	Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
L328434	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
L328433	u1555	m104	AL	"The U.S. Attorney in Washington ""declines"" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named."
L328316	u1568	m104	JIM	Not one word.  That's an order.
L328315	u1555	m104	AL	When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
L328314	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
L328228	u1555	m104	AL	My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
L328227	u1568	m104	JIM	Susie, watch the language, would you please.
L327970	u1568	m104	JIM	The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
L327969	u1555	m104	AL	If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
L327839	u1568	m104	JIM	Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
L327838	u1555	m104	AL	Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
L327895	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
L327894	u1568	m104	JIM	Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
L327893	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	There were no phone records.
L327892	u1568	m104	JIM	Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
L327891	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
L327890	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
L327889	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
L327888	u1568	m104	JIM	Recall any names?
L327887	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
L327886	u1568	m104	JIM	So you saw Oswald how many times?
L327885	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
L327884	u1568	m104	JIM	And Oswald?
L327883	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
L327882	u1568	m104	JIM	Did he pay?
L327881	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
L327880	u1568	m104	JIM	What was his voice like?
L327874	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
L327873	u1568	m104	JIM	Street cats?
L327872	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
L327871	u1568	m104	JIM	When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
L327870	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
L327869	u1568	m104	JIM	Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
L327867	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
L327866	u1568	m104	JIM	Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
L327865	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Right.
L327864	u1568	m104	JIM	"You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this ""Clay Bertrand"" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer."
L327863	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
L327862	u1568	m104	JIM	Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
L327861	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
L327533	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
L327532	u1557	m104	BANISTER	I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
L327531	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
L327530	u1557	m104	BANISTER	You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
L327529	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
L327528	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
L327527	u1557	m104	BANISTER	I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
L327526	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
L327525	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
L327524	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
L327523	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
L327522	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
L327513	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
L327512	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
L327511	u1557	m104	BANISTER	A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
L327510	u1577	m104	MARTIN	God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
L327509	u1557	m104	BANISTER	All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
L328472	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
L328471	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
L327998	u1586	m104	SUSIE	No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
L327997	u1558	m104	BILL	Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
L327996	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Who?
L327796	u1586	m104	SUSIE	You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
L327795	u1558	m104	BILL	Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
L327794	u1586	m104	SUSIE	I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
L327784	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
L327783	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
L328283	u1563	m104	FRANK	Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
L328282	u1558	m104	BILL	No, I'm not...
L328281	u1563	m104	FRANK	Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
L328280	u1563	m104	FRANK	Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
L328279	u1558	m104	BILL	Frank, I don't want to hear it.
L328278	u1563	m104	FRANK	You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
L328277	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah, I guess you do.
L328276	u1563	m104	FRANK	Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
L328275	u1558	m104	BILL	Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
L328274	u1563	m104	FRANK	It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
L328273	u1558	m104	BILL	Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
L328272	u1563	m104	FRANK	Bill.
L328447	u1574	m104	LOU	You're not digging.
L328446	u1558	m104	BILL	Keep saying what?
L328445	u1574	m104	LOU	You know you keep saying that.
L328444	u1558	m104	BILL	...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
L328443	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
L328266	u1558	m104	BILL	With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
L328265	u1574	m104	LOU	Not unless we go for Shaw now.
L328264	u1558	m104	BILL	The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
L328248	u1574	m104	LOU	Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
L328247	u1558	m104	BILL	"It's addressed to no one and no signature.  ""To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."""
L327842	u1558	m104	BILL	You, Numa?
L327841	u1574	m104	LOU	I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
L327840	u1558	m104	BILL	What do you think, Lou?
L327612	u1558	m104	BILL	Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
L327611	u1574	m104	LOU	Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
L327987	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
L327986	u1558	m104	BILL	So why does he call himself Bertrand?
L327985	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
L327984	u1558	m104	BILL	Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
L327983	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
L327982	u1558	m104	BILL	What's the other name?
L327981	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
L327980	u1558	m104	BILL	Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
L327979	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
L327925	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	"...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know ""beatnik"" type things."
L327924	u1558	m104	BILL	Go on, Willie.
L327923	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
L327916	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
L327915	u1558	m104	BILL	And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
L327914	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
L327911	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
L327910	u1558	m104	BILL	Did he pay you for this?
L327907	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
L327906	u1558	m104	BILL	Clay Bertrand, Willie?
L328484	u1558	m104	BILL	This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
L328483	u1568	m104	JIM	"Julius Caesar:  ""Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men.""  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA..."
L328482	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah.
L328481	u1568	m104	JIM	With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
L328480	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
L328479	u1568	m104	JIM	If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
L328478	u1558	m104	BILL	Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
L328477	u1568	m104	JIM	I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
L328476	u1558	m104	BILL	Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
L328475	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
L328474	u1558	m104	BILL	So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
L328473	u1568	m104	JIM	Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
L328470	u1568	m104	JIM	There's a word - orders.
L328469	u1558	m104	BILL	I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
L328271	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
L328270	u1558	m104	BILL	Where you going, boss?
L328269	u1568	m104	JIM	All right, all right.  Break it up.
L328257	u1568	m104	JIM	Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
L328256	u1558	m104	BILL	"Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  ""When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."""
L328224	u1558	m104	BILL	Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
L328223	u1568	m104	JIM	Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
L328187	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
L328186	u1558	m104	BILL	"That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a ""White Paper"" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss..."
L328002	u1568	m104	JIM	I think we should have him in for a little talk.
L328001	u1558	m104	BILL	That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
L328000	u1568	m104	JIM	Can you get some sworn statements?
L327837	u1568	m104	JIM	Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
L327836	u1558	m104	BILL	I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
L327833	u1568	m104	JIM	To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
L327832	u1558	m104	BILL	But why?
L327831	u1568	m104	JIM	"It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - ""a patsy"".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, ""O.H. Lee"" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?"
L327830	u1558	m104	BILL	He had his palm print on the weapon.
L327829	u1568	m104	JIM	I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
L327828	u1558	m104	BILL	And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
L327827	u1568	m104	JIM	We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
L327826	u1558	m104	BILL	I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
L327761	u1558	m104	BILL	Gee, thanks boss.
L327760	u1568	m104	JIM	The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
L327759	u1558	m104	BILL	And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
L327758	u1568	m104	JIM	When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
L327757	u1558	m104	BILL	He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
L327756	u1568	m104	JIM	Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
L327755	u1558	m104	BILL	Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
L327710	u1568	m104	JIM	No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
L327709	u1558	m104	BILL	Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
L327697	u1568	m104	JIM	Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
L327696	u1558	m104	BILL	What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
L327678	u1568	m104	JIM	Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
L327677	u1558	m104	BILL	At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
L327676	u1568	m104	JIM	Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
L327567	u1558	m104	BILL	The anonymous kind, Chief.
L327566	u1568	m104	JIM	Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
L328263	u1559	m104	CORONER	If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
L328262	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
L328261	u1559	m104	CORONER	Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
L328260	u1568	m104	JIM	Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
L328259	u1559	m104	CORONER	He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
L328258	u1568	m104	JIM	Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
L328246	u1559	m104	CORONER	I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
L328245	u1568	m104	JIM	What's it look like, Nick?
L328616	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
L328615	u1560	m104	DYMOND	I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
L328614	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
L328613	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Why?
L328612	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	I did.
L328611	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
L328642	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
L328641	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328640	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
L328639	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
L328638	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
L328637	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328636	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...ever called Dean Andrews?
L328635	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328634	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...Oswald?
L328163	u1561	m104	FERRIE	"They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out ""Alan Pope"" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called ""Mongoose""  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  ""Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."""
L328162	u1574	m104	LOU	What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
L328147	u1561	m104	FERRIE	"Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A ""wanna be,"" y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me."
L328146	u1574	m104	LOU	What do you mean?
L328145	u1561	m104	FERRIE	That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
L328144	u1574	m104	LOU	Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
L328143	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
L328142	u1574	m104	LOU	"Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I""m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready."
L328134	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
L328133	u1574	m104	LOU	Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
L328132	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
L328122	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
L328121	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
L328120	u1561	m104	FERRIE	...give me protection?
L328119	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
L328118	u1561	m104	FERRIE	The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
L328117	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
L328116	u1561	m104	FERRIE	It leads farther than that.
L328115	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
L328114	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You still questioning any Cubans?
L328113	u1574	m104	LOU	What did they...
L328112	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
L328111	u1574	m104	LOU	What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
L328110	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
L328109	u1574	m104	LOU	Calm down, Dave, what?
L328108	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
L328107	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
L328106	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
L328105	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave?
L328104	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You know damn well who it is.
L328170	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
L328169	u1568	m104	JIM	Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
L328168	u1561	m104	FERRIE	They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
L328167	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
L328166	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
L328165	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
L328164	u1568	m104	JIM	Then who killed the President?
L328161	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
L328160	u1568	m104	JIM	What about Ruby?
L328159	u1561	m104	FERRIE	"Shaw's an ""untouchable"", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency."
L328158	u1568	m104	JIM	And Shaw?
L328157	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
L328156	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
L328155	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
L328154	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
L328153	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
L328152	u1568	m104	JIM	Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
L328149	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
L328148	u1568	m104	JIM	Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
L328140	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
L328139	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
L328138	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
L328137	u1568	m104	JIM	Who was paying you, Dave?
L328136	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
L328135	u1568	m104	JIM	You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
L327922	u1568	m104	JIM	"Would you say this ""Leon"" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?"
L327921	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
L327607	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
L327606	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Why?  What's wrong?
L327605	u1568	m104	JIM	I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
L327604	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
L327603	u1568	m104	JIM	Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
L327602	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
L327601	u1568	m104	JIM	But the boys told us they didn't get any.
L327600	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I believe the boys got a couple.
L327599	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you bag any geese on this trip?
L327598	u1561	m104	FERRIE	In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
L327597	u1568	m104	JIM	And then Sunday?
L327596	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
L327595	u1568	m104	JIM	Why Galveston?
L327594	u1561	m104	FERRIE	We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
L327593	u1568	m104	JIM	I see.  And where did you drive?
L327592	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
L327591	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
L327590	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
L327589	u1568	m104	JIM	What was so appealing about Houston?
L327588	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
L327587	u1568	m104	JIM	Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
L327586	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No, I never saw him before in my life.
L327585	u1568	m104	JIM	I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
L327584	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
L327583	u1568	m104	JIM	But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
L327582	u1561	m104	FERRIE	That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
L327581	u1568	m104	JIM	How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
L327580	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
L327579	u1568	m104	JIM	How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
L327578	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
L327577	u1568	m104	JIM	Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
L328676	u1562	m104	FINCK	Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
L328675	u1568	m104	JIM	There were admirals.
L328674	u1562	m104	FINCK	No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
L328673	u1568	m104	JIM	But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
L328672	u1562	m104	FINCK	No.
L328671	u1568	m104	JIM	But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
L328670	u1562	m104	FINCK	I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
L328667	u1562	m104	FINCK	Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
L328666	u1568	m104	JIM	Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
L328665	u1562	m104	FINCK	I had the cause of death.
L328664	u1568	m104	JIM	As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
L328663	u1562	m104	FINCK	I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
L328662	u1568	m104	JIM	Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
L328631	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
L328630	u1564	m104	GARRISON	I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
L328629	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
L328628	u1564	m104	GARRISON	That's our case!
L328627	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
L328626	u1564	m104	GARRISON	Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
L328622	u1564	m104	GARRISON	What?
L328621	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
L328556	u1568	m104	JIM	There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
L328555	u1566	m104	JASPER	I'm scared.
L328551	u1568	m104	JIM	No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
L328550	u1566	m104	JASPER	Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
L328549	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
L328548	u1566	m104	JASPER	Are we going away, Daddy?
L328077	u1568	m104	JIM	Hi, Freckle Face.
L328076	u1566	m104	JASPER	Daddy!  Where have you been?
L327642	u1566	m104	JASPER	A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
L327641	u1568	m104	JIM	That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
L327640	u1566	m104	JASPER	Dad, look what I drew.
L327632	u1568	m104	JIM	Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
L327631	u1566	m104	JASPER	Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
L328398	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
L328397	u1571	m104	LAWYER	Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
L328396	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
L328395	u1571	m104	LAWYER	I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
L328394	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
L328393	u1571	m104	LAWYER	...you heard echoes.
L328392	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
L328391	u1571	m104	LAWYER	I want the truth.
L328390	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
L328389	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
L328388	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No, you don't!
L328387	u1571	m104	LAWYER	That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
L328386	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
L328385	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
L328384	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
L328383	u1576	m104	MAN	We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
L328382	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
L328381	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
L328380	u1576	m104	MAN	That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
L328379	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Four to six.
L328378	u1576	m104	MAN	How many shots you say you heard?
L328377	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
L328578	u1568	m104	JIM	I know.
L328577	u1586	m104	SUSIE	I'm sorry.
L328499	u1568	m104	JIM	No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
L328498	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Aren't you being a little hard?
L328449	u1586	m104	SUSIE	This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
L328448	u1568	m104	JIM	I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
L328238	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
L328237	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't believe it!
L327989	u1568	m104	JIM	"Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word ""microdots"" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for..."
L327988	u1586	m104	SUSIE	"...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name ""Oswald"" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name ""Oswald"" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity."
L327821	u1568	m104	JIM	"I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying ""We both know who's responsible.""  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?"
L327820	u1586	m104	SUSIE	All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
L327819	u1568	m104	JIM	Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
L327818	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
L327808	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
L327807	u1568	m104	JIM	Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
L327806	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
L327805	u1568	m104	JIM	Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
L327804	u1586	m104	SUSIE	None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
L327803	u1568	m104	JIM	And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
L327802	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
L327801	u1568	m104	JIM	But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
L327800	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
L327799	u1568	m104	JIM	This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
L327798	u1586	m104	SUSIE	None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
L327797	u1568	m104	JIM	Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
L327791	u1586	m104	SUSIE	But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
L327790	u1568	m104	JIM	Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
L327789	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
L327782	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
L327781	u1568	m104	JIM	If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
L328072	u1585	m104	SHAW	Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
L328071	u1568	m104	JIM	I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
L328070	u1585	m104	SHAW	May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
L328069	u1568	m104	JIM	No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
L328068	u1585	m104	SHAW	And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
L328067	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
L328066	u1585	m104	SHAW	Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
L328065	u1568	m104	JIM	...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
L328064	u1585	m104	SHAW	Nonsense.  What next?
L328063	u1568	m104	JIM	It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
L328062	u1585	m104	SHAW	I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
L328061	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
L328060	u1585	m104	SHAW	Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
L328059	u1568	m104	JIM	Please answer the question.
L328058	u1585	m104	SHAW	You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
L328057	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
L328056	u1585	m104	SHAW	Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
L328055	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
L328048	u1585	m104	SHAW	One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
L328047	u1568	m104	JIM	No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
L328046	u1585	m104	SHAW	Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
L328045	u1568	m104	JIM	Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
L328044	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
L328043	u1568	m104	JIM	Let me show you his picture. 
L328040	u1568	m104	JIM	...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
L328039	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
L328038	u1568	m104	JIM	David Ferrie.
L328037	u1585	m104	SHAW	Who?
L328036	u1568	m104	JIM	...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
L328035	u1585	m104	SHAW	Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
L328034	u1568	m104	JIM	After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
L328033	u1585	m104	SHAW	"It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering ""Frankie!"" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?"
L328032	u1568	m104	JIM	I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
L328031	u1585	m104	SHAW	Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
L328030	u1568	m104	JIM	Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
L328028	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
L328027	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
L328026	u1568	m104	JIM	A Willie O'Keefe?
L328025	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.
L328024	u1568	m104	JIM	A Perry Russo?
L328023	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  Never heard of him.
L328022	u1568	m104	JIM	We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
L328021	u1585	m104	SHAW	I wouldn't imagine where.
L328020	u1568	m104	JIM	Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
L328019	u1585	m104	SHAW	I'm not sure I understand.
L328346	u1578	m104	MERCER	I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
L328345	u1568	m104	JIM	Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
L328344	u1578	m104	MERCER	"This says ""Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck.""  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all..."
L328343	u1578	m104	MERCER	That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
L328342	u1568	m104	JIM	But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
L328341	u1578	m104	MERCER	"That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, ""that was the man I saw in the truck."""
L328340	u1568	m104	JIM	You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
L328332	u1578	m104	MERCER	Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
L328331	u1568	m104	JIM	In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
L328598	u1572	m104	LIZ	Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
L328597	u1568	m104	JIM	He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
L328596	u1572	m104	LIZ	Huh?
L328595	u1568	m104	JIM	They killed him, honey.
L328591	u1572	m104	LIZ	I don't think so, Jim...
L328590	u1568	m104	JIM	I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
L328589	u1572	m104	LIZ	And if you're wrong?
L328546	u1572	m104	LIZ	You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
L328545	u1568	m104	JIM	"Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and ""I'm jes fine honey.""  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not ""fine"" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away."
L328544	u1572	m104	LIZ	Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
L328543	u1568	m104	JIM	That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
L328542	u1572	m104	LIZ	"I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid ""trial""! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?"
L328541	u1568	m104	JIM	Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
L328540	u1572	m104	LIZ	I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
L328539	u1568	m104	JIM	Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
L328538	u1572	m104	LIZ	Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
L328537	u1568	m104	JIM	I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
L328536	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
L328535	u1568	m104	JIM	I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
L328534	u1572	m104	LIZ	You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
L328533	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
L328532	u1572	m104	LIZ	I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
L328531	u1568	m104	JIM	Get a hold of yourself.
L328530	u1572	m104	LIZ	How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
L328529	u1568	m104	JIM	Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
L328528	u1572	m104	LIZ	Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
L328527	u1568	m104	JIM	Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
L328526	u1572	m104	LIZ	Your daughter's life was just threatened!
L328525	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
L328524	u1572	m104	LIZ	A man just called.  He asked her everything!
L328523	u1568	m104	JIM	What?
L328522	u1572	m104	LIZ	Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
L328131	u1572	m104	LIZ	Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
L328130	u1568	m104	JIM	Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
L328127	u1568	m104	JIM	Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
L328126	u1572	m104	LIZ	It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
L328125	u1568	m104	JIM	Did they live?
L328087	u1568	m104	JIM	It's going to get worse, honey.
L328086	u1572	m104	LIZ	That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
L328085	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
L328084	u1572	m104	LIZ	"I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, ""Where's Daddy?""  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!"
L328083	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
L328082	u1572	m104	LIZ	We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
L328081	u1568	m104	JIM	Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
L328080	u1572	m104	LIZ	My sympathies.
L328079	u1568	m104	JIM	Tough day.
L328078	u1572	m104	LIZ	Hi.
L328016	u1568	m104	JIM	Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
L328015	u1572	m104	LIZ	You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
L328014	u1568	m104	JIM	I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
L328013	u1572	m104	LIZ	Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
L328012	u1568	m104	JIM	Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
L328011	u1572	m104	LIZ	But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
L328010	u1568	m104	JIM	No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
L328007	u1568	m104	JIM	You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
L328006	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
L328004	u1568	m104	JIM	It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
L328003	u1572	m104	LIZ	Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
L327674	u1568	m104	JIM	Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
L327673	u1572	m104	LIZ	Honey, go back to sleep, please!
L327672	u1568	m104	JIM	Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
L327671	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
L327670	u1568	m104	JIM	"And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  ""He only had two more Russian words right than wrong.""  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess."
L327669	u1572	m104	LIZ	These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
L327668	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
L327667	u1572	m104	LIZ	I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
L327666	u1568	m104	JIM	It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
L327665	u1572	m104	LIZ	Honey, you all right? 
L327647	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
L327646	u1572	m104	LIZ	One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
L327639	u1572	m104	LIZ	Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
L327638	u1568	m104	JIM	I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
L327630	u1572	m104	LIZ	Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
L327629	u1568	m104	JIM	Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
L327628	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
L327953	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
L327952	u1568	m104	JIM	No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
L327951	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
L327950	u1568	m104	JIM	You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
L327949	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
L327948	u1568	m104	JIM	Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
L327913	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
L327912	u1568	m104	JIM	Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
L327909	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Well... yeah.
L327908	u1568	m104	JIM	For sexual purposes?
L327905	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
L327904	u1568	m104	JIM	I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
L328497	u1574	m104	LOU	You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
L328496	u1568	m104	JIM	I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
L328495	u1574	m104	LOU	Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
L328494	u1568	m104	JIM	Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
L328493	u1574	m104	LOU	Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
L328492	u1568	m104	JIM	Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
L328491	u1574	m104	LOU	I just plain don't trust him anymore.
L328486	u1568	m104	JIM	We need him back.
L328485	u1574	m104	LOU	Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
L328431	u1574	m104	LOU	You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
L328430	u1568	m104	JIM	Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
L328429	u1574	m104	LOU	They're gonna love you, chief.
L328428	u1568	m104	JIM	Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
L328427	u1574	m104	LOU	Allen Dulles?
L328426	u1568	m104	JIM	His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
L328425	u1574	m104	LOU	The Warren Commission call him?
L328424	u1568	m104	JIM	"General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a ""traitor"".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw."
L328423	u1574	m104	LOU	Who?
L328422	u1568	m104	JIM	Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
L328421	u1574	m104	LOU	No.
L328420	u1568	m104	JIM	You know who the mayor was?
L328419	u1574	m104	LOU	"Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, ""and afterwards there's only the freeway,"" and went home."
L328418	u1568	m104	JIM	Who do you think changed the parade route?
L328415	u1574	m104	LOU	"One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... ""3-2-1...  green!""  Or else ""Abort!  Abort!"""
L328414	u1568	m104	JIM	How many men?
L328413	u1574	m104	LOU	When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
L328410	u1568	m104	JIM	Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
L328409	u1574	m104	LOU	That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
L328408	u1568	m104	JIM	The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
L328407	u1574	m104	LOU	It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
L328406	u1568	m104	JIM	Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
L328405	u1574	m104	LOU	The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
L328404	u1568	m104	JIM	Between six and seven seconds.
L328403	u1574	m104	LOU	Time?
L328252	u1574	m104	LOU	I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
L328251	u1568	m104	JIM	I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
L328231	u1574	m104	LOU	I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
L328230	u1568	m104	JIM	I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
L328229	u1574	m104	LOU	You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
L328090	u1574	m104	LOU	"And it ain't pretty  ...""the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966."
L328089	u1568	m104	JIM	Goddamn Sam!
L327992	u1568	m104	JIM	I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
L327991	u1574	m104	LOU	Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
L327835	u1568	m104	JIM	Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
L327834	u1574	m104	LOU	I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
L327779	u1574	m104	LOU	Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
L327778	u1568	m104	JIM	Can we find her?
L327777	u1574	m104	LOU	There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
L327776	u1568	m104	JIM	We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
L327775	u1574	m104	LOU	Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
L327773	u1574	m104	LOU	...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
L327772	u1568	m104	JIM	Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
L327771	u1574	m104	LOU	...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
L327770	u1574	m104	LOU	A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
L327769	u1568	m104	JIM	I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
L327768	u1574	m104	LOU	They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
L327708	u1568	m104	JIM	We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
L327707	u1574	m104	LOU	What are you driving at, boss?
L327706	u1568	m104	JIM	Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
L327704	u1574	m104	LOU	Once ONI, always ONI?
L327703	u1568	m104	JIM	Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
L327702	u1574	m104	LOU	Post Office.
L327701	u1568	m104	JIM	Take a look across the street.
L327700	u1574	m104	LOU	The Office of Naval Intelligence.
L327699	u1568	m104	JIM	Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
L327698	u1574	m104	LOU	I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
L327680	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
L327679	u1568	m104	JIM	Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
L327560	u1574	m104	LOU	He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
L327559	u1568	m104	JIM	I know David - a strange character.
L327521	u1568	m104	JIM	Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
L327520	u1574	m104	LOU	One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
L327494	u1574	m104	LOU	No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
L327493	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh no!... How bad?
L327492	u1574	m104	LOU	Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
L327491	u1568	m104	JIM	What's wrong, Lou?
L327627	u1573	m104	LONG	Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
L327626	u1568	m104	JIM	Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
L327625	u1573	m104	LONG	Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
L327624	u1568	m104	JIM	You think there were other men involved, Russell?
L327623	u1573	m104	LONG	"If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  ""I'm just a patsy.""  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me."
L327622	u1568	m104	JIM	You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
L327621	u1573	m104	LONG	"Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One ""pristine"" bullet?  That dog don't hunt."
L327620	u1568	m104	JIM	I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
L327618	u1573	m104	LONG	Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
L327617	u1568	m104	JIM	I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
L327616	u1573	m104	LONG	"Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? ""Love Child.""  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House."
L328572	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	No, it can't!
L328571	u1568	m104	JIM	Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
L328570	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Pictures like this don't show up on television!
L328568	u1568	m104	JIM	That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
L328567	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Are they?  Why would they?
L328566	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
L328565	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Some people would say you're paranoid.
L328564	u1568	m104	JIM	Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
L328563	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
L328560	u1568	m104	JIM	I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
L328559	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
L328786	u1588	m104	X	I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
L328785	u1568	m104	JIM	Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
L328784	u1588	m104	X	It never did. 
L328783	u1568	m104	JIM	...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
L328782	u1588	m104	X	"I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say ""protection"" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of ""okay"" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again."
L328781	u1588	m104	X	Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
L328780	u1568	m104	JIM	His name?
L328779	u1588	m104	X	You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
L328778	u1568	m104	JIM	Ever ask him?
L328777	u1588	m104	X	...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
L328776	u1568	m104	JIM	...and your General?
L328775	u1588	m104	X	...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
L328774	u1568	m104	JIM	Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
L328773	u1588	m104	X	He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
L328755	u1588	m104	X	I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
L328754	u1568	m104	JIM	Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
L328753	u1588	m104	X	You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
L328752	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, thanks for coming.
L328309	u1588	m104	X	But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
L328308	u1568	m104	JIM	I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
L328307	u1588	m104	X	No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
L328306	u1568	m104	JIM	The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
L328305	u1588	m104	X	Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
L328304	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
L328290	u1588	m104	X	I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
L328289	u1568	m104	JIM	I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
L328288	u1588	m104	X	I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
L328287	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
L328286	u1588	m104	X	I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
L328285	u1568	m104	JIM	Yes.
L328284	u1588	m104	X	Jim Garrison?
L327754	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You're so naive, mister.
L327753	u1568	m104	JIM	Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
L327752	u1577	m104	MARTIN	What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
L327751	u1568	m104	JIM	Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
L327750	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
L327749	u1568	m104	JIM	The assassination, Jack?
L327748	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
L327747	u1568	m104	JIM	Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
L327746	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
L327745	u1568	m104	JIM	Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
L327744	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
L327742	u1577	m104	MARTIN	There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
L327741	u1568	m104	JIM	Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
L327737	u1568	m104	JIM	Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
L327736	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
L327735	u1568	m104	JIM	And Oswald?
L327734	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
L327732	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
L327731	u1568	m104	JIM	Where is Banister in all this?
L327728	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
L327727	u1568	m104	JIM	Was he there often?
L327726	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
L327725	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
L327724	u1568	m104	JIM	Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
L327723	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
L327722	u1568	m104	JIM	You have other information?
L327721	u1577	m104	MARTIN	If you buy what you read in the paper.
L327720	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
L327719	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I don't know if I should talk about this.
L327718	u1568	m104	JIM	How much more?
L327716	u1568	m104	JIM	Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
L327715	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Never touched me.
L327714	u1568	m104	JIM	And he never hit you before?
L327713	u1577	m104	MARTIN	More than ten years.
L327712	u1568	m104	JIM	Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
L328588	u1568	m104	JIM	It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
L328587	u1581	m104	NUMA	Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
L328586	u1568	m104	JIM	"I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, ""The Old Man and the Sea""?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton."
L328584	u1568	m104	JIM	He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
L328583	u1581	m104	NUMA	Sure sounds like he's winning.
L328442	u1568	m104	JIM	I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
L328441	u1581	m104	NUMA	Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
L328440	u1568	m104	JIM	I just don't want to do it.  What else?
L328439	u1581	m104	NUMA	She's the best damn witness we have!
L328438	u1568	m104	JIM	No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
L328241	u1568	m104	JIM	Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
L328240	u1581	m104	NUMA	Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
L328233	u1568	m104	JIM	You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
L328232	u1581	m104	NUMA	HOLD IT, CHIEF...
L327994	u1568	m104	JIM	Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
L327993	u1581	m104	NUMA	Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
L327793	u1568	m104	JIM	It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
L327792	u1581	m104	NUMA	Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
L328218	u1568	m104	JIM	How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
L328217	u1579	m104	MILLER	Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
L328216	u1568	m104	JIM	And what would I have to do?
L328215	u1579	m104	MILLER	I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
L328214	u1579	m104	MILLER	Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
L328213	u1568	m104	JIM	The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
L328212	u1579	m104	MILLER	I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
L328209	u1568	m104	JIM	That's it.
L328208	u1579	m104	MILLER	That's all you've had all this time?
L328207	u1568	m104	JIM	Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
L328206	u1579	m104	MILLER	How many men are working with you on this?
L328205	u1568	m104	JIM	If you must know, virtually nothing.
L328204	u1579	m104	MILLER	I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
L328203	u1568	m104	JIM	I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
L328202	u1579	m104	MILLER	You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
L328201	u1568	m104	JIM	Germany.
L328200	u1579	m104	MILLER	Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
L328199	u1579	m104	MILLER	Splendid, love to see them.
L328198	u1568	m104	JIM	They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
L328197	u1568	m104	JIM	We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
L328196	u1579	m104	MILLER	I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
L328195	u1568	m104	JIM	Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
L328194	u1579	m104	MILLER	I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
L328193	u1579	m104	MILLER	Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
L328192	u1568	m104	JIM	Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
L328515	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Uh huh.
L328514	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Do you walk home?
L328513	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Yes.
L328512	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	And you get of from school at 3 every day?
L328510	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	And how tall are you?
L328509	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Six.
L328508	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
L328507	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	That sounds fun.
L328506	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
L328505	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Virginia.
L328504	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Virginia or Elizabeth?
L328503	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Yes?
L328502	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
L327860	u1584	m104	RUBY	Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
L327859	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
L327858	u1584	m104	RUBY	But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
L327857	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
L327856	u1584	m104	RUBY	What are they?
L327855	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
L327854	u1584	m104	RUBY	Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
L327853	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
L327852	u1584	m104	RUBY	When are you going back to Washington, sir?
L327851	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
L327850	u1584	m104	RUBY	Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
L315944	u1612	m106	JACOB	No! Oh God.
L315943	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	Dream on!
L315931	u1612	m106	JACOB	No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
L315930	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	It's all been a dream.
L315929	u1612	m106	JACOB	No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
L315928	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	Remember?
L315927	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
L315926	u1612	m106	JACOB	Let me out of here!
L315925	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	What isn't happening?
L315924	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
L315923	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	Then what are you doing here?
L315922	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm alive.
L315921	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	What are you then?
L315920	u1612	m106	JACOB	Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
L315919	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
L315918	u1612	m106	JACOB	Take me home.
L315917	u1602	m106	DOCTOR	Where do you want to go?
L315916	u1612	m106	JACOB	Get me out of here.
L315545	u1612	m106	JACOB	Like Della.
L315544	u1603	m106	DELLA	Well, how do I look?
L315543	u1612	m106	JACOB	Just to see you. That's all.
L315542	u1603	m106	DELLA	What do you want?
L315541	u1612	m106	JACOB	I see.
L315540	u1603	m106	DELLA	You want to see me? Well, here I am.
L315539	u1612	m106	JACOB	Della?
L315538	u1603	m106	DELLA	Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
L315505	u1603	m106	DELLA	It's fun.
L315504	u1612	m106	JACOB	No, thanks.
L315503	u1603	m106	DELLA	Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
L316155	u1612	m106	JACOB	No, don't. But thanks.
L316154	u1604	m106	DOORMAN	Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
L316153	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm okay.
L316152	u1604	m106	DOORMAN	Are you all right?
L316151	u1612	m106	JACOB	Hello, Sam.
L316150	u1604	m106	DOORMAN	Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
L315799	u1613	m106	JERRY	Me, too.
L315798	u1605	m106	DOUG	Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
L315777	u1605	m106	DOUG	You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
L315776	u1613	m106	JERRY	Grass never did that to me.
L315773	u1605	m106	DOUG	Yeah, ever since that ...
L315772	u1613	m106	JERRY	Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
L315750	u1605	m106	DOUG	Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
L315749	u1613	m106	JERRY	How do you know?
L315748	u1605	m106	DOUG	By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
L316336	u1606	m106	ELI	LET GO!
L316335	u1612	m106	JACOB	What do you want from me?
L316334	u1606	m106	ELI	Daddy. Let go.
L316333	u1612	m106	JACOB	Stop!!!!
L316332	u1606	m106	ELI	You're hurting me!
L316331	u1612	m106	JACOB	Oh God!
L316330	u1606	m106	ELI	Daddy!
L315514	u1612	m106	JACOB	Just my luck.
L315513	u1607	m106	ELSA	It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
L315512	u1612	m106	JACOB	Oh, terrific.
L315511	u1607	m106	ELSA	Short? It's ended.
L315510	u1612	m106	JACOB	It's short, huh?
L315509	u1607	m106	ELSA	You know, you got a strange line here.
L315508	u1607	m106	ELSA	You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
L315507	u1612	m106	JACOB	I could have told you that.
L315506	u1607	m106	ELSA	You have an unusual hand.
L315861	u1608	m106	FRANK	Don't bother to call again, okay?
L315860	u1612	m106	JACOB	Hey, wait!
L315859	u1608	m106	FRANK	I'm hanging up.
L315858	u1612	m106	JACOB	What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
L315857	u1608	m106	FRANK	Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
L315856	u1612	m106	JACOB	Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
L315855	u1608	m106	FRANK	Maybe the demons are real.
L315854	u1612	m106	JACOB	What are you talking about?
L315853	u1608	m106	FRANK	Maybe there's a larger truth.
L315852	u1612	m106	JACOB	What do you mean?
L315851	u1608	m106	FRANK	Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
L315850	u1612	m106	JACOB	Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
L315849	u1608	m106	FRANK	They're not interested, Jake.
L315848	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
L315847	u1608	m106	FRANK	There's nothing to expose.
L315846	u1612	m106	JACOB	Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
L315845	u1608	m106	FRANK	I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
L315844	u1612	m106	JACOB	Well, try, huh.
L315843	u1608	m106	FRANK	It's hard to explain.
L315842	u1612	m106	JACOB	What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
L315841	u1608	m106	FRANK	That's right. We did.
L315840	u1612	m106	JACOB	Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
L315839	u1612	m106	JACOB	Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
L315838	u1608	m106	FRANK	Hello.
L315752	u1612	m106	JACOB	He was upset. He thought people were following him.
L315751	u1608	m106	FRANK	What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
L315644	u1612	m106	JACOB	Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
L315643	u1609	m106	GABE	Don't go.
L315642	u1612	m106	JACOB	Now what?
L315641	u1609	m106	GABE	Wait ... Daddy.
L315630	u1609	m106	GABE	Mom, it's ...
L315629	u1612	m106	JACOB	Tell your mother.
L315628	u1609	m106	GABE	It's cold.
L315627	u1612	m106	JACOB	It was the window.
L315626	u1609	m106	GABE	There was a bang.
L315625	u1612	m106	JACOB	Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
L315624	u1609	m106	GABE	Daddy, what was that noise?
L315880	u1610	m106	GEARY	I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
L315879	u1612	m106	JACOB	War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
L315878	u1610	m106	GEARY	It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
L315877	u1612	m106	JACOB	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
L315876	u1610	m106	GEARY	I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
L315875	u1612	m106	JACOB	Used you?
L315874	u1610	m106	GEARY	I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
L315873	u1612	m106	JACOB	Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
L315872	u1610	m106	GEARY	You mind? I'm eating, huh?
L315870	u1612	m106	JACOB	A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
L315869	u1610	m106	GEARY	You need ... a doctor.
L315868	u1612	m106	JACOB	Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
L315866	u1610	m106	GEARY	Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
L315865	u1612	m106	JACOB	Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
L315816	u1610	m106	GEARY	Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
L315815	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm too messed up to teach.
L315814	u1610	m106	GEARY	Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
L315813	u1612	m106	JACOB	I am.
L315812	u1610	m106	GEARY	Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
L315811	u1612	m106	JACOB	Doctor.  Ph.D.
L315805	u1610	m106	GEARY	Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
L315804	u1612	m106	JACOB	Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
L315803	u1610	m106	GEARY	The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
L315802	u1612	m106	JACOB	This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
L315801	u1610	m106	GEARY	I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
L315758	u1611	m106	GEORGE	What else did he say, Jake?
L315757	u1623	m106	ROD	What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
L315747	u1623	m106	ROD	That was set. I'm tellin' you.
L315746	u1611	m106	GEORGE	But the paper ...
L315745	u1623	m106	ROD	Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
L315744	u1611	m106	GEORGE	Why do you say that?
L315743	u1623	m106	ROD	Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
L315788	u1612	m106	JACOB	I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
L315787	u1611	m106	GEORGE	You think they're connected?
L315764	u1611	m106	GEORGE	Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
L315763	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. Not really ...
L315762	u1611	m106	GEORGE	He say what they looked like?
L315761	u1612	m106	JACOB	A couple of weeks, I think.
L315760	u1611	m106	GEORGE	How long had that been going on?
L315759	u1612	m106	JACOB	He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
L315756	u1612	m106	JACOB	He told me he was going to Hell.
L315755	u1611	m106	GEORGE	What do you mean, demons?
L315797	u1623	m106	ROD	I say you should get a shrink.
L315796	u1612	m106	JACOB	We should get ourselves a lawyer.
L315795	u1623	m106	ROD	Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
L315794	u1612	m106	JACOB	Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
L315793	u1623	m106	ROD	Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
L315790	u1612	m106	JACOB	Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
L315789	u1623	m106	ROD	Not me, buddy.
L315784	u1612	m106	JACOB	An explosion, just like Paul's.
L315783	u1623	m106	ROD	Dr. Carlson's dead?
L315780	u1623	m106	ROD	Shit!
L315779	u1612	m106	JACOB	... I've seen them, too.
L315778	u1623	m106	ROD	It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
L315991	u1612	m106	JACOB	Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
L315990	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Jake, you need to rest.
L315989	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm walking, aren't I?
L315988	u1616	m106	LOUIS	What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
L315987	u1612	m106	JACOB	There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
L315986	u1616	m106	LOUIS	What are you doing?
L315984	u1616	m106	LOUIS	You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
L315983	u1612	m106	JACOB	What? By myself?
L315982	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
L315978	u1616	m106	LOUIS	You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
L315977	u1612	m106	JACOB	I've seen it. It's all pain.
L315976	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
L315975	u1612	m106	JACOB	I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
L315974	u1616	m106	LOUIS	From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
L315973	u1612	m106	JACOB	Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
L315972	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
L315442	u1616	m106	LOUIS	I know.
L315441	u1612	m106	JACOB	Louis, you're a life saver.
L315440	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
L315439	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
L315438	u1616	m106	LOUIS	What?
L315437	u1612	m106	JACOB	I had this weird flash just then.
L315436	u1616	m106	LOUIS	I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
L315435	u1612	m106	JACOB	God almighty. What did you do to me?
L315433	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Wiggle your toes.
L315432	u1612	m106	JACOB	I can't relax.
L315431	u1616	m106	LOUIS	If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
L315430	u1612	m106	JACOB	What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
L315429	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
L315428	u1612	m106	JACOB	What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
L315427	u1616	m106	LOUIS	You should go back to her.
L315426	u1612	m106	JACOB	She hates me, Louis.
L315425	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
L315424	u1612	m106	JACOB	Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
L315423	u1616	m106	LOUIS	She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
L315422	u1612	m106	JACOB	I thought you said she didn't say much.
L315421	u1616	m106	LOUIS	She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
L315420	u1612	m106	JACOB	She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
L315419	u1616	m106	LOUIS	She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
L315418	u1612	m106	JACOB	She talk about the boys?
L315417	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
L315416	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
L315415	u1612	m106	JACOB	Sarah.
L315414	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Who?
L315413	u1612	m106	JACOB	I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
L315412	u1616	m106	LOUIS	"Turn on your right side.  How about the other ""right?""  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left."
L315411	u1612	m106	JACOB	What did she have to say?
L315410	u1616	m106	LOUIS	A bit.
L315409	u1612	m106	JACOB	Her knee acting up?
L315408	u1616	m106	LOUIS	I saw Sarah the other day.
L315407	u1612	m106	JACOB	What can I tell you?
L315406	u1616	m106	LOUIS	I know you. How come you're so tense today?
L315405	u1612	m106	JACOB	How do you know?
L315404	u1616	m106	LOUIS	Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
L316235	u1625	m106	STERN	"I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been ""elected"" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing."
L316234	u1612	m106	JACOB	Hell, you think I am?
L316233	u1625	m106	STERN	Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
L316232	u1612	m106	JACOB	But I see them.
L316231	u1625	m106	STERN	Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
L316230	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
L316229	u1625	m106	STERN	Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
L316228	u1612	m106	JACOB	I need your insight, your intuition.
L316227	u1625	m106	STERN	I don't know what to say.
L316226	u1612	m106	JACOB	Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
L316225	u1625	m106	STERN	Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
L316224	u1612	m106	JACOB	Christ, I know how it sounds.
L316223	u1612	m106	JACOB	I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
L316222	u1625	m106	STERN	I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
L316221	u1612	m106	JACOB	Yes.
L316220	u1625	m106	STERN	See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
L316219	u1612	m106	JACOB	No.  I see them.
L316218	u1625	m106	STERN	Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
L316217	u1612	m106	JACOB	I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
L316216	u1625	m106	STERN	Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
L316215	u1612	m106	JACOB	I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
L316214	u1625	m106	STERN	Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
L316213	u1612	m106	JACOB	Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
L316212	u1625	m106	STERN	Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
L316211	u1612	m106	JACOB	Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
L316210	u1625	m106	STERN	Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
L316209	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
L316208	u1625	m106	STERN	Ah!
L316207	u1612	m106	JACOB	I haven't seen her in months.
L316206	u1625	m106	STERN	And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
L316205	u1625	m106	STERN	Likewise.
L316204	u1612	m106	JACOB	It's good to see you.
L316203	u1625	m106	STERN	Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
L316202	u1612	m106	JACOB	The postal service. I'm a mailman.
L316201	u1625	m106	STERN	Are you in the service?
L315483	u1612	m106	JACOB	Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
L315482	u1621	m106	RECEPTIONIST	If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
L315481	u1612	m106	JACOB	That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
L315480	u1621	m106	RECEPTIONIST	You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
L315479	u1612	m106	JACOB	Whataya mean, no record?
L315478	u1621	m106	RECEPTIONIST	I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
L315477	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jacob Singer.
L315476	u1621	m106	RECEPTIONIST	What's your name?
L315475	u1612	m106	JACOB	Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
L315474	u1621	m106	RECEPTIONIST	Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
L315473	u1612	m106	JACOB	Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
L315472	u1621	m106	RECEPTIONIST	Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
L315471	u1612	m106	JACOB	New? He's been here for years.
L315470	u1621	m106	RECEPTIONIST	Carlson? Is he new here?
L315469	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
L315946	u1612	m106	JACOB	Save me!
L315945	u1624	m106	SARAH	Jacob, what can I do?
L315939	u1624	m106	SARAH	No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
L315938	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm not dead. I am not dead.
L315623	u1624	m106	SARAH	I thought you said it was a nightmare?
L315622	u1612	m106	JACOB	She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
L315621	u1624	m106	SARAH	Go to sleep.
L315620	u1612	m106	JACOB	She was good in bed, though.
L315619	u1624	m106	SARAH	Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
L315618	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
L315617	u1624	m106	SARAH	I don't want to know.
L315616	u1612	m106	JACOB	What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
L315615	u1612	m106	JACOB	This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
L315614	u1624	m106	SARAH	It's not healthy with it closed.
L315613	u1612	m106	JACOB	Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
L315612	u1624	m106	SARAH	I'm not cold.
L315611	u1612	m106	JACOB	It's freezing.
L315610	u1624	m106	SARAH	What was that?
L315909	u1612	m106	JACOB	Goddamn it. I want Louis.
L315908	u1622	m106	RESIDENT	I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
L315907	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. Don't move me.
L315906	u1622	m106	RESIDENT	I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
L315901	u1622	m106	RESIDENT	We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
L315900	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
L315899	u1622	m106	RESIDENT	Who did?
L315898	u1612	m106	JACOB	They stole it.
L315894	u1622	m106	RESIDENT	Your back? Did you fall?
L315893	u1612	m106	JACOB	My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
L316327	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You know who I am.
L316326	u1612	m106	JACOB	TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
L316325	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
L316324	u1612	m106	JACOB	WHO ARE YOU?
L316322	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
L316321	u1612	m106	JACOB	Goddamn you!
L316320	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
L316319	u1612	m106	JACOB	Oh God!
L316318	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
L316317	u1612	m106	JACOB	This isn't happening.
L316315	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
L316314	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where have they gone?
L316313	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's over, Jake. It's all over.
L316312	u1612	m106	JACOB	No! What's going on? Where's my family?
L316311	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Sit down!
L316310	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where are they?
L316309	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Sit down, Jake.
L316308	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
L316300	u1612	m106	JACOB	Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
L316299	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Do what? I haven't done a thing.
L316298	u1612	m106	JACOB	Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
L316297	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
L316296	u1612	m106	JACOB	Don't be funny.
L316295	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Where's West? New Jersey?
L316294	u1612	m106	JACOB	West.
L316293	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Oh?  Where you going?
L316292	u1612	m106	JACOB	I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
L316291	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
L316290	u1612	m106	JACOB	Mid-town mostly.
L316289	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
L316288	u1612	m106	JACOB	Then don't bug me.
L316287	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You can have anything you want.
L316286	u1612	m106	JACOB	Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
L316285	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
L316284	u1612	m106	JACOB	Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
L316283	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
L316282	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm tired.
L316281	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Jake, what is it?
L316280	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm not upset.
L316279	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You look upset.
L316278	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
L316277	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
L316272	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
L316271	u1612	m106	JACOB	Well leave then. Go to Hell.
L316270	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
L316269	u1612	m106	JACOB	You know goddamn well what I mean.
L316268	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
L316267	u1612	m106	JACOB	That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
L316266	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You've lived with me for two years.
L316265	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know you.
L316264	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
L316263	u1612	m106	JACOB	Why won't you answer me?
L316256	u1612	m106	JACOB	Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
L316255	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
L316251	u1612	m106	JACOB	With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
L316250	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	So tell me ... am I still an angel?
L316179	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
L316178	u1612	m106	JACOB	TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
L316177	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
L316176	u1612	m106	JACOB	WHO ARE YOU?
L316172	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
L316171	u1612	m106	JACOB	Who are you? What are you doing to me?
L316170	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
L316169	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
L316168	u1612	m106	JACOB	What's going on?
L316167	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
L316166	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where have they gone?
L316165	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's over, Jake. It's all over.
L316164	u1612	m106	JACOB	No! What's going on? Where's my family?
L316163	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Sit down.
L316162	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where are they?
L316161	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Sit down, Jake.
L316160	u1612	m106	JACOB	What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
L316132	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
L316131	u1612	m106	JACOB	I love you when you're angry.
L316130	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
L316129	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
L316128	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Please.
L316127	u1612	m106	JACOB	I promise.
L316126	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Bullshit!
L316125	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
L316124	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I can waitress. I'm good.
L316123	u1612	m106	JACOB	It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
L316122	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
L316121	u1612	m106	JACOB	Stick with me, kid.
L316120	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
L316117	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's so hard to believe.
L316116	u1612	m106	JACOB	I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
L316115	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
L316114	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What's gotten into you?
L316113	u1612	m106	JACOB	Me neither.
L316112	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
L316111	u1612	m106	JACOB	Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
L316110	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Are you out of your mind?
L316109	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
L316108	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
L316033	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	How do you know he's telling the truth?
L316032	u1612	m106	JACOB	I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
L316031	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	How?
L316030	u1612	m106	JACOB	A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
L316029	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Who was that?
L316027	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
L316026	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
L316025	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It might be for me.
L316024	u1612	m106	JACOB	Don't!
L316023	u1612	m106	JACOB	I can do anything I want.
L316022	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
L316021	u1612	m106	JACOB	You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
L316020	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I want to know. You tell me!
L316019	u1612	m106	JACOB	Stay away from me, Jez.
L316018	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
L316017	u1612	m106	JACOB	Let go!
L316016	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Who else were you expecting?
L316015	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jezzie?
L316014	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's just me.
L315837	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
L315836	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't believe this.
L315835	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
L315834	u1612	m106	JACOB	What's he talking about?
L315833	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	He said you didn't have one.
L315832	u1612	m106	JACOB	What? What do you mean?
L315831	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
L315830	u1612	m106	JACOB	Why didn't you call me?
L315829	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	While you were in the shower.
L315828	u1612	m106	JACOB	He did? When?
L315827	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
L315826	u1612	m106	JACOB	In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
L315825	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	How come? The army?
L315824	u1612	m106	JACOB	You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
L315823	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Remember that.
L315822	u1612	m106	JACOB	Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
L315821	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I know.
L315820	u1612	m106	JACOB	I love you, Jez.
L315819	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
L315818	u1612	m106	JACOB	With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
L315817	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	So tell me ... am I still an angel?
L315664	u1612	m106	JACOB	You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
L315663	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
L315660	u1612	m106	JACOB	What?
L315659	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
L315658	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
L315657	u1612	m106	JACOB	Are we in Brooklyn?
L315656	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	"You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' ""Sarah, close the window,"" over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?"
L315655	u1612	m106	JACOB	Am I home?
L315654	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
L315596	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Here. I'll do it.
L315595	u1612	m106	JACOB	Help me! Help me!
L315585	u1612	m106	JACOB	Hey, I'm not dressed.
L315584	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Sam, Tony, come in here.
L315583	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
L315582	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Lie down!
L315581	u1612	m106	JACOB	Don't gimme that.
L315580	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What kind of man are you?
L315579	u1612	m106	JACOB	I can't do it.
L315577	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
L315576	u1612	m106	JACOB	Look at me. I'm ice cold.
L315575	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	That's your decision.
L315574	u1612	m106	JACOB	You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
L315573	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
L315572	u1612	m106	JACOB	Coming here?
L315571	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	He's coming right over.
L315570	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
L315569	u1612	m106	JACOB	What'd the doctor say?
L315568	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Get your clothes off!
L315567	u1612	m106	JACOB	What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
L315566	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Get your clothes off.
L315565	u1612	m106	JACOB	What the hell are you doin'?
L315564	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	The numbers stop at 107.
L315563	u1612	m106	JACOB	How high is that?
L315562	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's gone to the top.
L315561	u1612	m106	JACOB	What does it say?
L315560	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
L315559	u1612	m106	JACOB	What's it say? A hundred and two?
L315550	u1612	m106	JACOB	If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
L315549	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Can't you stop it?
L315537	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Hey, I'm here.
L315536	u1612	m106	JACOB	Show me Della!
L315535	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Why? What for?
L315534	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where's Della? Bring her here?
L315533	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What do you mean? Where do you think?
L315532	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where?
L315531	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	We're at Della's.
L315530	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where are we?
L315529	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Oh, come on. It's early.
L315528	u1612	m106	JACOB	I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
L315527	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You okay?
L315461	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Come on. What were they, Jake?
L315460	u1612	m106	JACOB	They weren't human!
L315459	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
L315458	u1612	m106	JACOB	Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
L315457	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
L315456	u1612	m106	JACOB	They're like demons, Jez.
L315455	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
L315454	u1612	m106	JACOB	What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
L315453	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
L315451	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
L315450	u1612	m106	JACOB	When was the last time I said a word?
L315449	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	'Cause she's always on your mind.
L315448	u1612	m106	JACOB	Why do you bring her up?
L315447	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
L315402	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I enjoy crushing into you.
L315401	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
L315400	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
L315399	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
L315398	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
L315397	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What's wrong?
L315396	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm going home.
L315395	u1612	m106	JACOB	How's it going?
L315394	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Jake!
L315374	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
L315373	u1612	m106	JACOB	Ready?
L315370	u1612	m106	JACOB	I just want to look ...
L315369	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I don't like things that make you cry.
L315368	u1612	m106	JACOB	Wait. Don't.
L315366	u1612	m106	JACOB	Gabe.
L315365	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Is that the one who died?
L315363	u1612	m106	JACOB	Well, you didn't marry her.
L315362	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Not to me.
L315361	u1612	m106	JACOB	She looked good then.
L315360	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Look at her face. A real bitch.
L315359	u1612	m106	JACOB	What do you mean you can see?
L315358	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Why you left.
L315357	u1612	m106	JACOB	What?
L315356	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
L315355	u1612	m106	JACOB	Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
L315354	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Lemme see.
L315353	u1612	m106	JACOB	Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
L315352	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	"Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so ""what's his name"" brought 'em over on his way to school."
L315351	u1612	m106	JACOB	What's in here?
L315350	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Jake, you are never out of your head!
L315349	u1612	m106	JACOB	I must have been out of my head.
L315348	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	The best.
L315347	u1612	m106	JACOB	And look what I got.
L315346	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	A good lay.
L315345	u1612	m106	JACOB	Yeah, but for what?
L315344	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
L315343	u1612	m106	JACOB	You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
L315342	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I don't let anybody call me that.
L315341	u1612	m106	JACOB	And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
L315340	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Well, personally, I never went for church names.
L315339	u1612	m106	JACOB	They're Biblical. They were prophets.
L315338	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	They're weird names.
L315337	u1612	m106	JACOB	Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
L315336	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	No. The little one.
L315335	u1612	m106	JACOB	Who? Jed?
L315334	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Your kid dropped it off.
L315333	u1612	m106	JACOB	Thanks.  What's that?
L315332	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
L315331	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jezzie, I can't see.
L315330	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Did you look around the headboard?
L315329	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know.
L315328	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Where'd you leave 'em?
L315327	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. Have you seen my glasses?
L315326	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	You up?
L315324	u1612	m106	JACOB	Don't ask.
L315323	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What happened to you?
L315322	u1612	m106	JACOB	Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
L315321	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
L315320	u1612	m106	JACOB	Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
L315319	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	The room!
L315318	u1612	m106	JACOB	What do you mean?
L315317	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	What do you think?
L315316	u1612	m106	JACOB	Thanks.
L315315	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	That help?
L315314	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where to?
L315313	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	I moved the couch. That's all.
L315312	u1612	m106	JACOB	If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
L315311	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Where are you?
L315310	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where is the lamp?
L315309	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Gee, thanks a lot.
L315308	u1612	m106	JACOB	I didn't want to wake you.
L315307	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Why didn't you turn on the light?
L315306	u1612	m106	JACOB	What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
L315305	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Jake, is that you?
L316107	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
L316106	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know what to say.
L316105	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
L316104	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. I couldn't.
L316103	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
L316101	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
L316100	u1612	m106	JACOB	I would have stayed there if I could.
L316099	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
L316098	u1612	m106	JACOB	Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
L316097	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Well that's good to know.
L316096	u1612	m106	JACOB	It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
L316095	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
L316094	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
L316093	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
L316087	u1612	m106	JACOB	What's happening? Help me.
L316086	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Just relax.
L316085	u1612	m106	JACOB	I can't move.
L316084	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Pleasant dreams.
L316083	u1612	m106	JACOB	I think I'm falling asleep.
L316082	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	It's strong stuff.
L316081	u1612	m106	JACOB	One drop?
L316080	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil, but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
L316079	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know.
L316078	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
L316077	u1612	m106	JACOB	What is it?
L316076	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
L316075	u1612	m106	JACOB	Never?
L316074	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
L316073	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
L316072	u1612	m106	JACOB	How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
L316071	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Sometimes. When it's convenient.
L316070	u1612	m106	JACOB	You come here often?
L316069	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
L316068	u1612	m106	JACOB	So why tell me now?
L316067	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
L316066	u1612	m106	JACOB	If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
L316065	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
L316061	u1612	m106	JACOB	Who then?
L316060	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Yeah. But not with the Cong.
L316059	u1612	m106	JACOB	But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
L316058	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
L316057	u1612	m106	JACOB	None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
L316055	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
L316054	u1612	m106	JACOB	Like it was yesterday.
L316053	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
L316051	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
L316050	u1612	m106	JACOB	The Ladder?
L316049	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
L316048	u1612	m106	JACOB	Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
L316047	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
L316046	u1612	m106	JACOB	Shows how much you knew.
L316045	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
L316044	u1612	m106	JACOB	Long time ago.
L316043	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
L316041	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
L316040	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
L316039	u1617	m106	MICHAEL	Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
L315386	u1627	m106	WOMAN	If you're lucky.
L315385	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
L315384	u1627	m106	WOMAN	Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
L315383	u1612	m106	JACOB	You got a nice tan, though.
L315382	u1627	m106	WOMAN	Hot. Where do I sign?
L315381	u1612	m106	JACOB	How was Palm Springs?
L315380	u1627	m106	WOMAN	That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
L315379	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where's Wong?
L315378	u1627	m106	WOMAN	I know. That's why I'm asking.
L315377	u1612	m106	JACOB	They're awfully heavy.
L315376	u1627	m106	WOMAN	How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
L315298	u1612	m106	JACOB	Yeah, you and everyone else.
L315297	u1627	m106	WOMAN	I no from around here.
L315296	u1612	m106	JACOB	Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
L316241	u1612	m106	JACOB	Help me!
L316240	u1626	m106	VOICE	Push 'em back.
L316239	u1626	m106	VOICE	That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
L316238	u1626	m106	VOICE	He'll never make it.
L316237	u1626	m106	VOICE	Total delirium.
L316236	u1626	m106	VOICE	He's burning up.
L316139	u1612	m106	JACOB	What?!
L316138	u1626	m106	VOICE	Dream on!
L316009	u1612	m106	JACOB	What is wrong with you?
L316008	u1626	m106	VOICE	Clear the area. This is an order!
L316001	u1626	m106	VOICE	We're not going to hurt you.
L316000	u1612	m106	JACOB	You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
L315999	u1626	m106	VOICE	Please come quietly.
L315998	u1612	m106	JACOB	For what? For seeking the truth?
L315997	u1626	m106	VOICE	Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
L315523	u1612	m106	JACOB	Help me!
L315522	u1626	m106	VOICE	Push 'em back.
L315521	u1626	m106	VOICE	That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
L315520	u1626	m106	VOICE	Total delirium.
L315519	u1626	m106	VOICE	He's burning up.
L315958	u1619	m106	NURSE	Of course it is. What else could it be?
L315957	u1612	m106	JACOB	This is not a dream! This is my life.
L315956	u1612	m106	JACOB	Last night! They were as real as you are!
L315955	u1619	m106	NURSE	I'm sorry.
L315954	u1612	m106	JACOB	That's a lie. My family was here.
L315953	u1619	m106	NURSE	No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
L315952	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
L315951	u1619	m106	NURSE	You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
L315950	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm awake?
L315949	u1619	m106	NURSE	Lennox Hospital.
L315948	u1612	m106	JACOB	Where am I?
L315947	u1619	m106	NURSE	Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
L315905	u1612	m106	JACOB	Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
L315904	u1619	m106	NURSE	We're doing everything we can.
L315903	u1612	m106	JACOB	Call my chiropractor.
L315902	u1619	m106	NURSE	I'll page him.
L315732	u1612	m106	JACOB	Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
L315731	u1620	m106	PAUL	What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
L315730	u1612	m106	JACOB	You come home with me.
L315729	u1620	m106	PAUL	I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
L315728	u1620	m106	PAUL	They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
L315727	u1612	m106	JACOB	I don't know. I don't know.
L315726	u1620	m106	PAUL	She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
L315725	u1612	m106	JACOB	The army?
L315724	u1620	m106	PAUL	They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
L315723	u1612	m106	JACOB	What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
L315722	u1620	m106	PAUL	Oh God. I know. I know.
L315721	u1612	m106	JACOB	Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
L315720	u1620	m106	PAUL	God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
L315719	u1612	m106	JACOB	Everywhere, like a plague.
L315718	u1620	m106	PAUL	You've seen them?
L315717	u1612	m106	JACOB	I've seen them too ... the demons!
L315716	u1620	m106	PAUL	What do you mean?
L315715	u1612	m106	JACOB	Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
L315714	u1620	m106	PAUL	I don't know what to do.
L315713	u1612	m106	JACOB	It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
L315711	u1620	m106	PAUL	They're waitin' for me, that's why.
L315710	u1612	m106	JACOB	Why not?
L315709	u1620	m106	PAUL	I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
L315708	u1612	m106	JACOB	Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
L315707	u1620	m106	PAUL	Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
L315706	u1620	m106	PAUL	They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
L315705	u1612	m106	JACOB	Who is?
L315704	u1620	m106	PAUL	That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
L315701	u1620	m106	PAUL	Yeah.
L315700	u1612	m106	JACOB	You in trouble?
L315699	u1620	m106	PAUL	I don't know.
L315698	u1612	m106	JACOB	What's goin' on Paul?
L315697	u1620	m106	PAUL	Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
L315696	u1612	m106	JACOB	That black car?
L315695	u1620	m106	PAUL	Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
L315694	u1612	m106	JACOB	What's wrong?
L315693	u1620	m106	PAUL	I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
L315692	u1612	m106	JACOB	You can't talk in Brownsville?
L315691	u1620	m106	PAUL	I just need to talk.
L315690	u1612	m106	JACOB	Why the hell we drivin' here?
L315689	u1620	m106	PAUL	You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
L315688	u1612	m106	JACOB	Nope.
L315687	u1620	m106	PAUL	Still married, Jake?
L315686	u1620	m106	PAUL	You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
L315685	u1612	m106	JACOB	It's not worth it. You'll never win.
L315684	u1620	m106	PAUL	No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
L315683	u1612	m106	JACOB	It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
L315682	u1620	m106	PAUL	Count 'em on one hand.
L315681	u1612	m106	JACOB	You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
L315680	u1620	m106	PAUL	I work in a bakery.
L315679	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
L315678	u1620	m106	PAUL	I need to see you.
L315677	u1612	m106	JACOB	Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
L315676	u1620	m106	PAUL	I need to see you, Jake.
L315675	u1612	m106	JACOB	Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
L315674	u1620	m106	PAUL	Nothin' much.
L315673	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
L315672	u1620	m106	PAUL	A long time.
L315671	u1612	m106	JACOB	Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
L315670	u1612	m106	JACOB	Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
L315669	u1620	m106	PAUL	Paul Gruneger!
L315668	u1612	m106	JACOB	Speaking.
L315667	u1620	m106	PAUL	Jacob Singer?
L315666	u1612	m106	JACOB	Hello.
L315497	u1612	m106	JACOB	No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
L315496	u1615	m106	LEADER	Do you want me to get someone?
L315495	u1612	m106	JACOB	Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
L315494	u1615	m106	LEADER	No one knows. They say it blew up.
L315493	u1612	m106	JACOB	How did it happen?
L315492	u1615	m106	LEADER	Last month, before Thanksgiving.
L315491	u1612	m106	JACOB	Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
L315490	u1615	m106	LEADER	A car accident.
L315489	u1612	m106	JACOB	Died?
L315488	u1615	m106	LEADER	I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
L315487	u1612	m106	JACOB	I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
L315486	u1615	m106	LEADER	Can I help you?
L315607	u1618	m106	MRS. CARMICHAEL	Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
L315606	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
L315605	u1618	m106	MRS. CARMICHAEL	On top of him?
L315604	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Pour it in.
L315603	u1618	m106	MRS. CARMICHAEL	I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
L315602	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	He doesn't like it.
L315601	u1618	m106	MRS. CARMICHAEL	Is he all right?
L315600	u1614	m106	JEZZIE	Bring it in.
L315599	u1618	m106	MRS. CARMICHAEL	I have some ice from the machine.
L337196	u1698	m112	ANDY	Sit down!
L337195	u1708	m112	PETER	The message!  I figured out--
L337156	u1708	m112	PETER	What?
L337155	u1698	m112	ANDY	You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
L337060	u1708	m112	PETER	Get off me!
L337059	u1698	m112	ANDY	Yes you are.
L337057	u1698	m112	ANDY	It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
L337056	u1708	m112	PETER	Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
L337055	u1698	m112	ANDY	You're a lying bastard!
L337054	u1708	m112	PETER	I'm positive.
L337053	u1698	m112	ANDY	You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
L337052	u1708	m112	PETER	I was at the beach.
L337051	u1698	m112	ANDY	We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
L336973	u1698	m112	ANDY	Homesearchers.
L336972	u1708	m112	PETER	Then let's narrow it down.
L336929	u1708	m112	PETER	If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
L336928	u1698	m112	ANDY	Then what's he talking about?
L336927	u1708	m112	PETER	He's not talking about himself.
L336920	u1698	m112	ANDY	There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
L336919	u1708	m112	PETER	No, I need the original note.
L336918	u1698	m112	ANDY	You got it on the board.
L336834	u1698	m112	ANDY	Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
L336833	u1708	m112	PETER	What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
L336832	u1698	m112	ANDY	I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
L336831	u1708	m112	PETER	No.
L336830	u1698	m112	ANDY	You ever do any hunting, Peter?
L336829	u1708	m112	PETER	What do you want?
L336828	u1698	m112	ANDY	Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
L336827	u1708	m112	PETER	No it wasn't.
L336826	u1698	m112	ANDY	The door was open.
L336825	u1708	m112	PETER	How'd you get in here?
L336824	u1698	m112	ANDY	That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
L336823	u1708	m112	PETER	I wouldn't know.
L336822	u1698	m112	ANDY	You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
L336745	u1708	m112	PETER	You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
L336744	u1698	m112	ANDY	You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
L336743	u1708	m112	PETER	Maybe you should.
L336742	u1698	m112	ANDY	We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
L336739	u1708	m112	PETER	You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
L336738	u1698	m112	ANDY	What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
L336728	u1708	m112	PETER	Let's see how much he wants to play.
L336727	u1698	m112	ANDY	Are you crazy?
L336617	u1708	m112	PETER	"Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. ""Her God has gone and left his home."""
L336616	u1698	m112	ANDY	What?
L336615	u1708	m112	PETER	Morpheus.
L336603	u1708	m112	PETER	His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
L336602	u1698	m112	ANDY	All you gotta do is look at the map.
L336601	u1708	m112	PETER	He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
L336600	u1698	m112	ANDY	What do you mean, no?
L336599	u1708	m112	PETER	No.
L336598	u1698	m112	ANDY	Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
L336436	u1698	m112	ANDY	Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
L336435	u1708	m112	PETER	He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
L336434	u1698	m112	ANDY	You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
L336433	u1708	m112	PETER	That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
L336432	u1698	m112	ANDY	It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
L336431	u1708	m112	PETER	What's that supposed to mean?
L336427	u1708	m112	PETER	Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
L336426	u1698	m112	ANDY	You are!  I don't like you.
L336425	u1708	m112	PETER	It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
L336424	u1698	m112	ANDY	Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
L336423	u1708	m112	PETER	Casual.
L336383	u1708	m112	PETER	What are you saying?
L336382	u1698	m112	ANDY	I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
L336381	u1708	m112	PETER	What kind of problem?
L336380	u1698	m112	ANDY	We seem to have a little problem here?
L336373	u1708	m112	PETER	Yes.
L336372	u1698	m112	ANDY	By yourself?
L336367	u1708	m112	PETER	Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
L336366	u1698	m112	ANDY	I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
L336980	u1709	m112	WOMAN	What's the first street?
L336979	u1698	m112	ANDY	I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
L336978	u1709	m112	WOMAN	What are you talking about?
L336977	u1698	m112	ANDY	You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
L336976	u1709	m112	WOMAN	It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
L336975	u1698	m112	ANDY	I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
L336974	u1709	m112	WOMAN	You want me to what?
L337179	u1703	m112	FRANK	I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
L337178	u1698	m112	ANDY	Ready for round two?
L337137	u1703	m112	FRANK	It's a voice modulator.
L337136	u1698	m112	ANDY	What is it?
L337008	u1703	m112	FRANK	Find him!  I want to talk to him.
L337007	u1698	m112	ANDY	I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
L337006	u1703	m112	FRANK	Sanderson?
L337005	u1698	m112	ANDY	I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
L337004	u1703	m112	FRANK	I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
L337003	u1698	m112	ANDY	You alright?
L337002	u1703	m112	FRANK	She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
L337001	u1698	m112	ANDY	How is she?
L336613	u1703	m112	FRANK	Maybe he's going to drug her?
L336612	u1698	m112	ANDY	We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
L336576	u1698	m112	ANDY	Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
L336575	u1703	m112	FRANK	You still having a problem with this?
L336561	u1703	m112	FRANK	Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
L336560	u1698	m112	ANDY	The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
L336550	u1703	m112	FRANK	Anything?
L336549	u1698	m112	ANDY	Sorry.
L336444	u1703	m112	FRANK	Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
L336443	u1698	m112	ANDY	No shit!
L336430	u1698	m112	ANDY	I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
L336429	u1703	m112	FRANK	Take it easy.  Both of you.
L336422	u1703	m112	FRANK	What was your relationship with her?
L336421	u1698	m112	ANDY	We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
L336388	u1703	m112	FRANK	I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
L336387	u1698	m112	ANDY	You think he's dirty?
L336386	u1703	m112	FRANK	He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
L336385	u1698	m112	ANDY	What do you think?
L336329	u1698	m112	ANDY	No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
L336328	u1703	m112	FRANK	Local?
L336327	u1698	m112	ANDY	Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
L336326	u1703	m112	FRANK	Run it down.
L336325	u1698	m112	ANDY	Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
L337093	u1706	m112	KATHY	You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
L337092	u1698	m112	ANDY	We'll find the evidence.
L337080	u1698	m112	ANDY	Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
L337079	u1706	m112	KATHY	It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
L337078	u1698	m112	ANDY	Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
L337077	u1706	m112	KATHY	Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
L337048	u1706	m112	KATHY	He was with me?
L337047	u1698	m112	ANDY	Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
L336926	u1698	m112	ANDY	But a hundred men could move him.
L336925	u1706	m112	KATHY	It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
L336863	u1698	m112	ANDY	What was suspicious about him?
L336862	u1706	m112	KATHY	Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
L336861	u1698	m112	ANDY	Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
L336860	u1706	m112	KATHY	What do you mean, stand out?
L336859	u1698	m112	ANDY	Did anyone stand out?
L336858	u1706	m112	KATHY	A few people.
L336579	u1706	m112	KATHY	Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
L336578	u1698	m112	ANDY	I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
L336577	u1706	m112	KATHY	Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
L336574	u1706	m112	KATHY	He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
L336573	u1698	m112	ANDY	Why does he call Sanderson?
L336556	u1706	m112	KATHY	You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
L336555	u1698	m112	ANDY	You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
L337239	u1708	m112	PETER	You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
L337238	u1699	m112	CALLER	How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
L337235	u1708	m112	PETER	The pipes.
L337234	u1699	m112	CALLER	Very good.  How did you know?
L337233	u1708	m112	PETER	I know where you are.
L337230	u1708	m112	PETER	No!  Wait!!
L337229	u1699	m112	CALLER	I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
L337228	u1699	m112	CALLER	Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
L337227	u1708	m112	PETER	I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
L337226	u1699	m112	CALLER	You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
L337225	u1708	m112	PETER	"That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  ""His play is always fair and just."""
L337224	u1699	m112	CALLER	No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
L337223	u1708	m112	PETER	It's me you want.  Not her.
L337222	u1699	m112	CALLER	The game's over.  You lost.
L337221	u1708	m112	PETER	Please... wait.
L337220	u1699	m112	CALLER	She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
L337219	u1708	m112	PETER	Let me speak to my daughter.
L337218	u1699	m112	CALLER	Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
L337217	u1708	m112	PETER	Yes?
L337176	u1699	m112	CALLER	No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
L337175	u1708	m112	PETER	I've figured out the message.
L337174	u1699	m112	CALLER	By that time the game will be over.
L337173	u1708	m112	PETER	If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
L337172	u1699	m112	CALLER	Emotional?  I expected more from you.
L337171	u1708	m112	PETER	You sonofabitch!
L337170	u1699	m112	CALLER	Hello, Peter.
L337076	u1699	m112	CALLER	--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
L337075	u1708	m112	PETER	I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
L337074	u1699	m112	CALLER	Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
L337073	u1708	m112	PETER	They think that you and I are doing this together.
L337072	u1699	m112	CALLER	The police haven't told you?
L337071	u1708	m112	PETER	What word did you leave last night?
L337070	u1699	m112	CALLER	I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
L337069	u1708	m112	PETER	You're next move should have been e2- e3.
L337068	u1699	m112	CALLER	Very good.
L337067	u1708	m112	PETER	You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
L337066	u1699	m112	CALLER	Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
L337065	u1708	m112	PETER	Hello.
L336909	u1699	m112	CALLER	Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
L336908	u1708	m112	PETER	It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
L336907	u1699	m112	CALLER	The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
L336906	u1708	m112	PETER	I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
L336905	u1699	m112	CALLER	What makes you think I was there?
L336904	u1708	m112	PETER	You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
L336903	u1699	m112	CALLER	What?
L336900	u1708	m112	PETER	You like to brag, don't you?
L336899	u1699	m112	CALLER	I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
L336898	u1708	m112	PETER	If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
L336897	u1699	m112	CALLER	Have you any idea what the message is?
L336737	u1699	m112	CALLER	So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
L336736	u1708	m112	PETER	"Huxley's quote also says, ""his play is always fair and just."""
L336735	u1699	m112	CALLER	I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
L336734	u1708	m112	PETER	How?
L336733	u1699	m112	CALLER	Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
L336732	u1708	m112	PETER	And you want these girls to feel your pain?
L336731	u1699	m112	CALLER	Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
L336730	u1708	m112	PETER	Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
L336729	u1699	m112	CALLER	Just for that no hint today.
L336726	u1708	m112	PETER	Then call them!
L336725	u1699	m112	CALLER	I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
L336723	u1699	m112	CALLER	You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
L336722	u1708	m112	PETER	I'm just trying to play the game.
L336721	u1699	m112	CALLER	I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
L336720	u1708	m112	PETER	Just like who?
L336719	u1699	m112	CALLER	I know what I said!  She looks just like...
L336718	u1708	m112	PETER	But you said you didn't know her.
L336717	u1699	m112	CALLER	Because she's the type.
L336716	u1708	m112	PETER	Why her?
L336715	u1699	m112	CALLER	Not really.
L336714	u1708	m112	PETER	You know her?
L336713	u1699	m112	CALLER	Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
L336712	u1708	m112	PETER	Hello?
L336547	u1699	m112	CALLER	Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet.
L336546	u1708	m112	PETER	You're not going to tell me that.
L336545	u1699	m112	CALLER	I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
L336542	u1708	m112	PETER	If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
L336541	u1699	m112	CALLER	You'll find her.
L336540	u1708	m112	PETER	Where is she?
L336539	u1699	m112	CALLER	I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
L336538	u1708	m112	PETER	What?
L336537	u1699	m112	CALLER	You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
L336536	u1708	m112	PETER	Why not?
L336535	u1699	m112	CALLER	That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
L336534	u1708	m112	PETER	Why did you write remember on the wall?
L336533	u1699	m112	CALLER	We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
L336532	u1708	m112	PETER	And -- what path is that?
L336531	u1699	m112	CALLER	No, only the path she chose to travel.
L336530	u1708	m112	PETER	Did you know her?
L336529	u1699	m112	CALLER	To get your attention.
L336528	u1708	m112	PETER	Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
L336527	u1699	m112	CALLER	Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
L336526	u1708	m112	PETER	Just a second.  Hello?
L336525	u1699	m112	CALLER	Hello, Peter.
L336412	u1708	m112	PETER	I haven't got time for this.
L336411	u1699	m112	CALLER	Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
L336410	u1708	m112	PETER	Who is this?
L336409	u1699	m112	CALLER	Hello, Peter.
L337254	u1706	m112	KATHY	I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
L337253	u1700	m112	DAVID	Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
L337252	u1706	m112	KATHY	I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
L337251	u1700	m112	DAVID	They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
L337250	u1706	m112	KATHY	Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
L337249	u1700	m112	DAVID	You don't understand.
L337248	u1706	m112	KATHY	This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
L337243	u1700	m112	DAVID	The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
L337242	u1708	m112	PETER	What scars?
L337241	u1700	m112	DAVID	You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
L337240	u1708	m112	PETER	Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
L336961	u1700	m112	DAVID	New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
L336960	u1708	m112	PETER	What is it?
L336959	u1708	m112	PETER	He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
L336958	u1700	m112	DAVID	1985.  Hans Korshaud.
L336957	u1708	m112	PETER	Never mind.  He died two years ago.
L336956	u1700	m112	DAVID	There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
L336955	u1708	m112	PETER	Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
L336954	u1700	m112	DAVID	Now what?
L336952	u1700	m112	DAVID	Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
L336951	u1708	m112	PETER	D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
L336948	u1708	m112	PETER	Set up some pieces on the big board?
L336947	u1700	m112	DAVID	Nope.  Nothing.
L336946	u1708	m112	PETER	Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
L336945	u1700	m112	DAVID	No problem.  We're in.
L336944	u1708	m112	PETER	Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
L336943	u1700	m112	DAVID	Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
L336680	u1708	m112	PETER	Of course not.
L336679	u1700	m112	DAVID	Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
L336678	u1708	m112	PETER	What's this?
L336677	u1708	m112	PETER	Thanks.
L336676	u1700	m112	DAVID	Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
L337189	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	You're losing me.
L337188	u1706	m112	KATHY	Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
L337187	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	He was watching you.
L337186	u1706	m112	KATHY	Come here.
L337185	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	Why did he what?
L337184	u1706	m112	KATHY	Why did he?
L337183	u1706	m112	KATHY	He already did once.
L337182	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
L337181	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
L337180	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
L337151	u1706	m112	KATHY	How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
L337150	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
L337149	u1706	m112	KATHY	I just can't believe it.
L337148	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	Feeling better?
L336509	u1706	m112	KATHY	Fuck off!
L336508	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	It worked out alright, didn't it?
L336507	u1706	m112	KATHY	Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
L336506	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
L336505	u1706	m112	KATHY	--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
L336504	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
L336503	u1706	m112	KATHY	You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
L336502	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
L336501	u1706	m112	KATHY	Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
L336500	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
L336499	u1706	m112	KATHY	You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
L336498	u1701	m112	DOCTOR FULTON	You might not have done it had you known.
L336893	u1706	m112	KATHY	Nice meeting you.
L336892	u1702	m112	ERICA	Okay.  Nice meeting you.
L336890	u1702	m112	ERICA	No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
L336889	u1706	m112	KATHY	How do you know that?  Did he say something?
L336888	u1702	m112	ERICA	I know he really likes you.
L336886	u1706	m112	KATHY	Of course.
L336885	u1702	m112	ERICA	Do you like my dad?
L336884	u1702	m112	ERICA	Boys.
L336883	u1706	m112	KATHY	That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
L336882	u1702	m112	ERICA	Not really.  It's pretty boring.
L336881	u1706	m112	KATHY	So, are you having a good time on the Island?
L336880	u1702	m112	ERICA	He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
L336879	u1706	m112	KATHY	Is your dad here?
L336878	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm Kathy.
L336877	u1702	m112	ERICA	Uh huh.
L336876	u1706	m112	KATHY	You must be Erica.
L336849	u1702	m112	ERICA	Who's Kathy?
L336848	u1708	m112	PETER	It isn't Kathy.
L336689	u1702	m112	ERICA	But you promised.
L336688	u1708	m112	PETER	I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
L336687	u1702	m112	ERICA	You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
L336686	u1708	m112	PETER	For what?
L336685	u1702	m112	ERICA	You ready?
L336683	u1702	m112	ERICA	Thanks, David.
L336682	u1708	m112	PETER	Don't you have something you want to say to David?
L336416	u1708	m112	PETER	Nothing.
L336415	u1702	m112	ERICA	What is it, dad?
L336406	u1702	m112	ERICA	No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
L336405	u1708	m112	PETER	Has he gotten through to any?
L336404	u1702	m112	ERICA	Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
L336403	u1708	m112	PETER	Who told you that?
L336318	u1702	m112	ERICA	Okay.
L336317	u1708	m112	PETER	You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
L336316	u1702	m112	ERICA	That has nothing to do with it.
L336315	u1708	m112	PETER	I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
L336314	u1702	m112	ERICA	I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
L336313	u1708	m112	PETER	What are you doing up?
L336304	u1708	m112	PETER	My cheering section.
L336303	u1702	m112	ERICA	Congratulations, dad.
L336670	u1703	m112	FRANK	That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
L336669	u1707	m112	NOLAN	I'd say at least eighteen hours.
L336668	u1703	m112	FRANK	How long she been dead?
L336667	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Yeah.
L336666	u1703	m112	FRANK	Same as the others?
L336659	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
L336658	u1703	m112	FRANK	That's great.
L336657	u1707	m112	NOLAN	This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
L336564	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
L336563	u1703	m112	FRANK	There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
L336562	u1707	m112	NOLAN	He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
L336362	u1707	m112	NOLAN	No Frank.  No prints.
L336361	u1703	m112	FRANK	You mean, no prints but hers?
L336360	u1707	m112	NOLAN	No prints.
L336359	u1703	m112	FRANK	What about prints?
L336358	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
L336357	u1703	m112	FRANK	Anything?
L336342	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Bingo.
L336341	u1703	m112	FRANK	There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
L336337	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
L336336	u1703	m112	FRANK	Any sign of rape?
L336335	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Six, eight hours tops.
L336334	u1703	m112	FRANK	How long has she been dead?
L336333	u1707	m112	NOLAN	Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
L336332	u1703	m112	FRANK	Whaddaya got, Nolan?
L337128	u1703	m112	FRANK	Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
L337127	u1706	m112	KATHY	I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
L337126	u1703	m112	FRANK	I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
L337125	u1706	m112	KATHY	No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
L337124	u1703	m112	FRANK	Did you see his face?
L337091	u1706	m112	KATHY	You don't have a shred of evidence!
L337090	u1703	m112	FRANK	The most logical choice.
L337089	u1706	m112	KATHY	This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
L337088	u1703	m112	FRANK	We're going to work on the message.
L337087	u1706	m112	KATHY	And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
L337084	u1706	m112	KATHY	What does that mean?
L337083	u1703	m112	FRANK	We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
L337082	u1706	m112	KATHY	What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
L337081	u1703	m112	FRANK	He's right, Kathy.
L337050	u1706	m112	KATHY	About a quarter to one.
L337049	u1703	m112	FRANK	What time did he get there?
L336985	u1703	m112	FRANK	Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
L336984	u1706	m112	KATHY	As large as castles.
L336971	u1703	m112	FRANK	That's a big area to cover.
L336970	u1706	m112	KATHY	Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
L336933	u1706	m112	KATHY	He moves around a lot.  Why?
L336932	u1703	m112	FRANK	It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
L336931	u1706	m112	KATHY	I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
L336930	u1703	m112	FRANK	Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
L336748	u1703	m112	FRANK	What did he mean by Huxley?
L336747	u1706	m112	KATHY	Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
L336741	u1706	m112	KATHY	Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
L336740	u1703	m112	FRANK	You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
L336665	u1703	m112	FRANK	This ain't no photo.
L336664	u1706	m112	KATHY	I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
L336663	u1703	m112	FRANK	Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
L336619	u1703	m112	FRANK	Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
L336618	u1706	m112	KATHY	His home would be... Mount Olympus.
L336597	u1706	m112	KATHY	Meaning?
L336596	u1703	m112	FRANK	I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
L336572	u1706	m112	KATHY	I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
L336571	u1703	m112	FRANK	I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
L336570	u1706	m112	KATHY	Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
L336569	u1703	m112	FRANK	Anything else?
L336568	u1706	m112	KATHY	That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
L336567	u1703	m112	FRANK	What about the way he arranged the body?
L336566	u1706	m112	KATHY	Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
L336565	u1703	m112	FRANK	Kathy?
L336559	u1703	m112	FRANK	It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
L336558	u1706	m112	KATHY	But we heard him.
L336557	u1703	m112	FRANK	No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
L336520	u1706	m112	KATHY	--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
L336519	u1703	m112	FRANK	And this Jeremy--
L336518	u1706	m112	KATHY	I see you're still having problems with your openings.
L336512	u1703	m112	FRANK	It's important.
L336511	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm busy right now.
L336496	u1703	m112	FRANK	We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
L336495	u1706	m112	KATHY	What do you think he did?
L336494	u1703	m112	FRANK	We're not sure.
L336493	u1706	m112	KATHY	Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
L336492	u1703	m112	FRANK	What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
L336491	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
L336490	u1703	m112	FRANK	You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
L336489	u1706	m112	KATHY	Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
L336488	u1703	m112	FRANK	Well?
L336869	u1703	m112	FRANK	Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
L336868	u1704	m112	GIRL	Through a rental agency.
L336867	u1703	m112	FRANK	Do you know how she found the apartment?
L336866	u1704	m112	GIRL	Ten days ago.
L336865	u1703	m112	FRANK	Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
L336854	u1704	m112	GIRL	You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
L336853	u1703	m112	FRANK	If you can think of anything else give us a call.
L337210	u1703	m112	FRANK	It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
L337209	u1708	m112	PETER	Did you send the car?
L337206	u1708	m112	PETER	I signed the confession.  What about the car?
L337205	u1703	m112	FRANK	Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
L337202	u1708	m112	PETER	Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
L337201	u1703	m112	FRANK	I understand that this is just another one of your games.
L337200	u1708	m112	PETER	Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
L337154	u1708	m112	PETER	This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
L337153	u1703	m112	FRANK	Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
L337152	u1708	m112	PETER	Jeremy would have never killed himself.
L337046	u1708	m112	PETER	I went out.
L337045	u1703	m112	FRANK	Answer the question.
L337044	u1708	m112	PETER	Are we going to go through this again?
L337043	u1703	m112	FRANK	Where were you last night?
L336990	u1708	m112	PETER	That's got to be it.
L336989	u1703	m112	FRANK	Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
L336988	u1708	m112	PETER	A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
L336987	u1703	m112	FRANK	"He uses castles...plural --  then says ""can't move me.""  Singular.  Not can't move us."
L336986	u1708	m112	PETER	He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
L336983	u1708	m112	PETER	A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
L336982	u1703	m112	FRANK	A building?
L336981	u1708	m112	PETER	As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
L336967	u1708	m112	PETER	But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
L336966	u1703	m112	FRANK	It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
L336950	u1708	m112	PETER	That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
L336949	u1703	m112	FRANK	I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
L336941	u1708	m112	PETER	Maybe I already have.
L336940	u1703	m112	FRANK	How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
L336939	u1708	m112	PETER	He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
L336924	u1703	m112	FRANK	It doesn't make sense.
L336923	u1708	m112	PETER	As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
L336896	u1703	m112	FRANK	Is.  Did you tell him about the institute?
L336895	u1708	m112	PETER	Another one?  What word did he leave?
L336611	u1708	m112	PETER	Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
L336610	u1703	m112	FRANK	We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
L336609	u1708	m112	PETER	That's it?
L336607	u1703	m112	FRANK	Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
L336606	u1708	m112	PETER	Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
L336605	u1703	m112	FRANK	Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street.  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
L336604	u1708	m112	PETER	What have you come up with on the riddle?
L336554	u1703	m112	FRANK	That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
L336553	u1708	m112	PETER	You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
L336517	u1708	m112	PETER	We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
L336516	u1703	m112	FRANK	Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
L336420	u1708	m112	PETER	I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
L336419	u1703	m112	FRANK	Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
L336377	u1708	m112	PETER	I got it from the tournament directory.
L336376	u1703	m112	FRANK	What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
L336375	u1708	m112	PETER	She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
L336374	u1703	m112	FRANK	This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
L336371	u1708	m112	PETER	To my room and then I went for a walk.
L336370	u1703	m112	FRANK	I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
L336369	u1708	m112	PETER	Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
L336368	u1703	m112	FRANK	Could you tell me where you were last night?
L336365	u1708	m112	PETER	Only in passing.  To say hello to.
L336364	u1703	m112	FRANK	I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
L337042	u1708	m112	PETER	Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
L337041	u1705	m112	JEREMY	Feel like practicing?
L337040	u1708	m112	PETER	No.
L337039	u1705	m112	JEREMY	She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
L336844	u1705	m112	JEREMY	Exactly... and you did this.
L336843	u1708	m112	PETER	Mate in five.
L336842	u1705	m112	JEREMY	What do you see here?
L336841	u1708	m112	PETER	Who says something's on my mind.
L336840	u1705	m112	JEREMY	Whatever's on your mind.
L336839	u1708	m112	PETER	About what?
L336838	u1705	m112	JEREMY	Just thought you might want to talk.
L336837	u1708	m112	PETER	You have something you want to say?
L336694	u1708	m112	PETER	I want to be the best I can.
L336693	u1705	m112	JEREMY	You're always in the middle of a match.
L336692	u1708	m112	PETER	I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
L336691	u1705	m112	JEREMY	Peter...
L336675	u1708	m112	PETER	Is it serious?
L336674	u1705	m112	JEREMY	Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
L336673	u1708	m112	PETER	We got a problem?
L336312	u1705	m112	JEREMY	You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
L336311	u1708	m112	PETER	It's a good play, but risky.
L336309	u1708	m112	PETER	I suppose you have something in mind?
L336308	u1705	m112	JEREMY	On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
L336307	u1708	m112	PETER	Then I'll transpose.
L336306	u1705	m112	JEREMY	He knows you're aware of that.
L336305	u1708	m112	PETER	You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
L337166	u1710	m112	WOMAN'S VOICE	"Carefully.  ""Carefully"". ""Carefully""."
L337165	u1706	m112	KATHY	What are they, please?
L337164	u1710	m112	WOMAN'S VOICE	Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
L337163	u1706	m112	KATHY	Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
L337162	u1710	m112	WOMAN'S VOICE	Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
L337161	u1706	m112	KATHY	Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
L337160	u1710	m112	WOMAN'S VOICE	Bainbridge Books.
L337118	u1710	m112	WOMAN'S VOICE	We'll call you back.
L337117	u1706	m112	KATHY	Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
L337116	u1710	m112	WOMAN'S VOICE	I can check and call you back.
L337115	u1706	m112	KATHY	"Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called ""Principals and Tactics"" by Anton Berger."
L337114	u1710	m112	WOMAN'S VOICE	Bainbridge Books.
L337265	u1708	m112	PETER	Do we have a future?
L337264	u1706	m112	KATHY	I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
L337263	u1708	m112	PETER	It's over now.
L337261	u1706	m112	KATHY	There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
L337260	u1708	m112	PETER	I got lucky.
L337259	u1706	m112	KATHY	You beat him.
L337113	u1706	m112	KATHY	Yeah.  I'll be there later.
L337112	u1708	m112	PETER	Are you going to come tonight?
L337111	u1706	m112	KATHY	You're going to be late for your match.
L337110	u1706	m112	KATHY	Of course not.
L337109	u1708	m112	PETER	This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
L337107	u1706	m112	KATHY	He didn't tell you either.
L337106	u1708	m112	PETER	You're right.  The killer told me.
L337105	u1706	m112	KATHY	No he didn't.
L337104	u1708	m112	PETER	Frank told me.
L337103	u1706	m112	KATHY	"How did you know it was ""carefully""?"
L337100	u1708	m112	PETER	It's got to be grammatically correct.
L337099	u1706	m112	KATHY	It could be anything.
L337098	u1708	m112	PETER	If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
L337031	u1706	m112	KATHY	Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
L337030	u1708	m112	PETER	Because I know what it says.
L337029	u1706	m112	KATHY	Why not?
L337028	u1708	m112	PETER	This letter.  I've never opened it.
L337027	u1708	m112	PETER	Because she killed herself!!
L337026	u1706	m112	KATHY	Why?
L337025	u1708	m112	PETER	But I do.
L337024	u1706	m112	KATHY	Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
L337023	u1708	m112	PETER	It's not that easy.
L337022	u1706	m112	KATHY	Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
L337021	u1708	m112	PETER	You don't understand.
L337020	u1706	m112	KATHY	You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
L337019	u1708	m112	PETER	I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
L337018	u1706	m112	KATHY	That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
L337017	u1708	m112	PETER	No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
L337016	u1706	m112	KATHY	Peter...
L337015	u1708	m112	PETER	You really haven't seen my best side.
L337014	u1706	m112	KATHY	I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
L337013	u1708	m112	PETER	I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
L337012	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
L337011	u1708	m112	PETER	The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
L337010	u1708	m112	PETER	Can I come in?
L337009	u1706	m112	KATHY	Hi.
L336965	u1708	m112	PETER	Right.  Here!  c-4.
L336964	u1706	m112	KATHY	Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
L336963	u1708	m112	PETER	He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
L336917	u1708	m112	PETER	Where's the note?
L336916	u1706	m112	KATHY	What?
L336915	u1708	m112	PETER	A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
L336914	u1706	m112	KATHY	But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
L336913	u1708	m112	PETER	Exactly.  It's the key.
L336912	u1706	m112	KATHY	For emphasis?
L336911	u1708	m112	PETER	In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
L336813	u1708	m112	PETER	How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
L336812	u1706	m112	KATHY	Peter...
L336811	u1708	m112	PETER	--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
L336810	u1706	m112	KATHY	Peter, you have to admit--
L336806	u1708	m112	PETER	Then why are you backing up?
L336805	u1706	m112	KATHY	Nothing.
L336804	u1708	m112	PETER	What's wrong?
L336803	u1706	m112	KATHY	I tried again and got through.
L336802	u1708	m112	PETER	I thought you said the line was busy?
L336801	u1706	m112	KATHY	They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
L336799	u1706	m112	KATHY	The line was busy.  I'll try again.
L336798	u1708	m112	PETER	Did you call?
L336797	u1708	m112	PETER	If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
L336796	u1706	m112	KATHY	Would you settle for pepperoni?
L336795	u1708	m112	PETER	You.
L336794	u1706	m112	KATHY	What do you want on it?
L336793	u1708	m112	PETER	Fine.
L336791	u1708	m112	PETER	Call room service.
L336790	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm hungry.
L336789	u1708	m112	PETER	No.
L336788	u1706	m112	KATHY	You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
L336786	u1706	m112	KATHY	I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
L336785	u1708	m112	PETER	I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
L336784	u1706	m112	KATHY	You've got to face the things you feel.
L336783	u1708	m112	PETER	This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
L336782	u1706	m112	KATHY	Then show me who you are.
L336781	u1708	m112	PETER	I just don't want to fight with you.
L336779	u1706	m112	KATHY	Does anyone?
L336778	u1708	m112	PETER	What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
L336777	u1706	m112	KATHY	Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
L336776	u1708	m112	PETER	What?  By attacking me?
L336775	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
L336774	u1708	m112	PETER	What is this?
L336773	u1706	m112	KATHY	Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
L336772	u1708	m112	PETER	I'm not playing a game now.
L336771	u1706	m112	KATHY	Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
L336770	u1708	m112	PETER	What?
L336766	u1706	m112	KATHY	And you?
L336765	u1708	m112	PETER	It was.
L336764	u1706	m112	KATHY	It must've been very hard on Erica?
L336763	u1708	m112	PETER	It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
L336762	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm sorry.
L336761	u1708	m112	PETER	She died in a car accident.
L336760	u1706	m112	KATHY	I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
L336759	u1708	m112	PETER	Alright.  What about me?
L336758	u1706	m112	KATHY	No.  You were talking about chess.
L336757	u1708	m112	PETER	Wasn't I just talking about me?
L336756	u1706	m112	KATHY	You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
L336755	u1708	m112	PETER	You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
L336754	u1706	m112	KATHY	I'm sure you are.
L336753	u1708	m112	PETER	No.  But I'm open to distractions.
L336752	u1706	m112	KATHY	Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
L336707	u1706	m112	KATHY	Because I think he's wrong.
L336706	u1708	m112	PETER	Why?
L336705	u1706	m112	KATHY	No.
L336704	u1708	m112	PETER	Doesn't that scare you?
L336703	u1706	m112	KATHY	You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
L336702	u1708	m112	PETER	I know you didn't
L336700	u1706	m112	KATHY	How could you?  Unless you were there.
L336699	u1708	m112	PETER	I know it was bad.
L336698	u1706	m112	KATHY	How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
L336697	u1708	m112	PETER	Relax.
L336656	u1706	m112	KATHY	No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
L336655	u1708	m112	PETER	You're not?
L336654	u1706	m112	KATHY	No.
L336652	u1706	m112	KATHY	Because I work with them.
L336651	u1708	m112	PETER	Why?
L336650	u1706	m112	KATHY	Of course.
L336649	u1708	m112	PETER	I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
L336648	u1706	m112	KATHY	You have to win every point, don't you?
L336647	u1708	m112	PETER	Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
L336646	u1706	m112	KATHY	You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
L336645	u1708	m112	PETER	Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
L336644	u1706	m112	KATHY	That's not fair!
L336643	u1708	m112	PETER	You mean like in the steam room?
L336642	u1706	m112	KATHY	I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
L336641	u1708	m112	PETER	I'm just curious.
L336639	u1708	m112	PETER	Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
L336638	u1706	m112	KATHY	Let's change the subject.
L336637	u1708	m112	PETER	Do you?
L336636	u1706	m112	KATHY	Of course.
L336635	u1708	m112	PETER	What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
L336634	u1706	m112	KATHY	That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
L336633	u1708	m112	PETER	Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
L336632	u1706	m112	KATHY	How can you look at it so clinically?
L336631	u1708	m112	PETER	Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
L336630	u1706	m112	KATHY	This isn't a game.
L336629	u1708	m112	PETER	In a way.
L336628	u1706	m112	KATHY	Another kind of game?
L336627	u1708	m112	PETER	I think it's interesting.
L336626	u1706	m112	KATHY	Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
L336625	u1708	m112	PETER	It wasn't intentional.
L336624	u1706	m112	KATHY	You sound like my mother.
L336623	u1708	m112	PETER	It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
L336622	u1706	m112	KATHY	I don't think I could.
L336621	u1708	m112	PETER	You sure you don't want to eat something?
L336590	u1706	m112	KATHY	What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
L336589	u1708	m112	PETER	She could be dead now.
L336588	u1706	m112	KATHY	She could be dead after the game.
L336587	u1708	m112	PETER	I can't right now.  I've got a game.
L336586	u1706	m112	KATHY	But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
L336585	u1708	m112	PETER	I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
L336584	u1706	m112	KATHY	We need your help.
L336583	u1708	m112	PETER	Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
L336582	u1706	m112	KATHY	They couldn't break the riddle.
L336486	u1708	m112	PETER	No you didn't.
L336485	u1706	m112	KATHY	Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
L336484	u1708	m112	PETER	What are you looking for?
L336483	u1708	m112	PETER	Getting too hot in here for you?
L336482	u1706	m112	KATHY	Well, I think I've had enough.
L336481	u1706	m112	KATHY	Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
L336480	u1708	m112	PETER	Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
L336479	u1706	m112	KATHY	You.
L336478	u1708	m112	PETER	Are we talking about me, or chess?
L336477	u1706	m112	KATHY	Do you always open quickly?
L336476	u1708	m112	PETER	It is.
L336475	u1706	m112	KATHY	I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
L336474	u1708	m112	PETER	I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
L336473	u1706	m112	KATHY	Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
L336472	u1708	m112	PETER	I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
L336471	u1706	m112	KATHY	That's a very personal question.
L336470	u1708	m112	PETER	If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
L336469	u1706	m112	KATHY	--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
L336468	u1708	m112	PETER	Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
L336467	u1706	m112	KATHY	Sounds very violent.
L336466	u1708	m112	PETER	Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
L336465	u1706	m112	KATHY	It seems like such a complicated game.
L336464	u1708	m112	PETER	When I was very young.
L336463	u1706	m112	KATHY	I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
L336462	u1708	m112	PETER	Yes.
L336461	u1706	m112	KATHY	Are you one of the players?
L336460	u1708	m112	PETER	Uh huh.
L336459	u1706	m112	KATHY	Are you with the tournament?
L336458	u1708	m112	PETER	No.  I don't.
L336457	u1706	m112	KATHY	Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
L336456	u1708	m112	PETER	How come you don't stay with them?
L336455	u1706	m112	KATHY	I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
L336454	u1708	m112	PETER	Yes.
L336453	u1706	m112	KATHY	Is this your first time here?
L336452	u1706	m112	KATHY	It's alright.
L336451	u1708	m112	PETER	Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
L336402	u1711	m112	YURILIVICH	Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
L336401	u1708	m112	PETER	Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
L336400	u1711	m112	YURILIVICH	I'm not nervous.
L336399	u1708	m112	PETER	You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
L336398	u1711	m112	YURILIVICH	No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
L336397	u1708	m112	PETER	I'm sure you are.
L336396	u1711	m112	YURILIVICH	Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
L356223	u1866	m123	V	Sure, I'm okay.
L356222	u1883	m123	PETE	I'm, okay... You okay?
L356221	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah.
L356220	u1866	m123	V	Pete... You okay?
L356219	u1866	m123	V	You okay?... What's wrong?
L356218	u1883	m123	PETE	What?
L356217	u1866	m123	V	You okay, man?
L356083	u1866	m123	V	Pile in.
L356082	u1883	m123	PETE	They're comin' with us.
L356081	u1866	m123	V	What's happenin'?
L356071	u1883	m123	PETE	No, I'm okay.
L356070	u1866	m123	V	You want somethin'?
L356068	u1866	m123	V	You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
L356067	u1883	m123	PETE	Listen.
L356066	u1866	m123	V	Texaco... What's wrong with that?
L356065	u1883	m123	PETE	"This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, ""V""?"
L356057	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.
L356056	u1866	m123	V	Sure, what's wrong with that?
L356055	u1883	m123	PETE	"Sheila'll be at ""Tops""."
L356054	u1866	m123	V	"Just goin' up'ta ""Tops""... Maybe the ""Ten Pin""."
L356050	u1883	m123	PETE	Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
L356049	u1866	m123	V	Good... You up for a drive?
L356048	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't think so.
L356047	u1866	m123	V	You're not contagious are you?
L355812	u1877	m123	FRED	I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
L355811	u1867	m123	AL	Why not?
L355776	u1877	m123	FRED	It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
L355775	u1867	m123	AL	Why not?
L355772	u1877	m123	FRED	How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
L355771	u1867	m123	AL	What do you mean by that?
L355770	u1877	m123	FRED	I like to remember things my own way.
L355764	u1877	m123	FRED	Yes, I thought my wife...
L355763	u1867	m123	AL	You're a musician?
L355760	u1877	m123	FRED	This is our bedroom.
L355759	u1867	m123	AL	Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
L355806	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
L355805	u1867	m123	AL	We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
L355781	u1885	m123	RENEE	No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
L355780	u1867	m123	AL	Maid? Relative?
L355779	u1885	m123	RENEE	No.
L355769	u1885	m123	RENEE	No. Fred hates them.
L355768	u1867	m123	AL	Do you own a video camera?
L355753	u1867	m123	AL	The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
L355752	u1885	m123	RENEE	What is?
L355751	u1867	m123	AL	Very strange.
L356418	u1876	m123	ED	There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
L356417	u1867	m123	AL	What's that, Ed?
L356416	u1876	m123	ED	You know what I think?
L356415	u1867	m123	AL	We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
L356233	u1867	m123	AL	Ours, Ed.
L356232	u1876	m123	ED	His or ours?
L356231	u1867	m123	AL	What a fuckin' job.
L356162	u1867	m123	AL	Yeah... Laurent.
L356161	u1876	m123	ED	You recognize that guy?
L356025	u1876	m123	ED	Yeah.
L356024	u1867	m123	AL	Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
L355801	u1876	m123	ED	Or not so recently?
L355800	u1867	m123	AL	Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
L355797	u1876	m123	ED	Or something.
L355796	u1867	m123	AL	You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
L355785	u1867	m123	AL	If anything else happens, you'll call us.
L355784	u1876	m123	ED	As best we can.
L355783	u1867	m123	AL	We'll keep a watch on the house.
L355778	u1867	m123	AL	Anybody else have a key to the house.
L355777	u1876	m123	ED	Might be a good time to try using it again.
L355757	u1867	m123	AL	Right... This just glided along.
L355756	u1876	m123	ED	Like you'd get if it was hand held.
L355755	u1867	m123	AL	And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
L355754	u1876	m123	ED	How'd the camera get so high like that?
L356395	u1883	m123	PETE	Alice?
L356394	u1868	m123	ALICE	Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
L356389	u1868	m123	ALICE	Up the stairs - down the hall.
L356388	u1883	m123	PETE	Where's the bathroom?
L356384	u1868	m123	ALICE	We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
L356383	u1883	m123	PETE	Alice...
L356381	u1883	m123	PETE	Alice?
L356380	u1868	m123	ALICE	You killed him.
L356379	u1883	m123	PETE	We killed him.
L356378	u1868	m123	ALICE	You all right?
L356375	u1883	m123	PETE	Alice, I...
L356374	u1868	m123	ALICE	You got him.
L356325	u1868	m123	ALICE	Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
L356324	u1883	m123	PETE	Yes.
L356323	u1868	m123	ALICE	Are you my man?
L356321	u1883	m123	PETE	Oh, yeah?... What else?
L356320	u1868	m123	ALICE	I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
L356319	u1883	m123	PETE	What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
L356318	u1868	m123	ALICE	Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
L356317	u1883	m123	PETE	What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
L356316	u1868	m123	ALICE	'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
L356315	u1883	m123	PETE	Why are ya goin' so early?
L356314	u1868	m123	ALICE	Set.
L356312	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.
L356311	u1868	m123	ALICE	Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
L356310	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay...
L356309	u1868	m123	ALICE	I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
L356308	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah. Call him.
L356307	u1868	m123	ALICE	That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
L356306	u1883	m123	PETE	Andy?
L356305	u1868	m123	ALICE	So, should I call Andy?
L356301	u1868	m123	ALICE	If you want me to go away, I'll go away.

L356282	u1883	m123	PETE	Have you partied with him?
L356277	u1868	m123	ALICE	No... no.
L356276	u1883	m123	PETE	We should stop seeing each other.
L356275	u1868	m123	ALICE	I don't know.
L356274	u1883	m123	PETE	So what do we do?
L356273	u1868	m123	ALICE	I'm not positive... but... he knows.
L356272	u1883	m123	PETE	Are you positive he knows?
L356271	u1868	m123	ALICE	He'll kill us.
L356268	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.

L356210	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure.
L356209	u1868	m123	ALICE	I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
L356208	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay...
L356207	u1868	m123	ALICE	I can't see you tonight.

L356181	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah, I remember.
L356180	u1868	m123	ALICE	I was here yesterday.
L355845	u1869	m123	ANDY	Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
L355844	u1877	m123	FRED	I don't. I don't know him.
L355843	u1869	m123	ANDY	He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
L355842	u1877	m123	FRED	But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
L355841	u1869	m123	ANDY	Yes, I believe so.
L355840	u1877	m123	FRED	Dick Laurent?
L355839	u1869	m123	ANDY	I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
L355838	u1877	m123	FRED	Andy, who is that guy?
L356113	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.

L356256	u1871	m123	BILL	No.
L356255	u1883	m123	PETE	Please tell me.
L356254	u1883	m123	PETE	What happened to me?
L356253	u1871	m123	BILL	We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
L356252	u1883	m123	PETE	Did you tell the police this?
L356251	u1871	m123	BILL	Never saw him before in my life.
L356248	u1883	m123	PETE	What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
L356247	u1871	m123	BILL	Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
L356246	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila?
L356243	u1883	m123	PETE	But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
L356242	u1871	m123	BILL	They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
L356241	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah? what did they want?
L356240	u1871	m123	BILL	The police called us.

L356238	u1871	m123	BILL	You don't look so good.

L356236	u1883	m123	PETE	What's up?
L356235	u1871	m123	BILL	Sit down a minute.

L356058	u1883	m123	PETE	Goin' out with these clowns for a while.

L356033	u1871	m123	BILL	"Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a ""fever""."
L356032	u1883	m123	PETE	Better.
L356016	u1888	m123	WARDEN	All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
L356015	u1871	m123	BILL	Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
L356014	u1888	m123	WARDEN	No.
L356013	u1871	m123	BILL	Have you made any charges against him?
L355977	u1871	m123	BILL	Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
L355976	u1888	m123	WARDEN	His physical condition.
L355975	u1871	m123	BILL	His condition? What do you mean?
L355972	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Yes.
L355971	u1871	m123	BILL	The wife killer?
L355970	u1888	m123	WARDEN	A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
L356245	u1871	m123	BILL	You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
L356244	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	We saw you that night, Pete.
L356030	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	No... Here he comes.
L356029	u1871	m123	BILL	You talk to him?
L356028	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Out in back.
L356027	u1871	m123	BILL	Where's Pete?
L356020	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
L356019	u1871	m123	BILL	Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
L356018	u1888	m123	WARDEN	We'll get a tail put on him.
L356017	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	You just gonna let him go?
L355962	u1888	m123	WARDEN	What's the word on the street?
L355961	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	One of the guards must have leaked it.
L355956	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
L355955	u1888	m123	WARDEN	How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
L355942	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
L355941	u1888	m123	WARDEN	If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
L355940	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
L355939	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Did you ask him who he is?
L355938	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	He's in the infirmary, being examined.
L355937	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Where is he now?
L355936	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
L355935	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
L355934	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
L355933	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Repeat that, Bill.
L355932	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
L355931	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Yeah, Mack?
L355930	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
L355929	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Who is it?
L355928	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	No, sir, it's not.
L355927	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	That's not Fred Madison?
L355926	u1879	m123	JOHNNY MACK	I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
L355925	u1872	m123	CAPTAIN HENDERSON	Now, Mack, what's the situation?
L356001	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Pete, what happened to you?
L356000	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
L355998	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
L355997	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	I want to see him.
L355993	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	He didn't come home.
L355992	u1888	m123	WARDEN	What about yesterday?
L355991	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	When he went to work, right.
L355990	u1888	m123	WARDEN	You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
L355989	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	I wouldn't know how.
L356350	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	He won't give his name.
L356349	u1883	m123	PETE	Who is it?
L356250	u1883	m123	PETE	Who was the man?
L356249	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	We know that.
L356216	u1883	m123	PETE	Nothin'.
L356215	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	What's the matter?
L356041	u1883	m123	PETE	No... I don't. Why?
L356040	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Do you remember?
L356022	u1873	m123	CLAIRE	Coming up.
L356021	u1883	m123	PETE	No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
L355952	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
L355951	u1888	m123	WARDEN	A headache?
L355950	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
L355949	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	Not even close.
L355948	u1888	m123	WARDEN	He's not Madison?
L355947	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
L355946	u1888	m123	WARDEN	Who is this man?
L355945	u1874	m123	DR. ROGOFF	I don't know yet.
L355944	u1888	m123	WARDEN	What is this, Rogoff?
L356143	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	"FUCKIN' ""A""."
L356142	u1875	m123	DRIVER	I'll get a manual.  and study it.
L356141	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
L356140	u1875	m123	DRIVER	No.
L356139	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
L356138	u1875	m123	DRIVER	I won't ever tailgate.
L356135	u1875	m123	DRIVER	I... I didn't say anything...
L356134	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	WHAT DID YOU SAY?
L355810	u1877	m123	FRED	The first night... Not the last two.
L355809	u1876	m123	ED	Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
L355767	u1876	m123	ED	Tone deaf.
L355766	u1877	m123	FRED	Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
L355765	u1876	m123	ED	What's your axe?
L355762	u1877	m123	FRED	No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
L355761	u1876	m123	ED	There's no other bedroom?
L355750	u1876	m123	ED	Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
L355749	u1877	m123	FRED	That's it.
L355919	u1877	m123	FRED	But my head...
L355918	u1878	m123	GUARD	The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
L355917	u1877	m123	FRED	Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
L355916	u1878	m123	GUARD	What is it?
L355912	u1878	m123	GUARD	I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
L355911	u1877	m123	FRED	The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
L355910	u1878	m123	GUARD	What's bothering you, Madison?
L355909	u1877	m123	FRED	No, no. I want to go in.
L355908	u1878	m123	GUARD	Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
L355907	u1877	m123	FRED	My... My head.
L355906	u1878	m123	GUARD	Something wrong?
L356409	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	Alice who?
L356408	u1877	m123	FRED	Where's Alice?
L355824	u1877	m123	FRED	That's absurd.
L355823	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	At your house.
L355822	u1877	m123	FRED	What do you mean? You're where right now?
L355821	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
L355820	u1877	m123	FRED	No, no I don't. Are you sure?
L355819	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	At your house. Don't you remember?
L355818	u1877	m123	FRED	I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
L355817	u1882	m123	MYSTERY MAN	We've met before, haven't we?
L355860	u1877	m123	FRED	No... of course not.
L355859	u1885	m123	RENEE	Was there?
L355858	u1877	m123	FRED	I thought there might be somebody inside.
L355857	u1885	m123	RENEE	Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
L355856	u1877	m123	FRED	I told you to stay in the car!
L355854	u1877	m123	FRED	He's got some fucked up friends.
L355853	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
L355852	u1877	m123	FRED	What job?
L355851	u1885	m123	RENEE	It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
L355849	u1877	m123	FRED	Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
L355848	u1885	m123	RENEE	But...
L355847	u1877	m123	FRED	Let's go home.
L355837	u1877	m123	FRED	Just a minute.
L355836	u1885	m123	RENEE	I thought you were getting me a drink?
L355815	u1885	m123	RENEE	But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
L355814	u1877	m123	FRED	I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
L355808	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
L355807	u1877	m123	FRED	Where would you feel safe?
L355799	u1885	m123	RENEE	Why would anyone do something like this?
L355798	u1877	m123	FRED	No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
L355794	u1885	m123	RENEE	On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
L355793	u1877	m123	FRED	What?
L355792	u1885	m123	RENEE	What was that?!!!
L355791	u1877	m123	FRED	I wish I knew.
L355790	u1885	m123	RENEE	What the hell is going on?!
L355787	u1877	m123	FRED	Thanks, guys.
L355786	u1885	m123	RENEE	We will.
L355748	u1885	m123	RENEE	Two detectives are coming out.
L355747	u1877	m123	FRED	So?
L355744	u1877	m123	FRED	All right.
L355743	u1885	m123	RENEE	We've got to call the police.
L355740	u1885	m123	RENEE	I guess so.
L355739	u1877	m123	FRED	Don't you want to watch it?
L355738	u1885	m123	RENEE	Yes, I just found it on the step.
L355737	u1877	m123	FRED	What's that? Another tape?
L355736	u1877	m123	FRED	Who the hell owns that dog?
L355735	u1885	m123	RENEE	That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
L355734	u1877	m123	FRED	You're up early.
L355730	u1877	m123	FRED	You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
L355729	u1885	m123	RENEE	Yeah?
L355728	u1877	m123	FRED	I had a dream about you last night...
L355726	u1877	m123	FRED	You were asleep when I got home, yes.
L355725	u1885	m123	RENEE	I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
L355724	u1877	m123	FRED	From the club. You didn't answer.
L355723	u1885	m123	RENEE	Called? When?
L355722	u1877	m123	FRED	I called, you know.
L355721	u1885	m123	RENEE	Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
L355720	u1877	m123	FRED	When you didn't come to the club.
L355719	u1885	m123	RENEE	What night?
L355718	u1877	m123	FRED	Same one you were reading the other night?
L355717	u1885	m123	RENEE	Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
L355716	u1877	m123	FRED	Good book, huh?
L355715	u1877	m123	FRED	Maybe.
L355714	u1885	m123	RENEE	It must be from a real estate agent.
L355711	u1885	m123	RENEE	No, nothing.
L355710	u1877	m123	FRED	Does it say anything on the tape?
L355709	u1885	m123	RENEE	I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
L355708	u1877	m123	FRED	Who's it from?
L355707	u1885	m123	RENEE	A videotape.
L355706	u1877	m123	FRED	What's that?
L355705	u1885	m123	RENEE	Wake me up when you get home.
L355704	u1877	m123	FRED	That's why I married you.
L355703	u1885	m123	RENEE	I like to laugh, Fred.
L355702	u1877	m123	FRED	It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
L355700	u1885	m123	RENEE	I thought I'd stay home and read.
L355699	u1877	m123	FRED	What are you going to do?
L355698	u1885	m123	RENEE	You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
L355891	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
L355890	u1880	m123	MARIAN	The heart, I guess.
L355889	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
L355888	u1880	m123	MARIAN	Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
L355887	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	Which would you choose?
L355886	u1880	m123	MARIAN	Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
L355885	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	They're gonna cook him.
L355884	u1880	m123	MARIAN	How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
L355883	u1884	m123	RAQUEL	Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
L356363	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
L356362	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah.
L356361	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
L356360	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
L356359	u1883	m123	PETE	Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
L356358	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
L356357	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.
L356356	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
L356355	u1883	m123	PETE	Mr. Eddy?
L356354	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You know who it is.
L356353	u1883	m123	PETE	Who is this?
L356352	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
L356351	u1883	m123	PETE	Hello.
L356263	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
L356262	u1883	m123	PETE	What?
L356261	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
L356260	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
L356259	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay.
L356258	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	How ya doin', Pete?
L356169	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You're my man, Pete.
L356168	u1883	m123	PETE	It'll be ready.
L356167	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
L356166	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
L356165	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
L356160	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You will.
L356159	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
L356158	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Suit yourself, champ.
L356157	u1883	m123	PETE	No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
L356156	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Yeah. Give ya a boner.
L356155	u1883	m123	PETE	Pornos?
L356154	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	You like pornos?
L356153	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	"No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the ""Caddy"" by tomorrow."
L356152	u1883	m123	PETE	Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
L356150	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	What'd I tell ya.
L356149	u1883	m123	PETE	Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
L356148	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	At sixty?
L356147	u1883	m123	PETE	Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
L356146	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
L356145	u1883	m123	PETE	I can see that.
L356144	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
L356130	u1883	m123	PETE	Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
L356129	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
L356128	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	All right!
L356127	u1883	m123	PETE	Give that a try.
L356123	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
L356122	u1883	m123	PETE	Okay... Lemme clear it with...
L356121	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
L356120	u1883	m123	PETE	Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
L356119	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
L356118	u1883	m123	PETE	No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
L356117	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
L356116	u1883	m123	PETE	No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
L356115	u1881	m123	MR. EDDY	What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
L356372	u1887	m123	VOICE	Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
L356371	u1883	m123	PETE	What's goin' on?
L356369	u1883	m123	PETE	What?
L356368	u1887	m123	VOICE	We just killed a couple of people...
L356367	u1883	m123	PETE	No. No, I don't.
L356366	u1887	m123	VOICE	At your house. Don't you remember?
L356365	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
L356341	u1886	m123	SHEILA	FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
L356340	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila... Stop...
L356337	u1883	m123	PETE	Go home, Sheila.
L356336	u1886	m123	SHEILA	YOU'RE SORRY!!
L356335	u1883	m123	PETE	Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
L356334	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What's the BITCH'S name?!
L356333	u1883	m123	PETE	Hey... Sheila.
L356332	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
L356331	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila...
L356330	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
L356329	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
L356229	u1883	m123	PETE	Come on.
L356228	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I didn't know you cared.
L356227	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah.
L356226	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I was?
L356225	u1883	m123	PETE	I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
L356224	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Where'd you come from?
L356176	u1883	m123	PETE	I do like you, Sheila.
L356175	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Why don't you like me?
L356173	u1883	m123	PETE	Come on... get in.
L356172	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I don't know.
L356171	u1883	m123	PETE	Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
L356170	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What do you want?
L356106	u1886	m123	SHEILA	No... I really don't want to talk about it.
L356105	u1883	m123	PETE	Sheila?!
L356104	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I don't want to talk about it...
L356103	u1883	m123	PETE	Whatiya mean, Sheila?
L356102	u1886	m123	SHEILA	It was weird...
L356101	u1883	m123	PETE	No... I told you.
L356100	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You really don't remember?
L356099	u1883	m123	PETE	What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
L356098	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure. Sure I do.
L356097	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You still care about me?
L356094	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You were acting like a different person.
L356093	u1883	m123	PETE	Whatiya mean?
L356092	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
L356091	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't remember... What happened that night?
L356090	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Last time I saw you.
L356089	u1883	m123	PETE	What night?
L356088	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
L356087	u1883	m123	PETE	I don't know.
L356086	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
L356085	u1883	m123	PETE	Sorry... I...
L356084	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Why haven't you called me?
L356080	u1883	m123	PETE	Sure.
L356079	u1886	m123	SHEILA	You want some company?
L356078	u1883	m123	PETE	"Guess we're goin' over to the ""Ten Pin""."
L356077	u1886	m123	SHEILA	What are you guys doin'?
L356074	u1886	m123	SHEILA	Yeah.
L356073	u1883	m123	PETE	Yeah?...
L356072	u1886	m123	SHEILA	I missed you.
L357776	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	"Let me have it.  ""Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."""
L357775	u1892	m124	CLERK	Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
L357774	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
L357773	u1892	m124	CLERK	Yes, sir.
L357772	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
L357771	u1892	m124	CLERK	All of it?
L357768	u1892	m124	CLERK	Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford.
L357767	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	Oh, read it!
L357766	u1892	m124	CLERK	Cable from Gainsford.
L357226	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes.
L357225	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Two years!?
L357218	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
L357217	u1890	m124	BARNARD	What about those men we met this morning?
L357208	u1891	m124	CHANG	It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
L357207	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Not even a radio?
L357201	u1891	m124	CHANG	Thank you.
L357200	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
L357199	u1891	m124	CHANG	She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
L357198	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
L357661	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village?
L357660	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
L357527	u1890	m124	BARNARD	In a quandary.
L357526	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
L357525	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Come on, Lovey.
L357524	u1898	m124	LOVETT	They were in a quandary, and?
L357523	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
L357522	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"?then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, ""Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed."" And then the mama bear said, ""Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" And then the big papa bear, he roared, ""And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!"
L357520	u1898	m124	LOVETT	This doesn't obligate me in any way.
L357519	u1890	m124	BARNARD	There you are!
L357516	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Certainly not!
L357515	u1898	m124	LOVETT	And be poisoned out here in the open?
L357514	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
L357513	u1898	m124	LOVETT	So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
L357512	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
L357506	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Horns? What kind of horns?
L357505	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah. You know.
L357504	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Horns?
L357503	u1890	m124	BARNARD	They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
L357502	u1898	m124	LOVETT	And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
L357501	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, Lovey.
L357500	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
L357499	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Just call me Barney.
L357498	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
L357408	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sounds like a stall to me.
L357407	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.
L357377	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
L357376	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
L357375	u1898	m124	LOVETT	colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people?
L357374	u1890	m124	BARNARD	That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
L357368	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
L357367	u1898	m124	LOVETT	The police?
L357366	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
L357365	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Certainly not.
L357362	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
L357361	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Have I?
L357360	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
L357359	u1890	m124	BARNARD	And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
L357241	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
L357240	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.
L357239	u1890	m124	BARNARD	No kidding?
L357238	u1898	m124	LOVETT	As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
L357237	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
L357236	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm thinking.
L357235	u1890	m124	BARNARD	How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
L357179	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
L357178	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
L357177	u1898	m124	LOVETT	All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
L357176	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
L357174	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Please don't call me Lovey.
L357173	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
L357172	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
L357171	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
L357170	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
L357169	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Something tells me this means food. Come on!
L357168	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
L357167	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
L357166	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Will you stop squawking!
L357165	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
L357143	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Do you think they're cannibals?
L357142	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yes!
L357141	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Where are they? Do you see them?
L357124	u1890	m124	BARNARD	All right, all right. Keep quiet.
L357123	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
L357042	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
L357041	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
L357028	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
L357027	u1890	m124	BARNARD	He might have lost his way.
L357021	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Now you're irritating and absurd!
L357020	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
L357019	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is?  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
L357018	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yes.
L357017	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, really?
L357016	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
L357015	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south?
L357014	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Look here?
L357013	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It certainly is.
L357012	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Is it?
L357011	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's ridiculous.
L357010	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
L357009	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why, of course. Yes.
L357008	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
L357007	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm never conversational before I coffee.
L357006	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
L357005	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I see.
L357004	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I see.
L357003	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
L357000	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Good morning?
L356999	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I say, good morning, Lovey.
L356998	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I beg your pardon.
L356997	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Good morning, Lovey.
L356970	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
L356969	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Don't call me brother.
L356968	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, brother.
L356967	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes, it just shows?  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
L356965	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
L356964	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
L356963	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
L356962	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
L356961	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
L356960	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.
L356959	u1898	m124	LOVETT	This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
L356958	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sorry.
L356957	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Not at all.
L356956	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
L356955	u1898	m124	LOVETT	When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
L356954	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.
L356953	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Found in Asia!
L356952	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, what do you know about that!
L356951	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
L356950	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, I see.
L356949	u1898	m124	LOVETT	A paleontologist.
L356948	u1890	m124	BARNARD	A what?
L356947	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm a paleontologist.
L356946	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Fossils, huh?
L356945	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Fossils.
L356944	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
L357590	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right.
L357589	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
L357588	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Gold. You were going to?
L357587	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Huh?
L357586	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Say, what about that gold deal?
L357585	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Think of it! In times like these.
L357584	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's unbelievable.
L357583	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
L357404	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
L357403	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
L357370	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
L357369	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Chalmers Bryant!
L357364	u1890	m124	BARNARD	All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
L357363	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
L357351	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
L357350	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
L357234	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
L357233	u1890	m124	BARNARD	That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
L357181	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I'll say.
L357180	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
L357115	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
L357114	u1890	m124	BARNARD	What are we going to do?
L357040	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
L357039	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, that's that, I guess.
L357038	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
L357037	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Charming chap.
L357645	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
L357644	u1895	m124	GLORIA	If you want me to!
L357631	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
L357630	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
L357629	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
L357356	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Why, you look beautiful.
L357355	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Nothing. Why?
L357354	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey, what's happened to you?
L356975	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
L356974	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Say, you're an American, aren't you?
L356973	u1895	m124	GLORIA	No.
L356972	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I say, will you have a cigarette?
L357643	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
L357642	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
L357641	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business?
L357640	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
L357639	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well - I'm?
L357638	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You mean you don't want to go?
L357637	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
L357636	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
L357635	u1890	m124	BARNARD	When are you going to start?
L357634	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
L357633	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Leaving?
L357632	u1894	m124	GEORGE	There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
L357140	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Look, Bob!
L357139	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey - look!
L357138	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Over by that hill.
L357137	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Cave, eh? Where?
L357619	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
L357618	u1891	m124	CHANG	You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
L357613	u1891	m124	CHANG	Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
L357612	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
L357611	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
L357610	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
L357609	u1891	m124	CHANG	Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
L357608	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Suppose she should leave it?
L357607	u1891	m124	CHANG	Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
L357606	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
L357605	u1891	m124	CHANG	Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
L357604	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
L357603	u1891	m124	CHANG	Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
L357602	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes, charming.
L357601	u1891	m124	CHANG	Charming, isn't she?
L357598	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
L357597	u1891	m124	CHANG	Shall we have another?
L357596	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes. I'm afraid it does.
L357413	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
L357412	u1891	m124	CHANG	The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
L357411	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
L357410	u1891	m124	CHANG	The only one.
L357409	u1893	m124	CONWAY	One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
L357332	u1891	m124	CHANG	Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
L357331	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
L357330	u1891	m124	CHANG	I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
L357329	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I surprise you? Now that's news.
L357328	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
L357327	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
L357326	u1891	m124	CHANG	And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
L357325	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Very often.
L357324	u1891	m124	CHANG	"Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, ""He worried himself to death?"" or, ""This thing or that killed him?"""
L357323	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
L357322	u1891	m124	CHANG	You're startled?
L357321	u1893	m124	CONWAY	108 and still active?
L357320	u1891	m124	CHANG	Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
L357319	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, is it?
L357318	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
L357317	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, they didn't actually mean that.
L357316	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
L357315	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He amputated his own leg?
L357314	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
L357313	u1893	m124	CONWAY	When was all this?
L357312	u1891	m124	CHANG	A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
L357311	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who?
L357310	u1891	m124	CHANG	That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
L357309	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
L357308	u1891	m124	CHANG	Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
L357307	u1893	m124	CONWAY	?buy and sell?
L357306	u1891	m124	CHANG	Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
L357305	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
L357304	u1891	m124	CHANG	Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
L357303	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
L357302	u1891	m124	CHANG	Centuries.
L357301	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, it must have taken?
L357300	u1891	m124	CHANG	They were.
L357299	u1893	m124	CONWAY	But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
L357296	u1891	m124	CHANG	You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
L357295	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
L357294	u1891	m124	CHANG	Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
L357293	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
L357292	u1891	m124	CHANG	Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
L357291	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You have no disputes over women?
L357290	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
L357289	u1893	m124	CONWAY	How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
L357288	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, good heavens, no!
L357287	u1893	m124	CONWAY	How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
L357286	u1891	m124	CHANG	We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
L357285	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's intelligent.
L357284	u1891	m124	CHANG	To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including?  ?the excess of virtue itself.
L357283	u1891	m124	CHANG	We follow many.
L357282	u1893	m124	CONWAY	By the way, what religion do you follow here?
L357275	u1891	m124	CHANG	Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
L357274	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
L357273	u1891	m124	CHANG	There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
L357272	u1893	m124	CONWAY	For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
L357271	u1891	m124	CHANG	In time you will meet them all.
L357270	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who, for instance?
L357269	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, yes.
L357268	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So there are others?
L357267	u1891	m124	CHANG	Goodness, no!
L357266	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
L357265	u1891	m124	CHANG	It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
L357203	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
L357202	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And the wine - excellent.
L357160	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Thank you.
L357159	u1891	m124	CHANG	You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
L357154	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
L357153	u1891	m124	CHANG	Where is your mad pilot?
L357150	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction?
L357149	u1891	m124	CHANG	How do you do?
L357148	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And mine's Conway.
L357193	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
L357192	u1891	m124	CHANG	You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
L357191	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
L357190	u1891	m124	CHANG	Please let me help you.
L357189	u1895	m124	GLORIA	No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
L357188	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
L357187	u1895	m124	GLORIA	I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
L357186	u1891	m124	CHANG	Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
L357185	u1895	m124	GLORIA	You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
L357184	u1891	m124	CHANG	I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
L357183	u1895	m124	GLORIA	What do you want?
L357582	u1891	m124	CHANG	Thank you.
L357581	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, thank you. Thank you!
L357580	u1891	m124	CHANG	Then it's done.
L357579	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, immediately.
L357578	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
L357577	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
L357576	u1891	m124	CHANG	Splendid!
L357575	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
L357574	u1891	m124	CHANG	Now, what would you like to do?
L357573	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"Ungrateful fool . . . !  Those were my very words to myself last night. ""Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."""
L357572	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, no.
L357571	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, ""Lovey""?  Mr. Lovett! ""Mr. Lovett,"" I said, ""you are an ungrateful fool . . . """
L357570	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, I'm so glad.
L357569	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
L357568	u1891	m124	CHANG	You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
L357567	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
L357566	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes.
L357565	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
L357402	u1898	m124	LOVETT	The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
L357401	u1891	m124	CHANG	You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
L357224	u1891	m124	CHANG	Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
L357223	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"What exactly do you mean by ""almost any time now""?"
L357216	u1891	m124	CHANG	No.
L357215	u1898	m124	LOVETT	No porters here!!
L357214	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
L357213	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
L357617	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out?porters or no porters!
L357616	u1891	m124	CHANG	Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't?
L357615	u1894	m124	GEORGE	A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
L357406	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
L357405	u1891	m124	CHANG	The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
L357222	u1891	m124	CHANG	In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now?
L357221	u1894	m124	GEORGE	How can we get in touch with them?
L357220	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
L357212	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, dear.
L357211	u1894	m124	GEORGE	As far away as I ever want to be.
L357210	u1891	m124	CHANG	Are you so certain you are away from it?
L357209	u1894	m124	GEORGE	In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
L357156	u1891	m124	CHANG	Pardon me?
L357155	u1894	m124	GEORGE	We were just going to bury him when you came along.
L357761	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hey!
L357760	u1899	m124	MARIA	No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
L357743	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
L357742	u1899	m124	MARIA	Are you taking me?
L357734	u1899	m124	MARIA	No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
L357733	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're lying, aren't you?
L357730	u1899	m124	MARIA	I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
L357729	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes.
L357728	u1899	m124	MARIA	Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
L357727	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
L357726	u1899	m124	MARIA	He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
L357725	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault is dead.
L357724	u1899	m124	MARIA	The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
L357723	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
L357722	u1899	m124	MARIA	I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
L357721	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
L357720	u1899	m124	MARIA	It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
L357435	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
L357434	u1893	m124	CONWAY	But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
L357433	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
L357432	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
L357431	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
L357430	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, the girl at the piano?
L357429	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sondra Bizet.
L357428	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
L357427	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
L357425	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
L357424	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago?  ?you're still alive, Father Perrault!
L357423	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	What is it, my son?
L357422	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's astonishing - and incredible, but?
L357421	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as?
L357420	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
L357419	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Yes.
L357418	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Are you the High Lama?
L357417	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
L357627	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Do you think this will come in my time?
L357626	u1897	m124	LAMA	I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
L357624	u1897	m124	LAMA	Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
L357623	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mine?
L357622	u1897	m124	LAMA	You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
L357621	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
L357620	u1897	m124	LAMA	Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
L357763	u1893	m124	CONWAY	As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
L357762	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
L357759	u1893	m124	CONWAY	There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
L357758	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
L357750	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
L357749	u1894	m124	GEORGE	was saying?
L357748	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What was that?
L357747	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
L357741	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! We're wasting time!
L357740	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
L357739	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What about the others?
L357738	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, everything!
L357737	u1893	m124	CONWAY	The clothes?
L357736	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L357735	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You say the porters are waiting for us?
L357732	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
L357731	u1894	m124	GEORGE	She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
L357714	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
L357713	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
L357712	u1894	m124	GEORGE	So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
L357711	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
L357710	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're wrong, George.
L357709	u1894	m124	GEORGE	This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
L357708	u1893	m124	CONWAY	She came here in 1888!
L357707	u1894	m124	GEORGE	"What do you mean - ""fade away like an echo""?"
L357706	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
L357705	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why not?
L357704	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You can't take her away from here!
L357702	u1894	m124	GEORGE	She's going with me.
L357701	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What's she got to do with it?
L357700	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, the little Russian girl.
L357699	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Maria?
L357698	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
L357697	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
L357696	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
L357695	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
L357694	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'd go mad!
L357693	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
L357692	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
L357691	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, George . . .
L357690	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
L357689	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
L357688	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned?
L357687	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
L357686	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
L357685	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
L357684	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
L357683	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
L357682	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
L357681	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Is that all my story meant to you?
L357680	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
L357679	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't need any proof.
L357678	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
L357677	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
L357676	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
L357675	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So you think I'm mad?
L357674	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
L357672	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
L357671	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
L357670	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
L357669	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
L357668	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
L357667	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why not? What's going to stop me?
L357666	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You can't leave, George.
L357665	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
L357594	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't see that there's anything to say.
L357593	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
L357445	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
L357444	u1894	m124	GEORGE	For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of?
L357442	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why - I'm sorry - but I?
L357441	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
L357440	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Porters?
L357439	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What about the porters?
L357392	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right. Sorry, George.
L357391	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Let me up! Let me up!
L357387	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Chang! Chang! Chang!
L357386	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, come back!
L357385	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Let me go, Bob!
L357384	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, what do you think you're doing?
L357349	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Shhh!
L357348	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
L357347	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
L357346	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
L357345	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Porters?
L357344	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Nothing about the porters yet?
L357343	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
L357264	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's what's on the other side of the hill.
L357263	u1894	m124	GEORGE	There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
L357262	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Uh-huh.
L357261	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Chang's first question was about the pilot.
L357260	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
L357259	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
L357258	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well - I mean?
L357257	u1894	m124	GEORGE	That's what you said.
L357256	u1893	m124	CONWAY	"Did I say ""if""?"
L357255	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What do you mean if we should get out?
L357254	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
L357253	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
L357252	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
L357251	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
L357250	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know.
L357249	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What are you talking about?
L357248	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
L357247	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You talk as though you intend on staying.
L357246	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
L357245	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
L357244	u1893	m124	CONWAY	We've had plenty of it the last few days.
L357243	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
L357242	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello, George.  Cigarette?
L357108	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
L357107	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What's it mean?
L357106	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
L357105	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L357104	u1893	m124	CONWAY	See that spot?
L357103	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What is it?
L357101	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Dead?
L357100	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He's dead.
L357098	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
L357097	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What is it? Has he fainted?
L357084	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
L357083	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh George, come on.
L357064	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
L357063	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What are these people?
L357048	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
L357047	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, what are you going to do?
L357034	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
L357033	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, stop it!
L356995	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
L356994	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Do try to sleep, Bob.
L356993	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
L356991	u1893	m124	CONWAY	"Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, ""Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?""  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - ""Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?"" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants?  ?and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum."
L356990	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
L356989	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
L356988	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356987	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Did you say we saved ninety white people?
L356986	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, Bob.
L356985	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
L356982	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
L356981	u1894	m124	GEORGE	"How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, ""There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."""
L356980	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hurray!
L356979	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
L356978	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You?
L356977	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Just what I needed too.
L356943	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
L356942	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
L356926	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! Quick! This way.
L356925	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob, these are all that are left.
L356921	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Right, Bob.
L356920	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
L356919	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
L356918	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
L356904	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello? Colonel?
L356903	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356902	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And be sure that none of the natives get in.
L356901	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356900	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
L356899	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob! I think I hear motors!
L357152	u1893	m124	CONWAY	We'd be eternally grateful if you?
L357151	u1898	m124	LOVETT	At the mercy of a mad pilot.
L357080	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
L357079	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
L357067	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Where are we going? Huh?
L357066	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
L357060	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
L357059	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why, you - you? Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
L357058	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What do you suggest?
L357057	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
L357056	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
L357055	u1898	m124	LOVETT	In for what?
L357054	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I guess we're in for it.
L357052	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
L357051	u1898	m124	LOVETT	We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
L357050	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What if he refuses?
L357049	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Good.
L357046	u1898	m124	LOVETT	What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
L357045	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That fellow got on at Baskul.
L357044	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
L357043	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
L356941	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
L356940	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly?
L356939	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Where were you hiding?
L356936	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why aren't you registered through our office?
L356935	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
L356934	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Where did you come from?
L357564	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
L357563	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
L357561	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357560	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I'd love it!
L357559	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Would you like to wring my little neck?
L357558	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
L357557	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why, mother?
L357556	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
L357555	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I was just going to.
L357554	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
L357553	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357552	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
L357551	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Struggling, why?
L357550	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
L357549	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357548	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
L357547	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
L357546	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
L357545	u1900	m124	SONDRA	You see, it's not a dream.
L357544	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Ouch!
L357543	u1893	m124	CONWAY	When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
L357542	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Bump?
L357541	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
L357497	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
L357496	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
L357495	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I wonder.
L357494	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
L357493	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
L357492	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm so glad.
L357491	u1893	m124	CONWAY	On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
L357490	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
L357489	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
L357488	u1900	m124	SONDRA	What is?
L357485	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
L357484	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm thirty.
L357483	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
L357482	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes, I know.
L357481	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
L357480	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
L357479	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Thank you.
L357478	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
L357477	u1893	m124	CONWAY	There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
L357476	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
L357475	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
L357474	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
L357473	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes.
L357472	u1893	m124	CONWAY	A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
L357471	u1900	m124	SONDRA	As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
L357470	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
L357469	u1893	m124	CONWAY	A man whose life was empty!
L357468	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I saw a man whose life was empty.
L357467	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
L357466	u1900	m124	SONDRA	That was easy. I read your books.
L357465	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
L357464	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes. Hold this pigeon.
L357463	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Was this your idea?
L357460	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Oh, you mean my pigeons.
L357459	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
L357458	u1893	m124	CONWAY	hope you'll forgive me for?
L357457	u1900	m124	SONDRA	My name's Sondra.
L357456	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
L357654	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.  Barney!
L357653	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'll wait till you rot!
L357652	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
L357651	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
L357650	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
L357649	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
L357648	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Go? Where?
L357647	u1894	m124	GEORGE	How about you? Do you want to go?
L357231	u1894	m124	GEORGE	We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
L357230	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
L357205	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
L357204	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
L357147	u1898	m124	LOVETT	English!
L357146	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why, he's speaking English.
L357130	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
L357129	u1898	m124	LOVETT	What is it?
L357082	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
L357081	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What do you want him to do?
L357026	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It's Fenner.
L357025	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
L357024	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
L357023	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
L356938	u1898	m124	LOVETT	How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
L356937	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It would serve you right if you were left behind.
L357539	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
L357538	u1899	m124	MARIA	Thank you.
L357537	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right, I'll be there.
L357536	u1899	m124	MARIA	Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
L357535	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Perhaps.
L357534	u1899	m124	MARIA	I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
L357533	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
L357532	u1899	m124	MARIA	You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
L357278	u1899	m124	MARIA	Please don't go.
L357277	u1894	m124	GEORGE	EXCUSE ME?
L387158	u1915	m126	AGATHA	RUN!
L387157	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What --
L387156	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
L387153	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, Jesus...
L387152	u1915	m126	AGATHA	She's not alive, but she didn't die.
L387151	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She's still alive?
L387150	u1915	m126	AGATHA	She grew up.
L387149	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She died?
L387148	u1915	m126	AGATHA	The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
L387147	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who wanted her little girl back?
L387146	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
L387066	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I am going back.  I see myself there.
L387065	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha, you're never going back there.
L387064	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
L387063	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
L387062	u1915	m126	AGATHA	The other two will die without me.
L387061	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why?
L387060	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I have to go back.
L387059	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Someplace safe.
L387058	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Where are we going?
L386981	u1915	m126	AGATHA	But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
L386980	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
L386979	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Please, I want to go back...
L386977	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You were right.  I'm not being set up.
L386976	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Anderton --
L386975	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
L386973	u1915	m126	AGATHA	What is it?
L386972	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, God...
L386963	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
L386962	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Please --
L386961	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't.  I have to know.
L386959	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Anderton, leave.
L386958	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He's here.
L386939	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Wait.
L386938	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha...
L386937	u1915	m126	AGATHA	He won't.
L386936	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He'll turn around.
L386935	u1915	m126	AGATHA	No.  Follow him.
L386933	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
L386932	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Forget that guy --
L386931	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Drop some money.
L386927	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386926	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can you see the balloon man?
L386925	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha --
L386920	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha...
L386919	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Take it.
L386914	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who?
L386913	u1915	m126	AGATHA	They're inside.
L386912	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386828	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Is it now?
L386827	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386826	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Is it now?
L386825	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
L386291	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can you see?
L386290	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally!
L387155	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
L387154	u1928	m126	LARA	John?  What is it?
L387144	u1928	m126	LARA	I know... I do, too...
L387143	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
L387134	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Anne Lively...
L387133	u1928	m126	LARA	About who?
L387132	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Because I found out about her...
L387131	u1928	m126	LARA	Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
L387130	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Somewhere.
L387129	u1928	m126	LARA	Found?  Where?
L387128	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just some guy... they found.
L387127	u1928	m126	LARA	Then who was he?
L387126	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- but he didn't.
L386708	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- go blind.  I know.
L386707	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
L386702	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
L386701	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The nano... what?
L386700	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
L386699	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't even stand up --
L386698	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
L386697	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Here --
L386696	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How do I find the --
L386695	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
L386644	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
L386643	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
L386638	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
L386637	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You set your patients on fire!
L386636	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	They were performance pieces.
L386635	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You made those tapes...
L386634	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Yes, you did.
L386633	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I put you away --
L386631	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
L386630	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	From where?  D.C.?
L386629	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Oh, yes.
L386628	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We know each other?
L386627	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	You don't remember me, do you?
L386626	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
L386625	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It's all I could safely move.
L386624	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	That's not much.
L386620	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Whatever you say, John.
L386619	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
L386618	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Why?
L386617	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
L386616	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	And replace them with new ones.
L386615	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yeah --
L386614	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
L386613	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Right.  I know --
L386612	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
L386611	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's comforting.
L386610	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
L387166	u1923	m126	GIDEON	It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
L387165	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Lara --
L387164	u1923	m126	GIDEON	You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
L386348	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
L386347	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
L386346	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
L386345	u1923	m126	GIDEON	"Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, ""glitch?"""
L386344	u1923	m126	GIDEON	No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
L386343	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Try again.
L386342	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
L386339	u1923	m126	GIDEON	On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
L386338	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
L386329	u1923	m126	GIDEON	"Not to mention, ""Saved by the bell""."
L386328	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	... Graveyard shift.
L386327	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Hence the expression...
L386321	u1923	m126	GIDEON	I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
L386320	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You the only sentry?
L386319	u1923	m126	GIDEON	For that, we have to go for a ride.
L386318	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Show me just Agatha's data stream.
L386317	u1923	m126	GIDEON	That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
L386316	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	This is the official composite of the three precogs?
L386315	u1923	m126	GIDEON	That's an old one.  One of our first.
L386313	u1923	m126	GIDEON	This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
L386312	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Victim's a white female.
L386310	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Drowning.
L386309	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Kill type?
L386308	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
L386307	u1923	m126	GIDEON	I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
L386306	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
L386305	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You the sentry?
L387313	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
L387312	u1918	m126	BURGESS	No doubt.
L387311	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
L387301	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
L387300	u1918	m126	BURGESS	People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
L387254	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
L387253	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John --
L386470	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Everybody runs.
L386469	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You can't run --
L386468	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not getting halo'd.
L386467	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John.  Please.  Listen to me --
L386463	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
L386462	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
L386461	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
L386460	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Can you fake the cerebral output?
L386459	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
L386458	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
L386457	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
L386456	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
L386455	u1918	m126	BURGESS	All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
L386454	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
L386453	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And who the hell is that?
L386452	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Somebody named Leo Crow.
L386451	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
L386450	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
L386449	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
L386448	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
L386376	u1918	m126	BURGESS	No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
L386375	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We won't let them.
L386374	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
L386373	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm fine, Lamar.
L386372	u1918	m126	BURGESS	What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
L386371	u1918	m126	BURGESS	In the middle of the night?
L386370	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I go running down there.
L386369	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
L386368	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm fine.
L386367	u1918	m126	BURGESS	She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
L386366	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386365	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Lara called me.
L386364	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
L386363	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
L386362	u1918	m126	BURGESS	So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
L386361	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
L386354	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
L386353	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
L386219	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tuck in your shirt.
L386218	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I understand.  What's the other thing?
L386217	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
L386216	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yes, sir.
L386215	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
L386214	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I understand.  Sir.
L386213	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
L386212	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Don't apologize, John.
L386211	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
L386210	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
L386130	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Hang on, Lamar --
L386129	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
L386128	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh-huh...
L386127	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
L386126	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The nation votes this week...
L386125	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Don't worry, Lamar.
L386124	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tell me not to worry, John.
L386506	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
L386505	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	You don't have to do this, Chief.
L386504	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Everybody runs.
L386503	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
L386092	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I show a cop on horseback.
L386091	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
L386090	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
L386089	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	"What he's doing now, we call ""scrubbing the image"", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen."
L386081	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
L386080	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Uh, sir...
L386079	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
L386078	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
L386077	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're kidding, that's today?
L386076	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
L386070	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
L386069	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Seventeen minutes.
L386424	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Take your time.
L386423	u1926	m126	JAD	Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
L386422	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
L386418	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
L386417	u1926	m126	JAD	Any ID on the shooter yet?
L386416	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Confirm with trig and image.
L386415	u1926	m126	JAD	That was easy.
L386414	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
L386409	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
L386408	u1926	m126	JAD	I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
L386407	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
L386406	u1926	m126	JAD	The victim's name is Leo Crow.
L386400	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
L386399	u1926	m126	JAD	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
L386398	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Red Ball?
L386396	u1926	m126	JAD	We're in motion on something.
L386395	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
L386278	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Go back to work.  All of you.
L386277	u1926	m126	JAD	Sir?
L386276	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh-huh.  Jad?
L386275	u1926	m126	JAD	Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
L386274	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
L386149	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Did Marks close the front door?!
L386148	u1926	m126	JAD	What?
L386147	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Did he close the front door?
L386146	u1926	m126	JAD	Go ahead.
L386133	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Now look at him...
L386132	u1926	m126	JAD	Yeah?  So?
L386131	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
L386096	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Georgetown.
L386095	u1926	m126	JAD	The mall?
L386094	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No maglev system.
L386093	u1926	m126	JAD	Somewhere near the capital?
L386068	u1926	m126	JAD	From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
L386067	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
L386066	u1926	m126	JAD	Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
L386057	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Run the subscription list...
L386056	u1926	m126	JAD	We can't grab it...
L386041	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
L386040	u1926	m126	JAD	We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
L386039	u1926	m126	JAD	Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
L386038	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Okay, Jad, what's coming?
L386445	u1934	m126	WITWER	Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
L386444	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You gonna tell on me?
L386443	u1934	m126	WITWER	It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
L386442	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
L386441	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You set me up...
L386288	u1934	m126	WITWER	I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
L386287	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
L386286	u1934	m126	WITWER	Flaws.
L386285	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
L386284	u1934	m126	WITWER	At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
L386281	u1934	m126	WITWER	I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
L386280	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What does he think of your chosen line of work?
L386279	u1934	m126	WITWER	Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
L386273	u1934	m126	WITWER	The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
L386272	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just a nickname.
L386271	u1934	m126	WITWER	"But you call this room the ""temple""."
L386270	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
L386269	u1934	m126	WITWER	I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
L386251	u1934	m126	WITWER	I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
L386250	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	There's no question.  You don't have any.
L386249	u1934	m126	WITWER	If it's a question of authority.
L386248	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Maybe you didn't hear me.
L386247	u1934	m126	WITWER	So I'll be the first one to go in then?
L386246	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
L386245	u1934	m126	WITWER	Really?  You've never been inside?
L386244	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
L386243	u1934	m126	WITWER	To them.
L386242	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	To Hineman?
L386241	u1934	m126	WITWER	Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
L386240	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
L386237	u1934	m126	WITWER	Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
L386236	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
L386235	u1934	m126	WITWER	You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
L386234	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
L386233	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
L386232	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes.
L386231	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're certain?
L386230	u1934	m126	WITWER	Because it was going to fall.
L386229	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why did you catch that?
L386227	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yes, it is.
L386226	u1934	m126	WITWER	But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
L386140	u1934	m126	WITWER	You mind if I tag along?
L386139	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
L386138	u1934	m126	WITWER	As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
L386087	u1934	m126	WITWER	Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
L386086	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
L386792	u1933	m126	WALLY	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
L386791	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just go to the beginning!
L386784	u1933	m126	WALLY	There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
L386783	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Are these all of her previsions?
L386777	u1933	m126	WALLY	Oh... Hi, John.
L386776	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
L386775	u1933	m126	WALLY	Do I know you?  Who are you?
L386774	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally, listen to me...
L386301	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She said...
L386300	u1933	m126	WALLY	To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
L386299	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She spoke to me.
L386298	u1933	m126	WALLY	It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
L386297	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She was looking right at me.
L386296	u1933	m126	WALLY	She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
L386295	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
L386294	u1933	m126	WALLY	Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
L386266	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It helps if you don't think of them as human.
L386265	u1933	m126	WALLY	They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
L386257	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
L386256	u1933	m126	WALLY	I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
L386911	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh, I'll try...
L386910	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus, play it back...
L386903	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I guess that's all of it.
L386902	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What happened?  Where's the rest?
L386898	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Tell me how.
L386897	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Stop --
L386891	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Then take her to Radio Shack.
L386890	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	They don't belong to anybody.
L386889	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
L386888	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So now I need you to hack into her.
L386887	u1929	m126	RUFUS	So?
L386886	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
L386885	u1929	m126	RUFUS	No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
L386884	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
L386883	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
L386882	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
L386881	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Are you reading my mind right now?
L386879	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's right.
L386878	u1929	m126	RUFUS	She's a precog?
L386877	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus.  She's a precog.
L386876	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
L386875	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Well, hello there, honey-pie.
L386874	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I need help with her.
L386873	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
L386872	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I need your help.
L386871	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
L387192	u1931	m126	SEAN	Hold your breath, Dad...
L387191	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean, wait...
L387190	u1931	m126	SEAN	I'm your son.  I'm you.
L387189	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who are you?
L387188	u1931	m126	SEAN	Good-bye, Dad...
L387187	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I wanted to.
L387186	u1931	m126	SEAN	I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
L387185	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I was looking for you...
L387184	u1931	m126	SEAN	The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
L387183	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I forgive you...
L387182	u1931	m126	SEAN	Once I even told him I loved him.
L387181	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I forgive you.
L387180	u1931	m126	SEAN	I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
L387179	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean --
L387178	u1931	m126	SEAN	The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
L387177	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, Sean --
L387176	u1931	m126	SEAN	No.  He got tired of pretending.
L387175	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're alive?
L387174	u1931	m126	SEAN	I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
L387173	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What the hell.
L387172	u1931	m126	SEAN	Wanna hear something funny?
L387171	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It's a little late for that.
L387170	u1931	m126	SEAN	You gotta have faith, Dad.
L387169	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean -- you're not real.
L386718	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	All right, I'll try...
L386717	u1931	m126	SEAN	Come on!
L386716	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
L386715	u1931	m126	SEAN	Okay... now let me time you.
L386200	u1931	m126	SEAN	I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
L386199	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
L386196	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What a big boy.  How old are you?
L386195	u1931	m126	SEAN	I won!
L386193	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's great.
L386192	u1931	m126	SEAN	I scored a goal!
L387028	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Good-bye, Crow.
L387027	u1919	m126	CROW	You're not gonna kill me...
L387026	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Let go of the gun.
L387025	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Tell me!
L387024	u1919	m126	CROW	Kill me!
L387023	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who made you do this?
L387022	u1919	m126	CROW	If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
L387021	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Tell me, who was it, set this up?
L387020	u1919	m126	CROW	Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
L387019	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What about the picture --
L387016	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What the fuck is going on?
L387015	u1919	m126	CROW	I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
L387014	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
L387013	u1919	m126	CROW	Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
L387012	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
L387011	u1919	m126	CROW	Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
L387007	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who said I would?
L387006	u1919	m126	CROW	You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
L387005	u1919	m126	CROW	If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
L387004	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The precogs were wrong.
L387003	u1919	m126	CROW	But you have to.  They said you would.
L387002	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No.
L387001	u1919	m126	CROW	You're not gonna kill me?
L386996	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	NO!
L386995	u1919	m126	CROW	It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
L386994	u1919	m126	CROW	I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
L386993	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
L386992	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He's alive?
L386991	u1919	m126	CROW	... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
L386989	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
L386988	u1919	m126	CROW	Some -- somebody's father?
L386987	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Do you know who I am?
L386985	u1919	m126	CROW	Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
L386984	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
L386593	u1925	m126	IRIS	The female.
L386592	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Which one is that?
L386591	u1925	m126	IRIS	It's always in the more gifted of the three.
L386590	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How do I even know which one has it?
L386585	u1925	m126	IRIS	Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
L386584	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
L386583	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're insane or you think I am.
L386582	u1925	m126	IRIS	Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
L386581	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- and then walk out.
L386580	u1925	m126	IRIS	If... you have one.
L386579	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
L386578	u1925	m126	IRIS	Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
L386577	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Where?
L386576	u1925	m126	IRIS	The safest place of all.
L386575	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What safe place is that?
L386574	u1925	m126	IRIS	I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
L386573	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You said they're destroyed.
L386572	u1925	m126	IRIS	You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
L386571	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why should I trust you?
L386570	u1925	m126	IRIS	Hold that thought.
L386569	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not gonna kill anybody.
L386568	u1925	m126	IRIS	But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
L386567	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You want to bring it down.
L386566	u1925	m126	IRIS	Do you?  Really?
L386565	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I believe in that system...
L386564	u1925	m126	IRIS	The system would collapse.
L386563	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
L386562	u1925	m126	IRIS	Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
L386561	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
L386560	u1925	m126	IRIS	I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
L386559	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
L386558	u1925	m126	IRIS	I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
L386557	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
L386556	u1925	m126	IRIS	Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
L386555	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why?
L386554	u1925	m126	IRIS	Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
L386553	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
L386552	u1925	m126	IRIS	Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
L386551	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386549	u1925	m126	IRIS	I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
L386548	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So you won't help me?
L386547	u1925	m126	IRIS	How can you avoid a man you've never met?
L386546	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Not if I stay away from him.
L386545	u1925	m126	IRIS	And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
L386544	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
L386543	u1925	m126	IRIS	So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
L386542	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You say some of the children died?
L386541	u1925	m126	IRIS	Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
L386540	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	And how did Lamar become involved?
L386539	u1925	m126	IRIS	It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
L386537	u1925	m126	IRIS	You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
L386536	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're talking about the precogs...
L386535	u1925	m126	IRIS	The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
L386534	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Heal who?
L386533	u1925	m126	IRIS	I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
L386532	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You don't seem all that proud.
L386531	u1925	m126	IRIS	If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
L386530	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What's so funny?
L386528	u1925	m126	IRIS	And how would I know that?
L386527	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
L386526	u1925	m126	IRIS	Just what is it you think I can do for you?
L386522	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm... not... a... killer.
L386521	u1925	m126	IRIS	You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
L386516	u1925	m126	IRIS	The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
L386515	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The what?
L386514	u1925	m126	IRIS	Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
L386513	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm a little dizzy...
L386512	u1925	m126	IRIS	Something wrong?
L387054	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
L387053	u1928	m126	LARA	Then how did he --
L387052	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
L387051	u1928	m126	LARA	Oh, God, what did you do?
L387050	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	He's dead, Lara.
L387049	u1928	m126	LARA	John?
L387225	u1928	m126	LARA	Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
L387224	u1918	m126	BURGESS	All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
L387223	u1928	m126	LARA	Lamar --
L387222	u1918	m126	BURGESS	But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
L387220	u1928	m126	LARA	No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
L387219	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I understand.
L387217	u1928	m126	LARA	No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
L387216	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Sean --
L387215	u1928	m126	LARA	Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
L387213	u1928	m126	LARA	He also said Crow was a fake.
L387212	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We know why John was tagged.
L387211	u1928	m126	LARA	"John said something about him being set up because he ""found out about her."""
L387210	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't know who that is.
L387209	u1928	m126	LARA	Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
L387208	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Who?
L387205	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
L387204	u1928	m126	LARA	I thought you were retiring?
L387203	u1918	m126	BURGESS	It's insanity around here.
L387197	u1928	m126	LARA	You look great.
L387196	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
L387194	u1928	m126	LARA	No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
L387193	u1918	m126	BURGESS	This is all my fault.
L387251	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Thank you.  This is Burgess.
L387250	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	You have an emergency call on your private line.
L387243	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	I padded your expense account for the last six months.
L387242	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How did you get this?
L387241	u1918	m126	BURGESS	My God...
L387240	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	Congratulations, sir.
L387227	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I'll be right there.
L387226	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	Sir, the press conference is starting.
L387202	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Not.  Now.
L387201	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	He just wanted a few minutes before --
L387200	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tell him not now.
L387199	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	The guy from USA Today is here.
L387104	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
L387103	u1934	m126	WITWER	What?
L387102	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Shhh.  You know what I hear?
L387101	u1934	m126	WITWER	Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
L387100	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Yes.
L387099	u1934	m126	WITWER	So there is a way to fool the system?
L387098	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
L387097	u1934	m126	WITWER	Precog Deja Vu...
L387096	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
L387095	u1934	m126	WITWER	By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
L387094	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How?
L387093	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
L387092	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
L387091	u1934	m126	WITWER	I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
L387090	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
L387089	u1934	m126	WITWER	According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
L387088	u1934	m126	WITWER	This murder is happening at two different times.
L387087	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't understand --
L387086	u1934	m126	WITWER	Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
L387084	u1934	m126	WITWER	Not quite.
L387083	u1918	m126	BURGESS	It's the same prevision.
L387082	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
L387081	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
L387075	u1934	m126	WITWER	Wait, just a second...
L387074	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Good God.  What was that?
L387073	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Where are you?
L387072	u1934	m126	WITWER	I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
L387071	u1918	m126	BURGESS	What?
L387070	u1934	m126	WITWER	Lamar, I found something.
L386484	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't want John Anderton hurt.
L386483	u1934	m126	WITWER	Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
L386482	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He's my subordinate!
L386481	u1934	m126	WITWER	Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
L386480	u1918	m126	BURGESS	None of your damn business.
L386479	u1934	m126	WITWER	Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
L386478	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
L386477	u1934	m126	WITWER	Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
L386476	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
L386475	u1934	m126	WITWER	He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
L386870	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
L386869	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	No, I wanna kill my boss!
L386868	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
L386866	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
L386865	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	Right here.
L386864	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
L386863	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	I wanna kill my boss.
L386862	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
L387047	u1934	m126	WITWER	None.  This was arranged.
L387046	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	How many?
L387045	u1934	m126	WITWER	"I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an ""orgy of evidence"".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?"
L387044	u1934	m126	WITWER	Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
L387043	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
L387042	u1934	m126	WITWER	What kind of cop were you before this?
L387041	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
L387040	u1934	m126	WITWER	If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
L387039	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I don't know, why?
L387038	u1934	m126	WITWER	There a maid in this hotel?
L386858	u1934	m126	WITWER	No.  He can't...
L386857	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
L386856	u1934	m126	WITWER	He's trying to prove his innocence.
L386820	u1934	m126	WITWER	She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
L386819	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	We can stop him.
L386818	u1934	m126	WITWER	It doesn't matter.  He wins.
L386768	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Two?
L386767	u1934	m126	WITWER	There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
L386604	u1934	m126	WITWER	Because he thinks he's innocent.
L386603	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
L386602	u1934	m126	WITWER	Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
L386600	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	They're everywhere.
L386599	u1934	m126	WITWER	There's thousands of units like this one.
L386598	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
L386496	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes, I know.
L386495	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
L386473	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	What?!
L386472	u1934	m126	WITWER	Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
L386471	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
L386239	u1934	m126	WITWER	Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
L386238	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	"Because of the nature of murder.  ""There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another""."
L386221	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
L386220	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
L386110	u1934	m126	WITWER	People have gotten the message.  Gum?
L386109	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
L386108	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	That's the Red Ball Alarm.
L386107	u1934	m126	WITWER	Can't they shut that off?
L386103	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
L386102	u1934	m126	WITWER	So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
L386098	u1934	m126	WITWER	Nice to meet you.  Gum?
L386097	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	This is Evanna, the team pilot.
L387238	u1927	m126	KNOTT	"You ""friend's"" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder..."
L387237	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	John Anderton was my friend!
L387236	u1927	m126	KNOTT	Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
L387235	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Why don't I feel like celebrating?
L386741	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Knott!
L386740	u1927	m126	KNOTT	People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
L386729	u1927	m126	KNOTT	It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
L386728	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I think you're swell company, Knott.
L386727	u1927	m126	KNOTT	That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
L386154	u1924	m126	HOWARD	I forgot my glasses.
L386153	u1930	m126	SARAH	Howard --
L386120	u1924	m126	HOWARD	Sure.  Raincheck.
L386119	u1930	m126	SARAH	Raincheck?
L386118	u1924	m126	HOWARD	Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
L386117	u1930	m126	SARAH	I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
L386116	u1924	m126	HOWARD	We could have lunch together.
L386114	u1924	m126	HOWARD	I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
L386113	u1930	m126	SARAH	What about your meeting?
L386065	u1930	m126	SARAH	How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
L386064	u1924	m126	HOWARD	The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
L386063	u1930	m126	SARAH	Who?
L386062	u1924	m126	HOWARD	He looks familiar.
L386692	u1934	m126	WITWER	But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
L386691	u1928	m126	LARA	I haven't seen him in two years.
L386690	u1934	m126	WITWER	To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
L386689	u1928	m126	LARA	To what?  Trap him?
L386688	u1934	m126	WITWER	You know I need to use you.
L386687	u1928	m126	LARA	I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
L386686	u1934	m126	WITWER	Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
L386685	u1934	m126	WITWER	Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
L386684	u1928	m126	LARA	He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
L386683	u1934	m126	WITWER	He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
L386682	u1928	m126	LARA	The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
L386681	u1934	m126	WITWER	What was it then?
L386680	u1928	m126	LARA	It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
L386679	u1934	m126	WITWER	You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
L386678	u1928	m126	LARA	Yes.
L386677	u1934	m126	WITWER	But John was with him at the pool?
L386676	u1928	m126	LARA	It was nobody's fault.
L386675	u1934	m126	WITWER	You mean after he lost your son.
L386674	u1928	m126	LARA	Since right after we lost our son.
L386671	u1934	m126	WITWER	Have you been there recently?
L386670	u1928	m126	LARA	That was our apartment.
L386669	u1934	m126	WITWER	So you haven't seen his apartment?
L386668	u1928	m126	LARA	No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
L386667	u1934	m126	WITWER	You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
L386666	u1928	m126	LARA	No.
L386665	u1934	m126	WITWER	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
L386664	u1928	m126	LARA	I don't have any sugar either.
L386662	u1934	m126	WITWER	He's not here now, is he?
L386661	u1928	m126	LARA	We used to, every summer.
L386660	u1934	m126	WITWER	Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
L386659	u1928	m126	LARA	I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
L386658	u1934	m126	WITWER	Cream and sugar.
L386657	u1928	m126	LARA	Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
L386656	u1934	m126	WITWER	I like it.
L386655	u1928	m126	LARA	Yes.
L386654	u1934	m126	WITWER	This your work?
L386653	u1928	m126	LARA	I know who you are.
L386652	u1934	m126	WITWER	My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
L386815	u1934	m126	WITWER	Jesus...
L386814	u1933	m126	WALLY	Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
L386813	u1934	m126	WITWER	Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
L386812	u1933	m126	WALLY	You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
L386811	u1934	m126	WITWER	Wally, the other two can still function, right?
L386810	u1934	m126	WITWER	But there's still the other two.
L386809	u1933	m126	WALLY	What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
L386808	u1934	m126	WITWER	What does he want with a precog?
L386807	u1933	m126	WALLY	They've never been separated before.
L386260	u1934	m126	WITWER	Tell me how all this works.
L386259	u1933	m126	WALLY	Shhh!  They're sleeping.
L386258	u1934	m126	WITWER	Nice to meet you, Wally.
L422325	u2355	m151	ELLIS	You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
L422324	u2350	m151	BELL	I'm... discouraged.
L422323	u2355	m151	ELLIS	You're discouraged.
L422322	u2350	m151	BELL	Most don't.
L422321	u2355	m151	ELLIS	...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
L422320	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
L422319	u2350	m151	BELL	No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
L422318	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Nineteen zero and nine.
L422317	u2350	m151	BELL	When did he die?
L422316	u2355	m151	ELLIS	...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
L422314	u2350	m151	BELL	Yes I do.
L422313	u2355	m151	ELLIS	You don't know what he thinks.
L422312	u2350	m151	BELL	...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
L422311	u2350	m151	BELL	I don't know. I feel overmatched.
L422310	u2355	m151	ELLIS	How come're you doin that?
L422309	u2350	m151	BELL	Yes, you've circled round.
L422308	u2355	m151	ELLIS	...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
L422307	u2355	m151	ELLIS	All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
L422306	u2350	m151	BELL	I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
L422305	u2355	m151	ELLIS	I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
L422304	u2350	m151	BELL	What would you a done if he'd been released?
L422303	u2355	m151	ELLIS	In Angola. Yeah.
L422302	u2350	m151	BELL	That man that shot you died in prison.
L422301	u2355	m151	ELLIS	I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
L422300	u2350	m151	BELL	How fresh is this coffee?
L422299	u2355	m151	ELLIS	'Predate it.
L422298	u2350	m151	BELL	Want a cup?
L422297	u2355	m151	ELLIS	She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
L422296	u2350	m151	BELL	Didn't know there was any.
L422295	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
L422294	u2350	m151	BELL	I am older.
L422293	u2355	m151	ELLIS	You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
L422292	u2350	m151	BELL	How you been, Ellis?
L422291	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
L422290	u2350	m151	BELL	How many a those things you got now?
L422289	u2355	m151	ELLIS	I deduced it. Once you walked in.
L422288	u2350	m151	BELL	But -- how'd you know it was mine?
L422287	u2355	m151	ELLIS	What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
L422286	u2350	m151	BELL	You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
L422285	u2355	m151	ELLIS	How's that?
L422284	u2350	m151	BELL	You heard it?
L422283	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Who else'd be in your truck.
L422282	u2350	m151	BELL	How'd you know I was here.
L422279	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
L422278	u2350	m151	BELL	Hard to believe.
L422277	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
L422276	u2350	m151	BELL	Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
L422275	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
L422274	u2350	m151	BELL	Oh yes.
L422273	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	He's real all right.
L422272	u2350	m151	BELL	I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
L422271	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	Well what would you call him.
L422270	u2350	m151	BELL	I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
L422269	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
L422268	u2350	m151	BELL	Uh-huh.
L422267	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	None of that explains your man though.
L422266	u2350	m151	BELL	Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
L422265	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	"Try ""old"" on for size."
L422264	u2350	m151	BELL	...I don't know what I do feel like.
L422263	u2350	m151	BELL	Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
L422262	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
L422261	u2350	m151	BELL	Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
L422260	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
L422259	u2350	m151	BELL	Yes.
L422258	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
L422257	u2350	m151	BELL	I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
L422256	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
L422255	u2350	m151	BELL	No money in his room there?
L422252	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
L422251	u2350	m151	BELL	No ID in her room?
L422250	u2364	m151	ROSCOE	I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
L422248	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	No.
L422247	u2350	m151	BELL	Carla Jean...
L422213	u2350	m151	BELL	Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
L422212	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
L422211	u2350	m151	BELL	Yes ma'am, I do.
L422210	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?

L422061	u2350	m151	BELL	I don't know. My mind wanders.
L422060	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
L422053	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	He can take all comers.
L422052	u2350	m151	BELL	I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
L422051	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	He won't neither. He never has.
L422050	u2350	m151	BELL	These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
L422049	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
L422048	u2350	m151	BELL	Some pretty bad people.
L422047	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	Who's he in trouble with then?
L422046	u2350	m151	BELL	It's not me he's in trouble with.

L422041	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	No I ain't.
L422040	u2350	m151	BELL	You ain't heard from him?
L422039	u2351	m151	CARLA JEAN	Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
L422117	u2350	m151	BELL	My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...

L422093	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	...I know where you are.
L422092	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Do you know where I'm going?
L422091	u2360	m151	MOSS	Why would I care where you're going.
L422090	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
L422089	u2360	m151	MOSS	I don't need to talk to you.
L422088	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	...You need to talk to me.
L422087	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You know who it is.
L422086	u2360	m151	MOSS	Who is this.
L422182	u2358	m151	MAN AT CHAIR	I see.
L422181	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
L422180	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
L422179	u2358	m151	MAN AT CHAIR	He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
L422178	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
L422177	u2358	m151	MAN AT CHAIR	Nobody. Accounting.
L422176	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Yes.
L422175	u2358	m151	MAN AT CHAIR	...Me?
L421688	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
L421687	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	...Where you want me to put it?
L421686	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
L421685	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Sir?
L421684	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	...Don't put it in your pocket.
L421682	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	All right. Heads then.
L421681	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You stand to win everything. Call it.
L421680	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	How's that?
L421679	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Everything.
L421678	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
L421677	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
L421676	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	No.
L421675	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
L421674	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	I didn't put nothin' up.
L421673	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
L421672	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
L421671	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Just call it.
L421670	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	For what?
L421669	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Yes.
L421668	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Call it?
L421667	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Call it.
L421666	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	I don't know. I couldn't say.
L421665	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
L421664	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Sir?
L421663	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
L421662	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
L421661	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	...If that's the way you wanna put it.
L421660	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You married into it.
L421659	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
L421658	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You married into it.
L421657	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
L421656	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You've lived here all your life?
L421655	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Yes I do.
L421654	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You live in that house behind the store?
L421653	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Well... I need to close now --
L421652	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You said that.
L421651	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
L421650	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	I could come back then.
L421649	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
L421648	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Well...
L421647	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
L421646	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Sir?
L421645	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	...What time do you go to bed.
L421644	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	I said you don't know what you're talking about.
L421643	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Sir?
L421642	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
L421641	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Generally around dark. At dark.
L421640	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Now is not a time. What time do you close.
L421639	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Now. We close now.
L421638	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	What time do you close?
L421637	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Yessir.
L421636	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	See about closing.
L421635	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Well... I need to see about closin'.
L421634	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You already asked me that.
L421633	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Will there be anything else?
L421632	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
L421631	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	With anything?
L421630	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	With what?
L421629	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Is somethin' wrong?
L421628	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	I don't know. Will there?
L421627	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	...Will there be somethin' else?
L421625	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
L421624	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	I was just passin' the time.
L421623	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Didn't mean nothin'.
L421622	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	I didn't mean nothin' by it.
L421621	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
L421620	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	I seen you was from Dallas.
L421619	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	What way would that be?
L421618	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Y'all getting any rain up your way?
L421617	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	This. And the gas.
L421616	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Sixty-nine cent.
L421615	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	How much?
L422150	u2353	m151	CLERK	No sir, it's unusual.
L422149	u2360	m151	MOSS	You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
L422148	u2353	m151	CLERK	Okay.
L422147	u2360	m151	MOSS	Good. I need everything else.
L421943	u2360	m151	MOSS	There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
L421942	u2353	m151	CLERK	I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
L421940	u2353	m151	CLERK	Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.

L421937	u2360	m151	MOSS	One room, one night.
L421891	u2360	m151	MOSS	Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
L421890	u2353	m151	CLERK	Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
L421889	u2360	m151	MOSS	The kind with the most poles.
L421888	u2353	m151	CLERK	What kind of tent?
L421887	u2360	m151	MOSS	Never mind.  I want a tent.
L421886	u2353	m151	CLERK	Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
L421885	u2360	m151	MOSS	Somethin' like that.
L421884	u2353	m151	CLERK	You already have the tent?
L421883	u2360	m151	MOSS	Uh-huh.
L421882	u2353	m151	CLERK	Tent poles.
L421880	u2353	m151	CLERK	They'll give you a wallop.
L421879	u2360	m151	MOSS	Uh-huh. Double ought.
L421878	u2353	m151	CLERK	Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
L421858	u2354	m151	DRIVER	Let's just call it square.
L421857	u2360	m151	MOSS	I want you to take me to another motel.
L421856	u2354	m151	DRIVER	Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
L421855	u2360	m151	MOSS	It's all right.
L421854	u2354	m151	DRIVER	I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
L421853	u2360	m151	MOSS	...Keep going. Don't stop.

L421850	u2354	m151	DRIVER	What room?
L421849	u2360	m151	MOSS	Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
L421936	u2357	m151	MAN	Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
L421935	u2365	m151	WELLS	I'm sorry.
L421934	u2357	m151	MAN	...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
L421933	u2365	m151	WELLS	Can I get my parking ticket validated?
L421932	u2357	m151	MAN	Yes?
L421931	u2365	m151	WELLS	...I'm wondering...
L421929	u2357	m151	MAN	You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
L421928	u2365	m151	WELLS	Okay. We can stop that.
L421927	u2357	m151	MAN	He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
L421925	u2357	m151	MAN	I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
L421924	u2365	m151	WELLS	What do you want to know?
L421923	u2357	m151	MAN	That's not an answer.

L421915	u2357	m151	MAN	We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
L421914	u2365	m151	WELLS	No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
L421913	u2357	m151	MAN	You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
L421912	u2365	m151	WELLS	November the 28th, last year.
L421911	u2357	m151	MAN	When did you last see him.

L422240	u2360	m151	MOSS	Then you'll like me.
L422239	u2367	m151	WOMAN	Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.

L422237	u2367	m151	WOMAN	What else then?

L421836	u2360	m151	MOSS	I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.

L422036	u2365	m151	WELLS	No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
L422035	u2360	m151	MOSS	If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
L422034	u2365	m151	WELLS	...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
L422033	u2365	m151	WELLS	No. You don't.

L422028	u2365	m151	WELLS	He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
L422027	u2360	m151	MOSS	Maybe he should be worried. About me.
L422026	u2365	m151	WELLS	To kill your wife.
L422025	u2360	m151	MOSS	Why would he go to Odessa?
L422023	u2360	m151	MOSS	Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
L422022	u2365	m151	WELLS	Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
L422021	u2360	m151	MOSS	So what does that make me? Your buddy?

L422017	u2360	m151	MOSS	What did I say?
L422016	u2365	m151	WELLS	Pot metal?
L422015	u2360	m151	MOSS	I didn't say braze.
L422014	u2365	m151	WELLS	I don't mean braze.
L422013	u2360	m151	MOSS	Yes.
L422012	u2365	m151	WELLS	Cast iron?

L422010	u2365	m151	WELLS	Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
L422009	u2360	m151	MOSS	I'm a welder.

L421996	u2360	m151	MOSS	Sugar?
L421995	u2365	m151	WELLS	I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
L421994	u2360	m151	MOSS	How would you describe him?
L421993	u2365	m151	WELLS	I don't think that's how I would describe him.
L421992	u2360	m151	MOSS	What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
L421991	u2365	m151	WELLS	...But that won't last.
L421989	u2360	m151	MOSS	I know, I've seen him. Sort of.

L422130	u2360	m151	MOSS	No sir.
L422129	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?

L422125	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
L422124	u2360	m151	MOSS	I don't know. American citizens.
L422123	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
L439849	u2460	m158	ELLIE	He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
L439848	u2461	m158	JUD	Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
L439767	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Is that right, dad?
L439766	u2461	m158	JUD	They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
L439548	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yes--
L439547	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
L439546	u2460	m158	ELLIE	What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
L439543	u2461	m158	JUD	It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
L439542	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Well...I guess not.
L439541	u2461	m158	JUD	Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
L439532	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh.
L439531	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Bite?
L439530	u2461	m158	JUD	Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
L439512	u2461	m158	JUD	You'll see soon enough, hon.
L439511	u2460	m158	ELLIE	But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
L439464	u2461	m158	JUD	And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
L439463	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
L439462	u2461	m158	JUD	Who might you be, little Miss?
L439942	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I will. Come and kiss me.
L439941	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Please hurry.
L439921	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Of course I will.
L439920	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
L439919	u2464	m158	RACHEL	There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
L439918	u2460	m158	ELLIE	He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
L439917	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
L439916	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
L439909	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
L439908	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Ellie...Ellie...what...
L439907	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late!
L439838	u2464	m158	RACHEL	In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
L439837	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
L439574	u2460	m158	ELLIE	But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
L439573	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Honey, Church will be fine.
L439438	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yaay!
L439437	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Yes, but the rope might be--
L439434	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Am I really gonna have my own room?
L439433	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It's gorgeous!
L439903	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I swear.
L439902	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Do you swear?
L439900	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
L439899	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
L439898	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
L439851	u2460	m158	ELLIE	And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
L439850	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie--
L439808	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
L439807	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Then why do I have to go to bed?
L439806	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm sure you're not.
L439805	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I'm not tired!
L439802	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
L439801	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yeah, sure.
L439800	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
L439799	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I don't get it.
L439798	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
L439797	u2460	m158	ELLIE	You believe in it.
L439796	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
L439795	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Do you believe that?
L439794	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
L439793	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
L439792	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
L439791	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
L439790	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But don't you dare say that.
L439789	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
L439788	u2460	m158	ELLIE	At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
L439787	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
L439786	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What's up, sugar?
L439784	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
L439783	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Huh?
L439782	u2460	m158	ELLIE	No more chocolate chip cookies.
L439781	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie? What's wrong?
L439772	u2462	m158	LOUIS	That's enough, Ellen.
L439771	u2460	m158	ELLIE	She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
L439763	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I hate that smell.
L439762	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
L439759	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I know.
L439758	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Because you promised.
L439757	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439756	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Is he really all right?
L439755	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
L439754	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
L439708	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
L439707	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
L439572	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
L439571	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Good God! Where'd you hear that?
L439559	u2460	m158	ELLIE	It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
L439558	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
L439557	u2460	m158	ELLIE	In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
L439556	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
L439555	u2460	m158	ELLIE	That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
L439550	u2460	m158	ELLIE	To remember.
L439549	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
L439534	u2462	m158	LOUIS	For a little while.
L439533	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
L439529	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Well, I thought it was safe--
L439528	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
L439468	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yayyy!
L439467	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No-I guess not.
L439449	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
L439448	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
L439436	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yaay!
L439435	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439933	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't bother. I'm coming home.
L439932	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
L439931	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Was it Pascow?
L439930	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
L439929	u2461	m158	JUD	No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
L439522	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
L439521	u2464	m158	RACHEL	How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
L439466	u2461	m158	JUD	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
L439465	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
L439461	u2461	m158	JUD	No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
L439460	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
L439459	u2461	m158	JUD	Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
L439869	u2461	m158	JUD	Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
L439868	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
L439866	u2461	m158	JUD	And because the dead walked.
L439865	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
L439864	u2461	m158	JUD	I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
L439863	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
L439862	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Shit! Look at this mess!
L439861	u2461	m158	JUD	--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
L439859	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm thinking about going to bed.
L439858	u2461	m158	JUD	You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
L439857	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
L439845	u2461	m158	JUD	Louis--
L439844	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
L439843	u2461	m158	JUD	Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
L439780	u2461	m158	JUD	Nope. He's your cat now.
L439779	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's Ellie's cat.
L439778	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
L439777	u2462	m158	LOUIS	"My father used to have a saying, Jud-- ""God sees the truth, but waits."""
L439776	u2461	m158	JUD	Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
L439774	u2462	m158	LOUIS	This babe has said enough.
L439773	u2461	m158	JUD	Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
L439770	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well...a touch of the flu...
L439769	u2461	m158	JUD	Rachel not feeling well?
L439744	u2461	m158	JUD	Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
L439743	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What?
L439742	u2461	m158	JUD	A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
L439741	u2461	m158	JUD	She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
L439740	u2462	m158	LOUIS	A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
L439739	u2461	m158	JUD	Why, then, things should be fine.
L439738	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439737	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
L439735	u2461	m158	JUD	Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
L439734	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You and this old Indian rag-man--
L439732	u2461	m158	JUD	Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
L439731	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Wendigo?
L439730	u2461	m158	JUD	They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
L439728	u2461	m158	JUD	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
L439727	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Can I have another one?
L439726	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
L439725	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
L439724	u2461	m158	JUD	Wouldn't wash?
L439723	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
L439722	u2461	m158	JUD	Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
L439721	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What did we do, Jud?
L439720	u2461	m158	JUD	I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
L439704	u2461	m158	JUD	No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
L439703	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But--
L439697	u2461	m158	JUD	Because it's right.
L439696	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, why am I doing all this?
L439695	u2461	m158	JUD	Don't worry about that.
L439694	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Doesn't look like they last long.
L439693	u2461	m158	JUD	Your cairn.
L439692	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What are those for?
L439689	u2461	m158	JUD	Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
L439688	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
L439687	u2461	m158	JUD	You want to rest a bit before you start?
L439686	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I guess so...but...
L439685	u2461	m158	JUD	I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
L439684	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Why? For God's sake, why?
L439683	u2461	m158	JUD	The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
L439682	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Whose burying ground?
L439681	u2461	m158	JUD	This was their burying ground, Louis.
L439680	u2461	m158	JUD	This time I mean it.
L439679	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You keep saying that.
L439678	u2461	m158	JUD	Almost there, Louis.
L439677	u2461	m158	JUD	Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
L439676	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's funny, all right.
L439675	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You're telling me.
L439674	u2461	m158	JUD	There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
L439672	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh.
L439671	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Is there quicksand?
L439670	u2461	m158	JUD	Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
L439668	u2461	m158	JUD	You'll see before long. Let's go.
L439667	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
L439666	u2461	m158	JUD	No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
L439660	u2461	m158	JUD	Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
L439659	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm not climbing that.
L439658	u2461	m158	JUD	No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
L439657	u2462	m158	LOUIS	We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
L439656	u2461	m158	JUD	The place we're going is on the other side of that.
L439655	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What do you mean?
L439654	u2461	m158	JUD	We're still not where we're going.
L439653	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
L439652	u2461	m158	JUD	What say, Louis?
L439650	u2461	m158	JUD	Then come on.
L439649	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes, but--
L439648	u2461	m158	JUD	Does she love the cat?
L439647	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But--
L439646	u2461	m158	JUD	It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
L439645	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
L439644	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
L439643	u2461	m158	JUD	No need to apologize.
L439641	u2461	m158	JUD	Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
L439640	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't know.

L439638	u2461	m158	JUD	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
L439637	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Bagged cat. What a mess.
L439636	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439635	u2461	m158	JUD	Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
L439634	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
L439633	u2461	m158	JUD	I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
L439632	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's Church.
L439631	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
L439630	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
L439629	u2462	m158	LOUIS	For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
L439628	u2461	m158	JUD	Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
L439553	u2461	m158	JUD	Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
L439552	u2462	m158	LOUIS	My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
L439545	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think it is so, Ellie.
L439544	u2461	m158	JUD	No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
L439536	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
L439535	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I can hardly read these.
L439516	u2461	m158	JUD	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
L439515	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Not yet...how much further is it?
L439514	u2461	m158	JUD	Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
L439513	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?

L439499	u2461	m158	JUD	I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
L439498	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Nice.
L439495	u2461	m158	JUD	The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
L439494	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What?
L439493	u2461	m158	JUD	Allman Brothers.
L439492	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What were you listening to?

L439472	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, maybe I----
L439471	u2461	m158	JUD	Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
L439470	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Hey--they actually found the place!
L439914	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
L439913	u2463	m158	PASCOW	Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
L439912	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
L439747	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You don't understand--
L439746	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
L439624	u2463	m158	PASCOW	Remember.
L439623	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Leave me alone!
L439622	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
L439621	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
L439620	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
L439619	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
L439890	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm sure.
L439889	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Louis, are you sure?
L439888	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
L439887	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
L439886	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You better get going, hon.
L439819	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You're doing fine.
L439818	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm going to try to do better.
L439817	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes, I guess I do.
L439816	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
L439815	u2462	m158	LOUIS	That's forgotten.
L439814	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
L439811	u2464	m158	RACHEL	That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
L439810	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
L439809	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I heard you tonight.
L439627	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Good d--
L439626	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I got eggs down here!
L439625	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Getting there.
L439586	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
L439585	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Thank you, Louis.
L439583	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
L439582	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, honey...you know that...
L439581	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And Church will be fine.
L439580	u2464	m158	RACHEL	You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
L439579	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
L439578	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I just said--
L439577	u2464	m158	RACHEL	That's enough of that kind of talk!
L439576	u2462	m158	LOUIS	According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
L439575	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
L439565	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
L439564	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
L439563	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
L439562	u2462	m158	LOUIS	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
L439561	u2464	m158	RACHEL	She's finally asleep.
L439524	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
L439523	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think it's rather extraordinary.
L439508	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It's beautiful!
L439507	u2462	m158	LOUIS	My God!
L439483	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Did you see his shirt?
L439482	u2464	m158	RACHEL	---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
L439481	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
L439480	u2464	m158	RACHEL	You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
L439477	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
L439476	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
L439475	u2462	m158	LOUIS	The movers--
L439458	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
L439457	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Thank you. Thank you so much.
L439454	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jesus, the road!
L439453	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Gage's gone!
L439443	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Come on--let's parole 'em.
L439442	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And Buckaroo Banzai.
L439440	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Louis, the house is beautiful.
L439439	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Let her go. It's cool.
L461809	u2570	m167	BABY SITTER	Goodnight.
L461808	u2574	m167	JEFF	He has it. Thank you.
L461807	u2570	m167	BABY SITTER	Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
L461806	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
L461805	u2570	m167	BABY SITTER	I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
L461804	u2574	m167	JEFF	Oh. When are they expected home?
L461803	u2570	m167	BABY SITTER	This is the baby sitter.
L461802	u2574	m167	JEFF	This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
L461801	u2570	m167	BABY SITTER	This is Doyle's house.
L461063	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Don't worry -- it comes off today.
L461062	u2571	m167	BRYCE	But his leg!
L461061	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Name me a better photographer.
L461060	u2571	m167	BRYCE	Jefferies?
L461059	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
L461058	u2571	m167	BRYCE	I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
L461057	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
L461056	u2571	m167	BRYCE	From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
L461055	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
L461656	u2572	m167	DOYLE	That's what they call a family problem.
L461655	u2575	m167	LISA	I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
L461651	u2575	m167	LISA	Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
L461650	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
L461648	u2572	m167	DOYLE	When the lock is broken -- yes.
L461647	u2575	m167	LISA	Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
L461634	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
L461633	u2575	m167	LISA	Like disposing of their wives?
L461623	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Namely?
L461622	u2575	m167	LISA	It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
L461872	u2572	m167	DOYLE	If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
L461871	u2574	m167	JEFF	Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
L461870	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
L461869	u2574	m167	JEFF	Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
L461868	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Where'd they take Lisa?
L461867	u2574	m167	JEFF	In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
L461866	u2572	m167	DOYLE	"You think perhaps it was ""old hambone?"""
L461865	u2574	m167	JEFF	I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
L461864	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Like an old hambone?
L461863	u2574	m167	JEFF	A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
L461862	u2572	m167	DOYLE	A possibility.
L461861	u2574	m167	JEFF	Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
L461860	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Like what?
L461859	u2574	m167	JEFF	I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
L461858	u2572	m167	DOYLE	I told you that --
L461857	u2574	m167	JEFF	My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
L461856	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Your Lisa?
L461855	u2574	m167	JEFF	Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
L461854	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
L461853	u2574	m167	JEFF	Tom, I've got something real big for you.
L461852	u2572	m167	DOYLE	This is Doyle, Jeff.
L461851	u2574	m167	JEFF	Jefferies.
L461674	u2572	m167	DOYLE	The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
L461673	u2574	m167	JEFF	"That depends on who ""they"" were."
L461672	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
L461661	u2574	m167	JEFF	All the things I hate.
L461660	u2572	m167	DOYLE	If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
L461640	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Your logic is backward.
L461639	u2574	m167	JEFF	But I'm not a killer!
L461638	u2572	m167	DOYLE	And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
L461637	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well, in the garage, back home, we --
L461636	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Did you ever own a saw?
L461625	u2572	m167	DOYLE	You figured that out, huh?
L461624	u2574	m167	JEFF	That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
L461621	u2572	m167	DOYLE	You sure it belongs to his wife?
L461620	u2574	m167	JEFF	He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
L461619	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Jewelry?
L461608	u2574	m167	JEFF	Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
L461607	u2572	m167	DOYLE	You think he's getting out of here?
L461606	u2574	m167	JEFF	Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
L461517	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Mrs. Thorwald.
L461516	u2574	m167	JEFF	Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
L461514	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Oh -- I almost forgot!
L461513	u2574	m167	JEFF	Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
L461511	u2574	m167	JEFF	"Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: ""Your request for transfer turned down --"""
L461510	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Ever get an answer?
L461509	u2574	m167	JEFF	You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
L461508	u2572	m167	DOYLE	How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
L461507	u2572	m167	DOYLE	One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
L461506	u2574	m167	JEFF	What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
L461505	u2572	m167	DOYLE	A detective's nightmare.
L461504	u2574	m167	JEFF	By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
L461503	u2572	m167	DOYLE	"I can hear myself starting out. ""Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --""  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes."
L461502	u2574	m167	JEFF	Give him evidence.
L461501	u2572	m167	DOYLE	"At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase ""search warrant"" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence."
L461500	u2574	m167	JEFF	Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
L461499	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
L461498	u2574	m167	JEFF	What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
L461497	u2572	m167	DOYLE	I can't do it even if he's gone.
L461496	u2574	m167	JEFF	I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
L461495	u2572	m167	DOYLE	I can't do that.
L461494	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
L461493	u2572	m167	DOYLE	If possible -- both.
L461492	u2574	m167	JEFF	Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
L461491	u2572	m167	DOYLE	I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
L461490	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
L461489	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Jeff -- huh?
L461488	u2574	m167	JEFF	A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
L461487	u2572	m167	DOYLE	The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
L461486	u2574	m167	JEFF	"Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, ""Grand Central Or Bust!""?"
L461485	u2572	m167	DOYLE	The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
L461484	u2574	m167	JEFF	The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
L461483	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Who left -- where?
L461482	u2574	m167	JEFF	Who said they left then?
L461479	u2574	m167	JEFF	Not yet.
L461478	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Feel a little foolish?
L461477	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
L461476	u2574	m167	JEFF	I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
L461475	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Six ayem.
L461474	u2574	m167	JEFF	What time?
L461473	u2572	m167	DOYLE	-- until yesterday morning.
L461472	u2574	m167	JEFF	Then where is she -- in the ice box?
L461471	u2572	m167	DOYLE	She never left the apartment --
L461470	u2574	m167	JEFF	I think they missed their chance with her.
L461469	u2572	m167	DOYLE	He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
L461464	u2574	m167	JEFF	I was jaywalking.
L461463	u2572	m167	DOYLE	By the way  what happened to your leg?
L461459	u2574	m167	JEFF	Do that.
L461458	u2572	m167	DOYLE	We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
L461457	u2574	m167	JEFF	Thanks.
L461456	u2572	m167	DOYLE	I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
L461455	u2574	m167	JEFF	All right -- you don't believe me.
L461454	u2572	m167	DOYLE	You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
L461453	u2574	m167	JEFF	She -- was -- an -- invalid!
L461452	u2572	m167	DOYLE	His wife took a trip.
L461451	u2574	m167	JEFF	For instance?
L461450	u2572	m167	DOYLE	I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
L461449	u2574	m167	JEFF	You think I made all this up?
L461448	u2572	m167	DOYLE	Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
L461447	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'll bet it's been done.
L461446	u2572	m167	DOYLE	You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
L461445	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well, officer -- do your duty.
L461444	u2572	m167	DOYLE	It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
L461443	u2574	m167	JEFF	Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
L461442	u2572	m167	DOYLE	I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
L461441	u2574	m167	JEFF	Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
L461440	u2572	m167	DOYLE	You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
L461310	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Yeah.
L461309	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
L461308	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
L461307	u2574	m167	JEFF	I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
L461306	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Jeff --
L461305	u2574	m167	JEFF	"The word is ""everything."" Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?"
L461304	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Something wrong?
L461303	u2574	m167	JEFF	It's me.
L461302	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
L461301	u2574	m167	JEFF	Gunnison?
L461300	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Hello.
L461104	u2574	m167	JEFF	Next time, have some good news.
L461103	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
L461102	u2574	m167	JEFF	Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
L461101	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
L461100	u2574	m167	JEFF	Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
L461099	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
L461098	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
L461097	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Like what?
L461096	u2574	m167	JEFF	Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
L461095	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	I'll send you some comic books.
L461094	u2574	m167	JEFF	I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
L461093	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Read some good books.
L461091	u2574	m167	JEFF	You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
L461090	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
L461089	u2574	m167	JEFF	You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
L461088	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
L461087	u2574	m167	JEFF	Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
L461086	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
L461085	u2574	m167	JEFF	Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
L461084	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	With that cast on -- you don't.
L461083	u2574	m167	JEFF	Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
L461082	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	You did.
L461081	u2574	m167	JEFF	Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
L461080	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
L461079	u2574	m167	JEFF	Where?
L461075	u2574	m167	JEFF	Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
L461074	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
L461073	u2574	m167	JEFF	Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
L461072	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Wrong day?
L461071	u2574	m167	JEFF	Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
L461070	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	This is Wednesday.
L461069	u2574	m167	JEFF	Who said I was getting rid of it?
L461068	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	For getting rid of that cast.
L461067	u2574	m167	JEFF	For what?
L461066	u2573	m167	GUNNISON	Congratulations, Jeff.
L461065	u2574	m167	JEFF	Jefferies.
L461885	u2579	m167	THORWALD	Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
L461884	u2574	m167	JEFF	I can't. The police have it by now.
L461883	u2579	m167	THORWALD	Tell her to bring it back!
L461882	u2574	m167	JEFF	No.
L461881	u2579	m167	THORWALD	Can you get me that ring back?
L461798	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
L461797	u2579	m167	THORWALD	I only have a hundred dollars or so.
L461796	u2574	m167	JEFF	Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
L461795	u2579	m167	THORWALD	I don't know what you mean.
L461794	u2574	m167	JEFF	For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
L461793	u2579	m167	THORWALD	Why should I?
L461792	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
L461791	u2579	m167	THORWALD	Who are you?
L461790	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
L461789	u2574	m167	JEFF	Did you get my note?
L461788	u2579	m167	THORWALD	Hello.
L461849	u2578	m167	STELLA	When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
L461848	u2574	m167	JEFF	What about the rest?
L461847	u2578	m167	STELLA	I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
L461846	u2574	m167	JEFF	Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
L461845	u2578	m167	STELLA	Ten here.
L461844	u2574	m167	JEFF	First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
L461843	u2578	m167	STELLA	How much do you think you'll need?
L461842	u2574	m167	JEFF	One hundred and twenty-seven.
L461840	u2574	m167	JEFF	To bail Lisa out of jail.
L461839	u2578	m167	STELLA	What do you need money for?
L461837	u2578	m167	STELLA	Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
L461836	u2574	m167	JEFF	Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
L461835	u2578	m167	STELLA	When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
L461832	u2574	m167	JEFF	That'll get her out of there, won't it?
L461831	u2578	m167	STELLA	Smart? She'll be arrested!
L461830	u2574	m167	JEFF	Smart girl.
L461829	u2578	m167	STELLA	What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
L461778	u2574	m167	JEFF	There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
L461777	u2578	m167	STELLA	You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
L461774	u2574	m167	JEFF	Now wait a minute --
L461773	u2578	m167	STELLA	There's probably one in the basement.
L461772	u2574	m167	JEFF	No.
L461771	u2578	m167	STELLA	Got a shovel?
L461770	u2574	m167	JEFF	What are you two talking about?
L461757	u2574	m167	JEFF	You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
L461756	u2578	m167	STELLA	You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
L461755	u2574	m167	JEFF	Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
L461754	u2578	m167	STELLA	No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
L461753	u2574	m167	JEFF	Would four of them -- ?
L461752	u2578	m167	STELLA	I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
L461751	u2574	m167	JEFF	You can tell that from here?
L461750	u2578	m167	STELLA	Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
L461749	u2574	m167	JEFF	What?
L461748	u2578	m167	STELLA	I wonder.
L461744	u2574	m167	JEFF	I have a feeling we've just begun.
L461743	u2578	m167	STELLA	Thank heaven that's over!
L461742	u2574	m167	JEFF	Look!
L461741	u2578	m167	STELLA	You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
L461726	u2578	m167	STELLA	There's something buried there.
L461725	u2574	m167	JEFF	There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
L461724	u2574	m167	JEFF	And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
L461723	u2578	m167	STELLA	You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
L461717	u2574	m167	JEFF	Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
L461716	u2578	m167	STELLA	Mrs. Thorwald?
L461438	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
L461437	u2578	m167	STELLA	I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
L461429	u2574	m167	JEFF	Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
L461428	u2578	m167	STELLA	You called the police?
L461427	u2574	m167	JEFF	Huh?
L461426	u2578	m167	STELLA	Police?
L461425	u2574	m167	JEFF	Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
L461348	u2574	m167	JEFF	Uh-huh.
L461347	u2578	m167	STELLA	Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
L461346	u2574	m167	JEFF	It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
L461345	u2578	m167	STELLA	I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
L461344	u2574	m167	JEFF	Get back there! He'll see you!
L461343	u2578	m167	STELLA	A Federal offense.
L461339	u2578	m167	STELLA	In this heat?  They're up now.
L461338	u2574	m167	JEFF	No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
L461337	u2578	m167	STELLA	What about this morning? Any developments?
L461336	u2578	m167	STELLA	But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
L461335	u2574	m167	JEFF	Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
L461334	u2578	m167	STELLA	His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
L461333	u2574	m167	JEFF	He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
L461332	u2578	m167	STELLA	Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
L461331	u2574	m167	JEFF	Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
L461330	u2578	m167	STELLA	Isn't he a salesman?
L461329	u2574	m167	JEFF	It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
L461328	u2578	m167	STELLA	He and his wife splitting up?
L461327	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well, the salesman could be available soon.
L461326	u2578	m167	STELLA	Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
L461325	u2574	m167	JEFF	And some man will lose his.
L461324	u2578	m167	STELLA	Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
L461323	u2574	m167	JEFF	Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
L461322	u2578	m167	STELLA	And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
L461321	u2574	m167	JEFF	She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
L461320	u2578	m167	STELLA	Keep your mind off her.
L461318	u2574	m167	JEFF	Depends one which one.
L461317	u2578	m167	STELLA	What'll you do if one of them catches you?
L461316	u2574	m167	JEFF	I was.
L461315	u2578	m167	STELLA	Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
L461314	u2574	m167	JEFF	How did you know!
L461313	u2578	m167	STELLA	The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
L461165	u2574	m167	JEFF	She pay you much?
L461164	u2578	m167	STELLA	Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
L461163	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
L461162	u2578	m167	STELLA	When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
L461161	u2578	m167	STELLA	Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
L461160	u2574	m167	JEFF	People have different emotional levels that --
L461159	u2578	m167	STELLA	Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
L461158	u2574	m167	JEFF	We've progressed emotionally in --
L461157	u2578	m167	STELLA	Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
L461156	u2574	m167	JEFF	There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
L461155	u2578	m167	STELLA	Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
L461154	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's the hard part.
L461153	u2578	m167	STELLA	"I can just hear you now. ""Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"""
L461152	u2574	m167	JEFF	The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
L461151	u2574	m167	JEFF	Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
L461150	u2578	m167	STELLA	You're never going to marry?
L461149	u2574	m167	JEFF	Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
L461148	u2578	m167	STELLA	People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
L461147	u2574	m167	JEFF	It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
L461146	u2578	m167	STELLA	Is what you want something you can discuss?
L461145	u2574	m167	JEFF	Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
L461144	u2578	m167	STELLA	She's only perfect.
L461143	u2574	m167	JEFF	She's just not the girl for me.
L461142	u2578	m167	STELLA	It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
L461141	u2574	m167	JEFF	Stella!
L461140	u2578	m167	STELLA	Her father loading up the shotgun?
L461139	u2574	m167	JEFF	No.
L461138	u2578	m167	STELLA	Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
L461137	u2574	m167	JEFF	She's all right.
L461136	u2578	m167	STELLA	Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
L461135	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'm not ready for marriage.
L461134	u2578	m167	STELLA	That's abnormal.
L461133	u2574	m167	JEFF	I don't want to.
L461132	u2578	m167	STELLA	That's normal.
L461131	u2574	m167	JEFF	She expects me to marry her.
L461130	u2578	m167	STELLA	You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
L461129	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa Fremont.
L461128	u2578	m167	STELLA	Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
L461127	u2574	m167	JEFF	Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
L461126	u2578	m167	STELLA	I knew it!
L461124	u2578	m167	STELLA	Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
L461123	u2574	m167	JEFF	How can you tell that from a thermometer!
L461122	u2578	m167	STELLA	You've got a hormone deficiency.
L461121	u2574	m167	JEFF	Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
L461119	u2578	m167	STELLA	It crashed, didn't it?
L461118	u2574	m167	JEFF	Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
L461116	u2574	m167	JEFF	How?
L461115	u2578	m167	STELLA	I predicted it.
L461111	u2578	m167	STELLA	Well, I only quote from the best.
L461110	u2574	m167	JEFF	Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
L461534	u2574	m167	JEFF	Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
L461533	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	Goodnight, you idiot.
L461532	u2574	m167	JEFF	He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
L461531	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	Who's Thorwald?
L461530	u2574	m167	JEFF	Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
L461529	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
L461528	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'm afraid it is, Tess.
L461527	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	It is something really important, Jeff?
L461526	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	Not a word.
L461525	u2574	m167	JEFF	You haven't even heard from him?
L461524	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	Not yet, Jeff.
L461523	u2574	m167	JEFF	Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
L461522	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	Yes.
L461521	u2574	m167	JEFF	Mrs. Doyle?
L461520	u2576	m167	MRS. DOYLE	Hello.
L461893	u2574	m167	JEFF	Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
L461892	u2575	m167	LISA	Shut up. I'm all right.
L461891	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
L461890	u2575	m167	LISA	Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
L461785	u2575	m167	LISA	Shall we vote him in, Stella?
L461784	u2574	m167	JEFF	"Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word ""we"" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances."
L461783	u2575	m167	LISA	How?
L461782	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
L461780	u2574	m167	JEFF	Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
L461779	u2575	m167	LISA	What for?
L461776	u2574	m167	JEFF	Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
L461775	u2575	m167	LISA	Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
L461767	u2575	m167	LISA	And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
L461766	u2574	m167	JEFF	Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
L461759	u2574	m167	JEFF	Too close.
L461758	u2575	m167	LISA	Wasn't that close?
L461732	u2575	m167	LISA	It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
L461731	u2574	m167	JEFF	Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
L461722	u2574	m167	JEFF	I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
L461721	u2575	m167	LISA	It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
L461720	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well?
L461706	u2574	m167	JEFF	He's washing down the bathroom walls.
L461705	u2575	m167	LISA	Is he cleaning house?
L461704	u2574	m167	JEFF	Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
L461702	u2574	m167	JEFF	In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
L461701	u2575	m167	LISA	But you're not?
L461700	u2574	m167	JEFF	For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
L461695	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
L461694	u2575	m167	LISA	Do you like it?
L461693	u2574	m167	JEFF	Thank you.
L461692	u2575	m167	LISA	I'll rephrase the question.
L461690	u2574	m167	JEFF	No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
L461689	u2575	m167	LISA	Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
L461686	u2574	m167	JEFF	I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
L461685	u2575	m167	LISA	"Whatever happened to that old saying ""Love Thy Neighbor."""
L461683	u2575	m167	LISA	You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
L461682	u2574	m167	JEFF	Huh?
L461681	u2575	m167	LISA	Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
L461680	u2574	m167	JEFF	Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
L461679	u2575	m167	LISA	I'm not much on rear window ethics.
L461678	u2574	m167	JEFF	Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
L461669	u2574	m167	JEFF	Who was the trunk addressed to?
L461668	u2575	m167	LISA	I hate funny exit lines.
L461603	u2575	m167	LISA	Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
L461602	u2574	m167	JEFF	You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
L461601	u2575	m167	LISA	Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
L461600	u2574	m167	JEFF	But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
L461599	u2575	m167	LISA	The same.
L461598	u2574	m167	JEFF	The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
L461597	u2575	m167	LISA	Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
L461596	u2574	m167	JEFF	Staying the night here, uninvited.
L461595	u2575	m167	LISA	I do?
L461594	u2574	m167	JEFF	You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
L461593	u2575	m167	LISA	It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
L461592	u2574	m167	JEFF	From his landlord -- once a month.
L461589	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
L461588	u2575	m167	LISA	I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
L461587	u2575	m167	LISA	A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
L461586	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's a suitcase?
L461585	u2575	m167	LISA	You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
L461583	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
L461582	u2575	m167	LISA	Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
L461581	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
L461580	u2575	m167	LISA	I have the whole weekend off.
L461579	u2574	m167	JEFF	You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
L461578	u2575	m167	LISA	Night. I'm going to stay with you.
L461577	u2574	m167	JEFF	We have all -- what?
L461576	u2575	m167	LISA	Don't rush me. We have all night.
L461575	u2574	m167	JEFF	Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
L461574	u2575	m167	LISA	I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
L461572	u2575	m167	LISA	We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
L461571	u2574	m167	JEFF	Still -- those witnesses.
L461570	u2575	m167	LISA	Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
L461569	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's what the witnesses told him.
L461568	u2575	m167	LISA	That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
L461567	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
L461566	u2575	m167	LISA	Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
L461565	u2574	m167	JEFF	Inside stuff?
L461564	u2575	m167	LISA	They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
L461563	u2574	m167	JEFF	Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
L461562	u2575	m167	LISA	But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
L461561	u2574	m167	JEFF	Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
L461560	u2575	m167	LISA	A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
L461559	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
L461558	u2575	m167	LISA	Women aren't that unpredictable.
L461557	u2574	m167	JEFF	What doesn't?
L461556	u2575	m167	LISA	It doesn't make sense to me.
L461555	u2574	m167	JEFF	Something on your mind, Lisa?
L461554	u2574	m167	JEFF	Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
L461553	u2575	m167	LISA	And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
L461552	u2574	m167	JEFF	Thinking about Thorwald?
L461551	u2575	m167	LISA	All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
L461549	u2574	m167	JEFF	Not yet!
L461548	u2575	m167	LISA	Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
L461547	u2574	m167	JEFF	He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
L461546	u2575	m167	LISA	Suppose he doesn't come back again?
L461545	u2574	m167	JEFF	I don't know.
L461544	u2575	m167	LISA	I wonder where he's going now?
L461543	u2574	m167	JEFF	I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
L461542	u2575	m167	LISA	Someone not his wife?
L461541	u2574	m167	JEFF	He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
L461540	u2575	m167	LISA	What about it?
L461539	u2574	m167	JEFF	That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
L461538	u2574	m167	JEFF	He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
L461537	u2575	m167	LISA	It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
L461419	u2575	m167	LISA	All right -- but what's he doing now?
L461418	u2574	m167	JEFF	To get on home.
L461417	u2575	m167	LISA	Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
L461415	u2575	m167	LISA	125 West Ninth Street.
L461414	u2574	m167	JEFF	What's the apartment house number?
L461413	u2575	m167	LISA	The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
L461410	u2574	m167	JEFF	Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
L461409	u2575	m167	LISA	Don't you see how silly you're being?
L461408	u2574	m167	JEFF	No comment.
L461406	u2575	m167	LISA	And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
L461405	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
L461404	u2575	m167	LISA	Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
L461403	u2574	m167	JEFF	Yeah.
L461402	u2575	m167	LISA	You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
L461401	u2574	m167	JEFF	What are you getting at?
L461400	u2575	m167	LISA	You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
L461399	u2574	m167	JEFF	It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
L461398	u2575	m167	LISA	Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
L461397	u2574	m167	JEFF	There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
L461396	u2575	m167	LISA	There's nothing to see.
L461395	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa, please!
L461394	u2575	m167	LISA	She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
L461393	u2574	m167	JEFF	Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
L461392	u2575	m167	LISA	Maybe she died.
L461391	u2575	m167	LISA	A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
L461390	u2575	m167	LISA	What makes you think something's wrong with her?
L461389	u2574	m167	JEFF	I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
L461388	u2575	m167	LISA	What is it you're looking for?
L461387	u2574	m167	JEFF	You'd better before you catch the disease!
L461386	u2575	m167	LISA	I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
L461385	u2574	m167	JEFF	Do you think I consider this recreation?
L461384	u2575	m167	LISA	Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
L461383	u2574	m167	JEFF	Now, Lisa --
L461382	u2575	m167	LISA	Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
L461375	u2575	m167	LISA	Something too frightful to utter.
L461374	u2574	m167	JEFF	What do you think?
L461372	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
L461371	u2575	m167	LISA	I wouldn't dare answer that.
L461370	u2574	m167	JEFF	Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
L461369	u2575	m167	LISA	Nothing, thank heaven.
L461368	u2574	m167	JEFF	What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
L461367	u2575	m167	LISA	Homework. It's more interesting.
L461366	u2574	m167	JEFF	Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
L461365	u2575	m167	LISA	He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
L461364	u2574	m167	JEFF	Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
L461363	u2575	m167	LISA	Tell me about it.
L461362	u2574	m167	JEFF	So do I.
L461361	u2575	m167	LISA	I have one now.
L461360	u2574	m167	JEFF	Don't you ever have any problems?
L461359	u2575	m167	LISA	Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
L461358	u2574	m167	JEFF	I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
L461297	u2575	m167	LISA	Without any future?
L461296	u2574	m167	JEFF	Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
L461294	u2575	m167	LISA	I mean what I said.
L461293	u2574	m167	JEFF	"You mean ""goodnight."""
L461292	u2575	m167	LISA	Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
L461291	u2574	m167	JEFF	There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
L461290	u2575	m167	LISA	And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
L461288	u2574	m167	JEFF	Right now, it doesn't seem so.
L461287	u2575	m167	LISA	You don't think either one of us could ever change?
L461280	u2574	m167	JEFF	If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
L461279	u2575	m167	LISA	Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
L461278	u2574	m167	JEFF	Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
L461276	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
L461275	u2575	m167	LISA	Three.
L461274	u2574	m167	JEFF	Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
L461273	u2574	m167	JEFF	Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
L461272	u2575	m167	LISA	Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
L461271	u2574	m167	JEFF	You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
L461270	u2575	m167	LISA	Of course not.
L461269	u2574	m167	JEFF	Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
L461268	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa! Shut up!
L461267	u2575	m167	LISA	You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
L461266	u2574	m167	JEFF	Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
L461263	u2575	m167	LISA	It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
L461262	u2574	m167	JEFF	All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
L461261	u2575	m167	LISA	What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
L461260	u2574	m167	JEFF	Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
L461259	u2575	m167	LISA	It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
L461258	u2574	m167	JEFF	There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
L461257	u2575	m167	LISA	If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
L461252	u2574	m167	JEFF	No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
L461251	u2575	m167	LISA	Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
L461250	u2575	m167	LISA	I think it's enchanting.
L461249	u2574	m167	JEFF	Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
L461247	u2575	m167	LISA	You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
L461246	u2574	m167	JEFF	How can you tell that -- from here?
L461245	u2575	m167	LISA	She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
L461244	u2574	m167	JEFF	Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
L461243	u2574	m167	JEFF	Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
L461242	u2575	m167	LISA	Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
L461241	u2574	m167	JEFF	Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
L461240	u2575	m167	LISA	"That's what is know as ""manless melancholia."""
L461238	u2574	m167	JEFF	Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
L461237	u2575	m167	LISA	I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
L461236	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
L461235	u2575	m167	LISA	Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
L461234	u2575	m167	LISA	For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
L461233	u2574	m167	JEFF	For what?
L461232	u2575	m167	LISA	Yes.
L461231	u2574	m167	JEFF	You mean leave the magazine?
L461230	u2575	m167	LISA	Make the one you want.
L461229	u2574	m167	JEFF	I wish there was one I wanted.
L461228	u2575	m167	LISA	Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
L461227	u2574	m167	JEFF	How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
L461226	u2575	m167	LISA	Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
L461225	u2574	m167	JEFF	That's good news.
L461224	u2575	m167	LISA	You can't buy that kind of publicity.
L461222	u2575	m167	LISA	She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
L461221	u2574	m167	JEFF	Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
L461220	u2575	m167	LISA	"Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the ""21"" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change."
L461219	u2574	m167	JEFF	Tired?
L461218	u2575	m167	LISA	What a day I've had!
L461212	u2575	m167	LISA	Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
L461211	u2574	m167	JEFF	Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
L461210	u2575	m167	LISA	I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
L461209	u2574	m167	JEFF	Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
L461208	u2575	m167	LISA	Big enough?
L461198	u2574	m167	JEFF	You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
L461197	u2575	m167	LISA	"What would you think of starting off with dinner at the ""21""?"
L461196	u2575	m167	LISA	I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
L461195	u2574	m167	JEFF	Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
L461194	u2575	m167	LISA	It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
L461193	u2574	m167	JEFF	Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
L461191	u2574	m167	JEFF	Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
L461190	u2575	m167	LISA	It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
L461189	u2574	m167	JEFF	It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
L461188	u2575	m167	LISA	Going on right here. It's a big night.
L461187	u2574	m167	JEFF	Something big going on somewhere?
L461185	u2574	m167	JEFF	Who buys them? Tax collectors?
L461184	u2575	m167	LISA	We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
L461183	u2574	m167	JEFF	That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
L461182	u2575	m167	LISA	-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
L461181	u2574	m167	JEFF	Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
L461179	u2575	m167	LISA	Only because it's expected of her.
L461178	u2574	m167	JEFF	The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
L461174	u2574	m167	JEFF	Uh-huh.
L461173	u2575	m167	LISA	Anything else bothering you?
L461172	u2574	m167	JEFF	Not too active.
L461171	u2575	m167	LISA	And you love life?
L461170	u2574	m167	JEFF	Empty as a football.
L461169	u2575	m167	LISA	And your stomach?
L461168	u2574	m167	JEFF	Mmmm -- hurts a little.
L461167	u2575	m167	LISA	How's your leg?
L461826	u2577	m167	POLICE	Two minutes.
L461825	u2574	m167	JEFF	Chelsea 2-5598.
L461824	u2577	m167	POLICE	Phone number?
L461823	u2574	m167	JEFF	L. B. Jefferies.
L461822	u2577	m167	POLICE	Your name?
L461821	u2574	m167	JEFF	A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L465827	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
L465826	u2608	m170	COP	Yes.
L465825	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
L465824	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
L465823	u2608	m170	COP	Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
L465822	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Thanks, don't mind if I do.
L465821	u2608	m170	COP	I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
L465820	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Now where were we?
L465819	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Alone at last.
L465761	u2609	m170	EDDIE	"You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin ""what the fuck."" And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place."
L465760	u2620	m170	VIC	I don't wanna lift crates.
L465757	u2620	m170	VIC	I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
L465756	u2609	m170	EDDIE	You're coming back to work for us, right?
L465755	u2620	m170	VIC	He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
L465754	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
L465753	u2620	m170	VIC	Seymour Scagnetti.
L465749	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
L465748	u2620	m170	VIC	I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
L465747	u2609	m170	EDDIE	No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
L465746	u2620	m170	VIC	Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
L465745	u2609	m170	EDDIE	You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
L465744	u2620	m170	VIC	You fuckin' wish.
L465737	u2620	m170	VIC	"No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says ""Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up."" And I say ""Well, Joe, I coulda told you that."" ""I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! ""  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself."
L465736	u2609	m170	EDDIE	That I should've picked you up?
L465735	u2620	m170	VIC	Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
L465734	u2609	m170	EDDIE	I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
L465733	u2620	m170	VIC	Fine, now.
L465732	u2609	m170	EDDIE	How ya doin', Toothpick?
L466024	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
L466023	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
L466018	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	How do you know all this?
L466017	u2609	m170	EDDIE	The motherfucker killed Vic.
L465995	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
L465994	u2609	m170	EDDIE	I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
L465949	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Was he all pissed off?
L465948	u2609	m170	EDDIE	I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
L465935	u2609	m170	EDDIE	No. She was from Ladora Heights.
L465934	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Where was she from, Compton?
L465933	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
L465932	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Elois?
L465931	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
L465797	u2609	m170	EDDIE	A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
L465796	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Who?
L465795	u2609	m170	EDDIE	I'll call somebody.
L465794	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You ain't dying, he is.
L465793	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
L465778	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
L465777	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
L466004	u2612	m170	JOE	That's okay, Eddie, I do.
L466003	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
L465768	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
L465767	u2612	m170	JOE	Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
L465766	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
L465763	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
L465762	u2612	m170	JOE	Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
L465759	u2609	m170	EDDIE	This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
L465758	u2612	m170	JOE	We can work this out, can't we?
L465752	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Really? Who's your P.O.?
L465751	u2612	m170	JOE	Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
L465743	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
L465742	u2612	m170	JOE	What?
L465741	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Daddy, did ya see that?
L465997	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
L465996	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
L465942	u2609	m170	EDDIE	"Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him ""Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her."
L465941	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
L465940	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
L465939	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Pam Grier.
L465938	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
L465937	u2609	m170	EDDIE	"It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show ""Get Christie Love""? She was a black female cop. She always used to say ""You're under arrest, sugar."""
L465936	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	"The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  ""Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."""
L465926	u2609	m170	EDDIE	I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
L465925	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
L465818	u2609	m170	EDDIE	There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
L465817	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
L465816	u2609	m170	EDDIE	What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
L465805	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
L465804	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
L465803	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
L465802	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
L465801	u2609	m170	EDDIE	I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
L465799	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
L465798	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
L465788	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
L465787	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I don't know, but somebody did.
L465786	u2609	m170	EDDIE	And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
L465785	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
L465784	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
L465783	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
L465782	u2609	m170	EDDIE	Bullshit.
L465781	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	The cops were there waitin' for us!
L465780	u2609	m170	EDDIE	What? Nobody set anybody up.
L465779	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
L465909	u2610	m170	FREDDY	He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
L465908	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	Tell me more about Cabot.
L465887	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
L465886	u2610	m170	FREDDY	I can do that.
L465885	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
L465884	u2610	m170	FREDDY	I gotta memorize all this shit?
L465883	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
L465882	u2610	m170	FREDDY	What?
L465881	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
L465880	u2610	m170	FREDDY	But what is this?
L465879	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
L465878	u2610	m170	FREDDY	What?
L465877	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	It's a scene. Memorize it.
L465876	u2610	m170	FREDDY	What's this?
L465875	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
L465874	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	Didja use the commode story?
L465872	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
L465871	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
L465870	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
L465869	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
L465868	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	The Milwaukee Brewers?
L465867	u2610	m170	FREDDY	The Brewers.
L465866	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	What about?
L465865	u2610	m170	FREDDY	A little.
L465864	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	Yeah.
L465863	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Me and Mr. White?
L465862	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	Did the two of you talk?
L465861	u2610	m170	FREDDY	The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
L465860	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	How can you tell?
L465859	u2610	m170	FREDDY	No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
L465858	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	Yeah.
L465857	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Who, Mr. White?
L465856	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	You ever seen this motherfucker before?
L465855	u2610	m170	FREDDY	The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
L465854	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	...What bar?
L465853	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
L465848	u2611	m170	HOLDAWAY	This better not be some Freddy joke.
L465847	u2610	m170	FREDDY	"Say ""hello"" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?"
L465985	u2610	m170	FREDDY	I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
L465984	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Just hold on buddy boy.
L465981	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What? Snap out of it!
L465980	u2610	m170	FREDDY	I'm sorry.
L465974	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
L465973	u2610	m170	FREDDY	You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
L465972	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Myself and Mr. Pink?
L465971	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
L465970	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
L465969	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
L465968	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Mr. Brown?
L465967	u2610	m170	FREDDY	I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
L465966	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Let's go over it. Where are you?
L465947	u2610	m170	FREDDY	You can do some crazy things with it.
L465946	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Jesus Christ!
L465892	u2610	m170	FREDDY	Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
L465891	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What for?
L465890	u2610	m170	FREDDY	...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
L465765	u2612	m170	JOE	Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
L465764	u2620	m170	VIC	That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
L465729	u2620	m170	VIC	Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
L465728	u2612	m170	JOE	It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
L465727	u2620	m170	VIC	I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
L465726	u2612	m170	JOE	What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
L465725	u2620	m170	VIC	I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
L465724	u2612	m170	JOE	Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
L465723	u2620	m170	VIC	Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
L465722	u2612	m170	JOE	How is he?
L465721	u2620	m170	VIC	A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
L465720	u2612	m170	JOE	Who's your parole officer?
L465719	u2612	m170	JOE	Take a seat.
L465718	u2620	m170	VIC	Sure.
L465717	u2612	m170	JOE	Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
L465716	u2620	m170	VIC	It's a change.
L465715	u2612	m170	JOE	How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
L465418	u2612	m170	JOE	Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
L465417	u2615	m170	MR. BROWN	Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
L465416	u2612	m170	JOE	Wong?
L465415	u2615	m170	MR. BROWN	"It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, ""Like a Virgin."""
L465414	u2612	m170	JOE	Chew? Toby Chew? No.
L465413	u2615	m170	MR. BROWN	"Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in ""The Great Escape."" He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain."
L465405	u2612	m170	JOE	Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
L465404	u2615	m170	MR. BROWN	Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
L465398	u2615	m170	MR. BROWN	"It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what ""True Blue"" is about, no argument about that."
L465397	u2612	m170	JOE	Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
L466016	u2612	m170	JOE	Dead as Dillinger.
L466015	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Mr. Blue's dead?
L465964	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
L465963	u2612	m170	JOE	Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
L465960	u2612	m170	JOE	You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
L465959	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
L465957	u2612	m170	JOE	I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
L465956	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Why can't we pick out our own colors?
L465955	u2612	m170	JOE	Cause you're a faggot, alright?
L465954	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Why am I Mr. Pink?
L465953	u2612	m170	JOE	But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
L465495	u2612	m170	JOE	Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
L465494	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
L466032	u2612	m170	JOE	I'm not askin', I'm betting.
L466031	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Don't ask me that.
L466030	u2612	m170	JOE	Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
L466029	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
L466028	u2612	m170	JOE	Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
L466026	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
L466025	u2612	m170	JOE	Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
L466021	u2612	m170	JOE	You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
L466020	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That's your proof?
L466019	u2612	m170	JOE	He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
L466014	u2612	m170	JOE	You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
L466013	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
L466012	u2612	m170	JOE	Like hell I am.
L466011	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
L466006	u2612	m170	JOE	That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
L466005	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What the fuck are you talking about?
L465615	u2612	m170	JOE	Juicy, junior, real juicy.
L465614	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What's the cut, poppa?
L465613	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	No, they're not.
L465612	u2612	m170	JOE	Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
L465611	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	How many employees?
L465610	u2612	m170	JOE	Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
L465609	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
L465608	u2612	m170	JOE	What for?
L465607	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
L465606	u2612	m170	JOE	Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
L465605	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
L465604	u2612	m170	JOE	Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
L465603	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
L465602	u2612	m170	JOE	What's she doin' now?
L465450	u2612	m170	JOE	Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
L465449	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Sorry, it's my book now.
L465448	u2612	m170	JOE	I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
L465442	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Who gives a damn?
L465441	u2612	m170	JOE	No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
L465429	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
L465428	u2612	m170	JOE	I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
L465427	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You gonna put it away?
L465426	u2612	m170	JOE	Give me my book.
L465425	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
L465424	u2612	m170	JOE	What do you care?
L465423	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	"For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. ""Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan."" I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left."
L465422	u2612	m170	JOE	Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
L465421	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
L465420	u2612	m170	JOE	What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
L465419	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Give me this fucking thing.
L465407	u2612	m170	JOE	I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
L465406	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What's that?
L466010	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
L466009	u2612	m170	JOE	Aren't you?
L465493	u2612	m170	JOE	Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
L465492	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Nope.
L465491	u2612	m170	JOE	He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
L465490	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	He don't believe in it.
L465489	u2612	m170	JOE	He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
L465488	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	He don't tip.
L465487	u2612	m170	JOE	Mr. Pink?  Why?
L465486	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Mr. Pink.
L465485	u2612	m170	JOE	Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
L465846	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
L465845	u2613	m170	MARVIN	What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
L465844	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
L465843	u2613	m170	MARVIN	That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
L465841	u2613	m170	MARVIN	I do.  How do I look?
L465840	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Shit. I don't remember that at all.
L465839	u2613	m170	MARVIN	Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
L465838	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Freddy Newendyke.
L465837	u2613	m170	MARVIN	Your name's Freddy something.
L465836	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	You do?
L465835	u2613	m170	MARVIN	I know.
L465815	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	I don't like alarms.
L465814	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
L465813	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
L465810	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
L465809	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	"You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming ""You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."""
L465808	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
L465708	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
L465707	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
L465706	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	You didn't ask.
L465705	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
L465702	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Nice Guy Eddie.
L465701	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	For what, the cops?
L465698	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	It's a surprise.
L465697	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Why?
L465696	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Down to my car.
L465695	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Follow you where?
L465686	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	"I said: ""Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."""
L465685	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
L465684	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
L465683	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
L465682	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
L465681	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
L465680	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	What're you talkin' about?
L465679	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
L465678	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	What's this guy's problem?
L465668	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	We think we got a rat in the house.
L465667	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	So, talk.
L465431	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
L465430	u2614	m170	MR. BLONDE	Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
L465993	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
L465992	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
L465988	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
L465987	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What happened?
L465521	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
L465520	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Lie back down, and try to -
L465519	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
L465518	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I can' take you to a hospital.
L465517	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
L465516	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	It's not good...
L465515	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
L465514	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
L465513	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
L465511	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
L465510	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
L465508	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Bet your sweet ass we are.
L465507	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	Joe.
L465506	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
L465505	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Correct.
L465504	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	I'm okay.
L465503	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
L465501	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	No, I'm not!
L465500	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
L465499	u2616	m170	MR. ORANGE	All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
L465498	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
L465471	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
L465470	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
L465466	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
L465465	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	I'd go over twelve percent for that.
L465461	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
L465460	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
L465456	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	You don't believe in tipping?
L465455	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I don't believe in it.
L465454	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
L465453	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Uh-uh. I don't tip.
L465452	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	C'mon, throw in a buck.
L465436	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	"When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy."
L465435	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	"No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? ""Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat,"" by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade."
L465434	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
L465433	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
L465432	u2619	m170	NICE GUY EDDIE	Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
L465962	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	"Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think ""Mr. Pink"" is no big deal, you wanna trade?"
L465961	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
L465930	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Yeah, those guys too.
L465929	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Not these guys.
L465928	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
L465927	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
L465924	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	There's a slight difference.
L465923	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
L465812	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	This is what he was doin'.
L465811	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
L465792	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What are you gonna do about him?
L465791	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I told ya he'd be pissed.
L465693	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
L465692	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You takin' his side?
L465691	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
L465690	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
L465689	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
L465688	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	So you wanna git bit, huh?
L465687	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
L465673	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
L465672	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	We don't think this place is safe.
L465671	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Is that supposed to be funny?
L465666	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
L465665	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
L465655	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
L465654	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
L465651	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That fuckin did it!
L465650	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
L465649	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	If we don't, he'll die.
L465648	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	We ain't taking him to a hospital.
L465647	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
L465646	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
L465645	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Of course.
L465644	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
L465643	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Don't fuckin' patronize me.
L465642	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
L465641	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	"We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, ""Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough.""? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't."
L465640	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	He asked.
L465639	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
L465638	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
L465637	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Why!
L465636	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
L465635	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
L465634	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Well, he knows a little about me.
L465633	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
L465632	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I don't know anybody.
L465631	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
L465630	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
L465629	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
L465628	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
L465627	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	You gotta idea, spit it out.
L465626	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
L465625	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
L465624	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
L465623	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	We can't take him to a hospital.
L465622	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
L465621	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
L465620	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I think he's just passed out.
L465619	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	So what is it?
L465618	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	He ain't dead.
L465617	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	So, is he dead or what?
L465597	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
L465596	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
L465595	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
L465594	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
L465593	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
L465592	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	For all I know, you're the rat.
L465591	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
L465590	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
L465589	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
L465588	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
L465587	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	No shit?
L465586	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
L465585	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	What?
L465584	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
L465583	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
L465582	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That was the plan, we meet here.
L465581	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
L465580	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Where? Are they out in the car?
L465579	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I got 'em, all right?
L465578	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Where?
L465577	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I got the diamonds.
L465576	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	How can you be so sure?
L465575	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Nope.
L465574	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
L465573	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
L465572	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
L465571	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
L465570	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What do you think?
L465569	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
L465568	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
L465567	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
L465566	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
L465565	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
L465564	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
L465563	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
L465562	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
L465561	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
L465560	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Uh-uh, just cops.
L465559	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	No real people?
L465558	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	A few cops.
L465557	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
L465554	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
L465553	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
L465552	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
L465551	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	"Look, enough of this ""Mr White"" shit -"
L465550	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
L465549	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
L465548	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
L465547	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What's wrong with it?
L465546	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	That's not correct.
L465545	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
L465544	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Why not?
L465543	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Want a smoke?
L465541	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
L465540	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	I'm cool.
L465539	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
L465538	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	"What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said ""No thank you"", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!"
L465537	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Let's go in the other room...
L465536	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
L465535	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
L465534	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
L465533	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You really think we were set up?
L465532	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
L465531	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	As opposed to good?
L465530	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
L465529	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
L465528	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
L465527	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Dead.
L465526	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
L465525	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Gun shot.
L465482	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Fuck all that.
L465481	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
L465477	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
L465476	u2618	m170	MR. WHITE	You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
L465475	u2617	m170	MR. PINK	Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
L505798	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't touch him.
L505797	u2743	m179	BO	Daddy.
L505360	u2743	m179	BO	No dad!
L505359	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
L505241	u2743	m179	BO	Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
L505240	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	This one?
L505239	u2743	m179	BO	A hair.
L505238	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	This one?
L505237	u2743	m179	BO	There's dust in it.
L505175	u2743	m179	BO	She doesn't answer me either.
L505174	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505173	u2743	m179	BO	Does she ever answer back?
L505172	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It makes me feel better.
L505171	u2743	m179	BO	Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
L505170	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What are you thinking about?
L505169	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Right.
L505168	u2743	m179	BO	Only for pee or poop.
L505167	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
L505166	u2743	m179	BO	It tastes old.
L505165	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
L505164	u2743	m179	BO	I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
L505163	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's the matter?
L505160	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
L505159	u2743	m179	BO	Houdini's sick.
L505581	u2743	m179	BO	Me too.
L505580	u2748	m179	MORGAN	I'm scared.
L505478	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Who said I was going to die?
L505477	u2743	m179	BO	I don't want you to die.
L505462	u2748	m179	MORGAN	That's weird.
L505461	u2743	m179	BO	The same windows.
L505404	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Dad!
L505403	u2743	m179	BO	My ballet recital.
L505402	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
L505350	u2743	m179	BO	I heard them Morgan.
L505349	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
L505126	u2748	m179	MORGAN	He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
L505125	u2743	m179	BO	It tastes funny.
L505124	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
L505123	u2748	m179	MORGAN	You don't even know what that word means.
L505122	u2743	m179	BO	I think it's contaminated.
L505779	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
L505778	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	And tell Merrill to swing away.
L505777	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
L505776	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm here.
L505775	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	...Tell Graham --
L505774	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	...I will.
L505773	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
L505772	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	...I will.
L505771	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
L505770	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Good.
L505769	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	I don't feel much.
L505768	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Does it hurt?
L505766	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	You love walks.
L505765	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	I was just taking a walk before dinner.
L505764	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Hi baby.
L505763	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	Hi sweetie.
L505307	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
L505306	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Five. The five longest.
L505305	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	You got two minor league home run records don't you?
L505304	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I got the bat at home... On the wall.
L505299	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Clear for what?
L505298	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
L505297	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I see.
L505296	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
L505295	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You do?
L505800	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't.
L505799	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Graham.
L505796	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Graham.
L505795	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't touch him.
L505731	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Me too.
L505730	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That's good enough for me.
L505728	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
L505727	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
L505726	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
L505725	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Have they said anything about our area?
L505724	u2747	m179	MERRILL	He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
L505722	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
L505721	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505719	u2747	m179	MERRILL	A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
L505718	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	How do they know it's over?
L505717	u2747	m179	MERRILL	They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
L505716	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	How many died?
L505714	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
L505713	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They're broadcasting...
L505676	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I'm close.
L505675	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's getting stronger.
L505674	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Me too.
L505673	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I can feel air.
L505664	u2747	m179	MERRILL	From what?
L505663	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They're distracting us?
L505646	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Got it!
L505645	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Merrill!
L505643	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I'm looking!
L505642	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Merrill --
L505633	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
L505632	u2747	m179	MERRILL	We won't be able to get out of there.
L505625	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	"He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, ""No."" He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it."
L505624	u2747	m179	MERRILL	What are you doing?
L505623	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He was only a year and half old.
L505622	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They're right behind the door.
L505621	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Should we make a run for it out the back?
L505620	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
L505618	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We have to go in the basement.
L505617	u2747	m179	MERRILL	This is going to do nothing.
L505608	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
L505607	u2747	m179	MERRILL	They're on the roof.
L505600	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They already know we're here.
L505599	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Should we turn off the lights?
L505578	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
L505577	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Chicken Teriyaki.
L505532	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
L505531	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I'm sorry, what book is this?
L505469	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Ray Reddy's house.
L505468	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Where are you going?
L505438	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
L505437	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
L505436	u2747	m179	MERRILL	They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
L505433	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Eleven a.m. They're gone.
L505432	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What time is it?
L505431	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
L505430	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's furry, furry rabbit?
L505429	u2747	m179	MERRILL	For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
L505423	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What does it matter then?
L505422	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Yes.
L505421	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Do you feel comforted?
L505415	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
L505414	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	That wasn't the answer you wanted?
L505413	u2747	m179	MERRILL	How can you say that?
L505412	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes.
L505411	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Do you think it's a possibility?
L505367	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I got him.
L505366	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Morgan, be careful.
L505352	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That's right.
L505351	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
L505339	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
L505338	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It's noise.
L505326	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
L505325	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Pharmacy crowded?
L505230	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
L505229	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That roof is over ten feet high.
L505228	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
L505227	u2747	m179	MERRILL	This guy got on the roof in like a second.
L505211	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes, it was.
L505210	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It was very dark.
L505201	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes it was.
L505200	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It was very dark.
L505198	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I heard.
L505197	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I cursed.
L505190	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You want him coming in the house next time?
L505189	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No I'm not.
L505188	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Are you going to do this or what?
L505187	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Explain noises.
L505186	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Just make noises then.
L505185	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
L505184	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You don't mean it. It's just for show.
L505183	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm not going to curse.
L505182	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Curse and stuff.
L505181	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Explain, act crazy?
L505179	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
L505178	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
L505803	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yeah baby. I think someone did.
L505802	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Did someone save me?
L505658	u2748	m179	MORGAN	I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
L505657	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I can't even imagine.
L505640	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	You're scaring your sister.
L505639	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They'll read our minds!
L505584	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Don't yell at her!
L505583	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Stop crying!
L505576	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
L505575	u2748	m179	MORGAN	French toast... and mashed potatoes.
L505568	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
L505567	u2748	m179	MORGAN	What about Isabelle?
L505566	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	The family room.
L505565	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Where are we going to sleep?
L505564	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
L505537	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Sounds made up.
L505536	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
L505535	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They win.
L505534	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's two?
L505533	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
L505530	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
L505529	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
L505455	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I just asked his name.
L505454	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Dad.
L505453	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Bimboo?
L505452	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
L505447	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	That means they're unemployed.
L505446	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
L505445	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Who wrote this book?
L505444	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
L505443	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They tell you everything in this book.
L505442	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Oh.
L505441	u2748	m179	MORGAN	So the aliens can't read our minds.
L505365	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
L505364	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Morgan?
L505344	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Don't do it.
L505343	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm getting out now.
L505341	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
L505340	u2748	m179	MORGAN	We might lose the signal.
L505252	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's old Morgan.
L505251	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It's still making the noises. It's broken.
L505225	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I have some upstairs.
L505224	u2748	m179	MORGAN	These are D's; I need double A's.
L505220	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Edgar, come inside.
L505219	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It needs batteries.
L505218	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes.
L505217	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
L505759	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What did you say?
L505758	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
L505757	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Pinned? What does that mean?
L505756	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
L505755	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Why not?
L505754	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	She's not in an ambulance Father.
L505752	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
L505751	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Is he okay?
L505750	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
L505749	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
L505273	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	You take care of yourself...  Graham.
L505272	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
L505271	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
L505270	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	And three weeks.
L505269	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Six months.
L505268	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
L505250	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505249	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Is anything missing?
L505247	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505246	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
L505245	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I don't think so.
L505215	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
L505214	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
L505207	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I would say so.
L505206	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Okay.  So he was tall?
L505205	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He definitely wasn't a midget.
L505204	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
L505203	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
L505202	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
L505151	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
L505150	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Sounds like a virus.
L505149	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
L505148	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What was the first thing?
L505147	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Second thing this week I can't explain.
L505144	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
L505143	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's not broken.
L505141	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	There are none.
L505140	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What about them?
L505139	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	The footprints.
L505138	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	You said something was strange. What's strange?
L505137	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Sorry.
L505136	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
L505135	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	What's that?
L505134	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't call me Father.
L505133	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	It's the strangest thing Father.
L505667	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They'll find a way in.
L505666	u2747	m179	MERRILL	What book!
L505665	u2748	m179	MORGAN	The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
L505558	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Don't worry.
L505557	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
L505552	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They think it might happen all at once.
L505551	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It's like War of the Worlds.
L505550	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
L505362	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You'll lose the signal!
L505361	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Don't do it!
L505328	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Yeah.
L505327	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Is that him?
L509797	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Goodnight, sweetheart.
L509796	u2785	m182	ANNA	Goodnight, Malcolm.
L509793	u2785	m182	ANNA	Tell me.
L509792	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
L509786	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I didn't leave you.
L509785	u2785	m182	ANNA	Why did you leave me?
L509784	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
L509783	u2785	m182	ANNA	Why, Malcolm?
L509324	u2785	m182	ANNA	What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
L509323	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Are you calling me?
L509136	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	--Do I know you?
L509135	u2785	m182	ANNA	--My God.
L509111	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	We can keep it in the bathroom.
L509110	u2785	m182	ANNA	Wow. They called you their son.
L509108	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
L509107	u2785	m182	ANNA	Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
L509106	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
L509105	u2785	m182	ANNA	Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
L509333	u2790	m182	MAN'S VOICE	Thanks.
L509332	u2785	m182	ANNA	Don't step in the horse manure.
L509331	u2790	m182	MAN'S VOICE	Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
L509330	u2785	m182	ANNA	You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
L509329	u2790	m182	MAN'S VOICE	Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
L509328	u2785	m182	ANNA	That's very sweet. I'm okay.
L509326	u2785	m182	ANNA	I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
L509325	u2790	m182	MAN'S VOICE	On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
L509723	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
L509722	u2786	m182	COLE	What?
L509721	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	And you know what else?
L509720	u2786	m182	COLE	Really?
L509719	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	You were great in the play, Cole.
L509717	u2786	m182	COLE	Maybe.
L509716	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
L509679	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I definitely won't.
L509678	u2786	m182	COLE	Don't go home, okay?
L509677	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Where will you go, where no one has died?
L509676	u2786	m182	COLE	I wish I were somewhere else.
L509669	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I guess she did.
L509668	u2786	m182	COLE	She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
L509654	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
L509653	u2786	m182	COLE	What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
L509651	u2786	m182	COLE	You do?
L509650	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
L509649	u2786	m182	COLE	You believe now?
L509648	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
L509647	u2786	m182	COLE	Just help.
L509646	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
L509645	u2786	m182	COLE	No.
L509644	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
L509643	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
L509642	u2786	m182	COLE	You have nice red in your cheeks now.
L509641	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
L509640	u2786	m182	COLE	You really look better.
L509638	u2786	m182	COLE	What happened?
L509637	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	No, we're not.
L509636	u2786	m182	COLE	We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
L509635	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yes, I am.
L509634	u2786	m182	COLE	Are you wigging out?
L509633	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yes, it did.
L509632	u2786	m182	COLE	Something happened, didn't it?
L509604	u2786	m182	COLE	You believe me, right?
L509603	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yes.
L509602	u2786	m182	COLE	Dr. Crowe?
L509601	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
L509600	u2786	m182	COLE	You weren't a paper champion.
L509599	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
L509598	u2786	m182	COLE	Don't cry.
L509596	u2786	m182	COLE	Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
L509595	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	--What?
L509594	u2786	m182	COLE	Don't fail me.
L509593	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
L509592	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Soon. One week.
L509591	u2786	m182	COLE	When?
L509590	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I have to.
L509585	u2786	m182	COLE	Why don't you think about it for a while?
L509584	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I don't know, Cole.
L509583	u2786	m182	COLE	I told you what I want.
L509582	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I don't know.
L509581	u2786	m182	COLE	What do you want more than anything?
L509580	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yes.
L509579	u2786	m182	COLE	Can I ask you then?
L509510	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Them?
L509509	u2786	m182	COLE	When they get mad, it gets cold.
L509507	u2786	m182	COLE	And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
L509506	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yes?
L509497	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Never mind.
L509496	u2786	m182	COLE	Cats?
L509495	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
L509494	u2786	m182	COLE	Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
L509493	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What?
L509492	u2786	m182	COLE	Did you think the play sucked big time?
L509479	u2786	m182	COLE	Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
L509478	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	...No.
L509477	u2786	m182	COLE	All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
L509476	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	How often do you see them?
L509473	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	They don't know they're dead?
L509472	u2786	m182	COLE	No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
L509471	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
L509464	u2786	m182	COLE	Me too.
L509463	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
L509459	u2786	m182	COLE	Your eyes told me.
L509458	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What makes you think that?
L509455	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	No gas... Hey, that's good.
L509454	u2786	m182	COLE	You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
L509453	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	No.
L509452	u2786	m182	COLE	You haven't told bedtime stories before?
L509451	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yes.
L509450	u2786	m182	COLE	Dr. Crowe.
L509449	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
L509448	u2786	m182	COLE	Yes.
L509447	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
L509380	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I forgot myself.
L509379	u2786	m182	COLE	I didn't know you were funny.
L509378	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Who me?
L509377	u2786	m182	COLE	You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
L509376	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What?
L509375	u2786	m182	COLE	That isn't magic.
L509319	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
L509318	u2786	m182	COLE	Something I want?
L509317	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
L509313	u2786	m182	COLE	Upset words.
L509312	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What kind of words?
L509311	u2786	m182	COLE	Words.
L509310	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What'd you write?
L509303	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
L509302	u2786	m182	COLE	What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
L509301	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
L509286	u2786	m182	COLE	She died a long time ago.
L509285	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What about Mrs. Marschal?
L509284	u2786	m182	COLE	Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
L509273	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Yeah. Sorry.
L509272	u2786	m182	COLE	"You said the ""s"" word."
L509270	u2786	m182	COLE	That I'm a freak.
L509269	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Know what?
L509268	u2786	m182	COLE	Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
L509267	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Why?
L509266	u2786	m182	COLE	I don't tell her a thing.
L509265	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
L509263	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	You hate him?
L509262	u2786	m182	COLE	He hates me.
L509261	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	He your best buddy?
L509260	u2786	m182	COLE	I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
L509255	u2786	m182	COLE	Look over there.
L509254	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Where should I look then, Cole?
L509250	u2786	m182	COLE	Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
L509249	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	You mean aneurysm.
L509248	u2786	m182	COLE	Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
L509245	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
L509244	u2786	m182	COLE	You want to ask me a question?
L509231	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I guess they don't.
L509230	u2786	m182	COLE	I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
L509229	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	How do you draw now?
L509228	u2786	m182	COLE	Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
L509227	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	You saw that on T.V., Cole?
L509226	u2786	m182	COLE	We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
L509187	u2786	m182	COLE	Next time I won't be scared of you.
L509186	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
L509184	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	If it's okay with you?
L509183	u2786	m182	COLE	I'm going to see you again, right?
L509182	u2786	m182	COLE	That's good.
L509181	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	No.
L509180	u2786	m182	COLE	Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
L509179	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	No.
L509178	u2786	m182	COLE	You use needles?
L509177	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
L509176	u2786	m182	COLE	Congratulations.
L509175	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I got an award once. From the Mayor.
L509173	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
L509172	u2786	m182	COLE	You're a doctor. What kind?
L509171	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Dr. Crowe.
L509170	u2786	m182	COLE	I forgot your name.
L509168	u2786	m182	COLE	Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
L509167	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
L509166	u2786	m182	COLE	What were they hiding from?
L509164	u2786	m182	COLE	No, just one.
L509163	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	All your soldiers speak Latin?
L509161	u2786	m182	COLE	...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
L509160	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
L509159	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	I knew there was a sound explanation.
L509158	u2786	m182	COLE	They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
L509157	u2789	m182	MALCOLM	Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
L509772	u2786	m182	COLE	She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
L509771	u2788	m182	LYNN	Cole, please stop.
L509770	u2786	m182	COLE	She wanted me to tell you--
L509769	u2786	m182	COLE	I know.
L509768	u2788	m182	LYNN	Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
L509767	u2786	m182	COLE	Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
L509766	u2788	m182	LYNN	What?
L509765	u2786	m182	COLE	She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
L509762	u2786	m182	COLE	Got it.
L509761	u2788	m182	LYNN	I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
L509759	u2786	m182	COLE	You think I'm a freak?
L509758	u2788	m182	LYNN	...I don't know.
L509757	u2786	m182	COLE	What are you thinking, Momma?
L509755	u2788	m182	LYNN	They talk to you?
L509754	u2786	m182	COLE	They want me to do things for them.
L509753	u2788	m182	LYNN	You see ghosts, Cole?
L509752	u2786	m182	COLE	Ghosts.
L509751	u2788	m182	LYNN	Dead people?
L509750	u2786	m182	COLE	Dead people.
L509749	u2788	m182	LYNN	They?
L509748	u2786	m182	COLE	They scare me too sometimes.
L509747	u2788	m182	LYNN	Cole, you're scaring me.
L509745	u2786	m182	COLE	Standing next to my window.
L509744	u2788	m182	LYNN	Where is she?
L509743	u2786	m182	COLE	Yes.
L509742	u2788	m182	LYNN	You can see her?
L509741	u2788	m182	LYNN	Oh my God.
L509740	u2786	m182	COLE	A lady. She died.
L509739	u2788	m182	LYNN	They did?
L509738	u2786	m182	COLE	Someone got hurt.
L509737	u2788	m182	LYNN	Yeah.
L509736	u2786	m182	COLE	You know that accident up there?
L509734	u2786	m182	COLE	Tell you my secrets.
L509733	u2788	m182	LYNN	Communicate?
L509732	u2786	m182	COLE	I'm ready to communicate with you now.
L509731	u2788	m182	LYNN	I'd give anything to have been there.
L509536	u2786	m182	COLE	Maybe.
L509535	u2788	m182	LYNN	There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
L509534	u2788	m182	LYNN	So who moved it?
L509533	u2786	m182	COLE	Don't get mad.
L509532	u2788	m182	LYNN	You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
L509531	u2788	m182	LYNN	Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
L509530	u2786	m182	COLE	Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
L509529	u2788	m182	LYNN	That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
L509528	u2786	m182	COLE	You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
L509527	u2788	m182	LYNN	It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
L509199	u2786	m182	COLE	Anything bad about me?
L509198	u2788	m182	LYNN	Lots of things.
L509197	u2786	m182	COLE	What are you thinking, Momma?
L509196	u2786	m182	COLE	Oh.
L509195	u2788	m182	LYNN	They're right here.
L509365	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
L509364	u2786	m182	COLE	Stuttering--
L509363	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	S-ssssstop it!
L509362	u2786	m182	COLE	Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
L509361	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	S-ssstop that!
L509360	u2786	m182	COLE	Stuttering Stanley!
L509359	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	Who!
L509358	u2786	m182	COLE	Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
L509356	u2786	m182	COLE	Stop looking at me.
L509355	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	How did you--?
L509354	u2786	m182	COLE	You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
L509353	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	What--
L509352	u2786	m182	COLE	You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
L509351	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	Excuse me?
L509350	u2786	m182	COLE	You're a stuttering Stanley!
L509349	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	I don't know how else to look--
L509348	u2786	m182	COLE	Stop it!
L509347	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	Like what?
L509346	u2786	m182	COLE	I don't like people looking at me like that.
L509344	u2786	m182	COLE	They were the ones who hanged everybody.
L509343	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
L509342	u2786	m182	COLE	They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
L509341	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
L509340	u2786	m182	COLE	They used to hang people here.
L509339	u2791	m182	MR. CUNNINGHAM	Yes, Cole?
L509408	u2788	m182	LYNN	I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
L509407	u2787	m182	DARREN'S MOM	Good for you.
L509406	u2787	m182	DARREN'S MOM	J. C. Penny's?
L509405	u2788	m182	LYNN	I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
L509403	u2788	m182	LYNN	Cheese. It's a kid's place.
L509402	u2787	m182	DARREN'S MOM	Chuck E. who?
L509401	u2788	m182	LYNN	The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
L509400	u2787	m182	DARREN'S MOM	It's our pleasure.
L509399	u2788	m182	LYNN	...He doesn't get invited places.
L518527	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
L518526	u2847	m187	KELVIN	A puppet.
L518525	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	No?  Who am I, then?
L518524	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You're not Gibarian...
L518523	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	You'll end up like me.
L518522	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I can trust Rheya.
L518521	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
L518520	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
L518519	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Can it work?
L518518	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
L518517	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What do you want?
L518516	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
L518514	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	Leave the light off.
L518513	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian.
L518668	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Yes.
L518667	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
L518666	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
L518665	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How quickly?
L518664	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
L518663	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Whose side are you on?
L518662	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You fucking bastard...
L518661	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
L518660	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Why would you let her to do that?
L518659	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	No, she won't.
L518658	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She'll come back.
L518657	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
L518656	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You murdered her!
L518655	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Not her.  It.
L518654	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You killed her!
L518476	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Why did you agree to come here?
L518475	u2847	m187	KELVIN	That's fantastic.
L518474	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Yes.
L518473	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
L518375	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	She reappeared exactly as she had before?
L518374	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.  There's no behavior modification.
L518236	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
L518235	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Listen --
L518234	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
L518233	u2847	m187	KELVIN	They shouldn't let people like you into space.
L518231	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Her?  Who are you talking about?
L518230	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	In the lab.  With her, probably.
L518229	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where's his body?
L518228	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	The same thing that could happen to any of us.
L518227	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
L518226	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
L518225	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want to hear your version.
L518224	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Didn't you talk to Snow?
L518223	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What happened to Gibarian?
L518222	u2847	m187	KELVIN	All right.
L518221	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
L518681	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Maybe you can.
L518680	u2850	m187	SNOW	But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
L518679	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Jesus...
L518678	u2850	m187	SNOW	Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
L518677	u2847	m187	KELVIN	When did this happen?
L518672	u2850	m187	SNOW	I won't be making the trip.
L518671	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
L518624	u2850	m187	SNOW	You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
L518623	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I love her.
L518622	u2850	m187	SNOW	You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
L518621	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Into what?
L518620	u2850	m187	SNOW	Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
L518619	u2850	m187	SNOW	Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
L518618	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Her oxygen would have run out.
L518617	u2850	m187	SNOW	Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
L518616	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.
L518615	u2850	m187	SNOW	What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
L518614	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Just get him to stop.
L518613	u2850	m187	SNOW	What plan?
L518612	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
L518611	u2850	m187	SNOW	What do you want?
L518610	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.
L518609	u2850	m187	SNOW	She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
L518608	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
L518549	u2850	m187	SNOW	Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
L518548	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Get out --
L518547	u2850	m187	SNOW	Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
L518544	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She drank liquid oxygen.
L518543	u2850	m187	SNOW	What happened?
L518501	u2850	m187	SNOW	That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
L518500	u2847	m187	KELVIN	They come when you sleep.
L518499	u2850	m187	SNOW	But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
L518498	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Human beings can die.
L518497	u2850	m187	SNOW	Perhaps it did.
L518496	u2847	m187	KELVIN	But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
L518495	u2850	m187	SNOW	Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
L518494	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
L518493	u2850	m187	SNOW	Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
L518492	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.
L518491	u2850	m187	SNOW	We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
L518418	u2850	m187	SNOW	Who are you trying to convince?
L518417	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
L518416	u2850	m187	SNOW	Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
L518415	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Not necessarily.
L518414	u2850	m187	SNOW	If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
L518413	u2847	m187	KELVIN	-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
L518412	u2850	m187	SNOW	You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
L518383	u2847	m187	KELVIN	When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
L518382	u2850	m187	SNOW	I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
L518381	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
L518354	u2850	m187	SNOW	Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
L518353	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Why?
L518352	u2850	m187	SNOW	Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
L518351	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What is it?
L518350	u2850	m187	SNOW	Kelvin, you awake?
L518296	u2850	m187	SNOW	That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
L518295	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
L518294	u2850	m187	SNOW	An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
L518293	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't know.
L518292	u2850	m187	SNOW	What are you going to report back to Earth?
L518291	u2847	m187	KELVIN	To who?
L518290	u2850	m187	SNOW	What will you say?
L518289	u2850	m187	SNOW	Told you what?
L518288	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I wish you'd told me.
L518287	u2850	m187	SNOW	Probably.
L518286	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Will she come back?
L518285	u2850	m187	SNOW	It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
L518284	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya.
L518283	u2850	m187	SNOW	She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
L518282	u2850	m187	SNOW	Dead?
L518281	u2847	m187	KELVIN	My wife.
L518280	u2850	m187	SNOW	I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
L518279	u2847	m187	KELVIN	And professionally?
L518278	u2850	m187	SNOW	Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
L518277	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What was it?
L518276	u2850	m187	SNOW	I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
L518275	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Shut up.
L518274	u2850	m187	SNOW	Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
L518249	u2850	m187	SNOW	Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
L518248	u2847	m187	KELVIN	That depends.
L518247	u2850	m187	SNOW	How long can you go without sleep?
L518246	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How much sleep?
L518245	u2850	m187	SNOW	How much sleep do you need?
L518243	u2850	m187	SNOW	Oh, that's a relief.
L518242	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
L518241	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She was real.  Where did she come from?
L518240	u2850	m187	SNOW	Who was it?
L518239	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
L518238	u2850	m187	SNOW	Why, who did you see?
L518237	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Is there anybody else here?
L518218	u2850	m187	SNOW	Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
L518217	u2847	m187	KELVIN	He'll let me in.
L518216	u2850	m187	SNOW	In his lab.  He won't let you in.
L518215	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where's Sartorius?
L518214	u2850	m187	SNOW	I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
L518212	u2850	m187	SNOW	I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
L518211	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What?
L518210	u2850	m187	SNOW	You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
L518208	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How?
L518207	u2850	m187	SNOW	He's dead.
L518206	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
L518690	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
L518689	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How can you be here...
L518640	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You must have been dreaming.
L518639	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
L518638	u2848	m187	RHEYA	When?
L518637	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where did you go before?
L518634	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Please.  Don't.
L518633	u2848	m187	RHEYA	"I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have ""an arrangement"".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?"
L518629	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
L518628	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What does it want?
L518627	u2847	m187	KELVIN	A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
L518626	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What are you taking?
L518606	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
L518605	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Am I really her?
L518604	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
L518603	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I can't --
L518602	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
L518601	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
L518600	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I think they help.
L518599	u2848	m187	RHEYA	They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
L518598	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I wish you wouldn't.
L518597	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I want to stop taking those pills.
L518596	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Is that really what you want?
L518595	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But then I would be dead now.
L518594	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
L518593	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
L518592	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes, you are --
L518591	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
L518590	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Who are you, then?
L518589	u2848	m187	RHEYA	That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
L518588	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You exist here.  I keep telling you.
L518587	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You're lying.
L518586	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want you here.
L518585	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What do I have to do to stop it?
L518579	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Then you won't make it.
L518578	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
L518577	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I can't stay here.
L518576	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Chris --
L518575	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I never said I didn't.
L518574	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You never said you wanted one.
L518573	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Neither did I.
L518572	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
L518571	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Thank you.
L518570	u2848	m187	RHEYA	It wouldn't have made any difference.
L518569	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You should have told me.
L518568	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
L518562	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want every second I can get with you.
L518561	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Then you'll die.
L518560	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
L518559	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You're lying.  I'm not human.
L518558	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.
L518557	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm disgusting.
L518556	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
L518555	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't call me that.
L518554	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya --
L518553	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
L518542	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
L518541	u2848	m187	RHEYA	How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
L518540	u2848	m187	RHEYA	"How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no ""You"" from before."
L518539	u2847	m187	KELVIN	That won't happen again.  We're different.
L518538	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
L518537	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I love you.
L518536	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
L518535	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's all right.
L518534	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What's happening to us?
L518531	u2847	m187	KELVIN	He is.  But he was here...
L518530	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You said he was dead.
L518529	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian.  He was here.
L518528	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What's wrong?
L518512	u2848	m187	RHEYA	If you're here.
L518511	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Do you?
L518510	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Do you want to stay here?
L518509	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Not this time.
L518508	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But that's what happened before.
L518507	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
L518506	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
L518505	u2847	m187	KELVIN	For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
L518504	u2848	m187	RHEYA	That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
L518503	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya.
L518502	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You don't want me.
L518481	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
L518480	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
L518479	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You're the coward.
L518470	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Those are dreams.
L518469	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
L518468	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Can you sleep?
L518467	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I love you, too.
L518466	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.  I love you.
L518465	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Was she right?
L518464	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You... she said I didn't love her.
L518463	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Why did she do it?
L518462	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.  Especially toward the end.
L518461	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But we fought.
L518458	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
L518457	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
L518456	u2847	m187	KELVIN	When?  When I'm asleep?
L518455	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Sartorius.
L518454	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Who have you been talking to?
L518453	u2848	m187	RHEYA	That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
L518452	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What are you talking about?
L518449	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Stop.
L518448	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You don't love me.
L518447	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What's wrong.
L518443	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm glad.
L518442	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.  Yes.
L518441	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Do I really feel like... I am...?
L518440	u2848	m187	RHEYA	It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
L518439	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
L518438	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
L518437	u2847	m187	KELVIN	He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
L518436	u2848	m187	RHEYA	He has a point.
L518435	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
L518434	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Sartorius wants to destroy it.
L518433	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
L518432	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What does Snow think you should do?
L518430	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
L518429	u2848	m187	RHEYA	"You sure say ""God"" a lot when we're doing it."
L518426	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
L518425	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
L518424	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I like that too.
L518423	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
L518422	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I think so.
L518421	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
L518411	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
L518410	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
L518407	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
L518406	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Why did you say those things?
L518402	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You don't know?
L518401	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What happened to us, exactly?
L518398	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I did too.
L518397	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
L518395	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
L518394	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
L518393	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What kind of look?
L518392	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
L518391	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How old were you?
L518390	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
L518388	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I been thinking about how much I hate you.
L518387	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where've you been?
L518359	u2848	m187	RHEYA	When I saw you were gone I got scared.
L518358	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
L518357	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What happened?
L518348	u2848	m187	RHEYA	As I said, then it's God, right?
L518347	u2847	m187	KELVIN	As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
L518346	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
L518345	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
L518344	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
L518343	u2847	m187	KELVIN	The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
L518342	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You still don't believe in God?
L518341	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's something.
L518340	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Then it's God, right?
L518339	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
L518338	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Is it intelligent?
L518337	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
L518336	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Is it a planet?
L518335	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
L518334	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
L518333	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What do you mean?
L518332	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What do you remember?
L518330	u2847	m187	KELVIN	All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
L518329	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
L518328	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You're better when you take them.
L518326	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You talk like an actor.
L518325	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
L518324	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You go home.
L518323	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Let's go home.
L518322	u2848	m187	RHEYA	And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
L518321	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya.  Not here.
L518320	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You behave as though you want to fuck her.
L518319	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Stop it.
L518318	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You want to fuck her?
L518316	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Better.
L518315	u2847	m187	KELVIN	And tonight?
L518314	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I wasn't.
L518313	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You didn't look very happy.
L518312	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Not a very happy poem.
L518311	u2848	m187	RHEYA	My Thomas is a little rusty.
L518310	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
L518309	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Book?
L518308	u2847	m187	KELVIN	And Death Shall Have No Dominion.
L518307	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I want you inside me right now.
L518306	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya...
L518272	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.
L518271	u2848	m187	RHEYA	We're taking a flight?
L518270	u2848	m187	RHEYA	To calm my anxiety.
L518269	u2847	m187	KELVIN	To calm your anxiety.
L518268	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What are they?
L518266	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I'll be right back.
L518265	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I don't know.  I can't be alone.
L518264	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Why?
L518263	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't.
L518262	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I'll just be a minute.
L518261	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'll go with you.
L518260	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I need to see Snow.
L518253	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Yes.
L518252	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Oh, God.  I'm awake.
L518683	u2850	m187	SNOW	You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
L518682	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	You want it coming back with us?
L518676	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Fuck me.  I knew it.
L518675	u2850	m187	SNOW	I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
L518674	u2850	m187	SNOW	I'm not Snow.
L518673	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Snow, get up here, now.
L518472	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
L518471	u2850	m187	SNOW	Gibarian was under enormous --
L518380	u2850	m187	SNOW	Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
L518379	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Followed by non-human manifestations.
L518378	u2850	m187	SNOW	And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
L518377	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
L518373	u2850	m187	SNOW	It's an experiment.
L518372	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
L518368	u2850	m187	SNOW	We want to talk freely.
L518367	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
L518365	u2850	m187	SNOW	He won't.
L518364	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Why do you say that?
L518363	u2850	m187	SNOW	He won't do it.
L545913	u2897	m191	B'ETOR	Full disruptors.
L545912	u2905	m191	LURSA	Target their Bridge.
L545882	u2897	m191	B'ETOR	I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
L545881	u2905	m191	LURSA	Where is he now?
L545872	u2897	m191	B'ETOR	Then when is he going to Engineering?
L545871	u2905	m191	LURSA	He is.
L545870	u2897	m191	B'ETOR	I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
L545860	u2897	m191	B'ETOR	Where is he?
L545859	u2905	m191	LURSA	It's working.
L545849	u2905	m191	LURSA	We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
L545848	u2897	m191	B'ETOR	The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
L545692	u2905	m191	LURSA	HoS qorDu. 
L545691	u2897	m191	B'ETOR	Toh-pak-cha=8A 
L545378	u2903	m191	KIRK	Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
L545377	u2898	m191	CHEKOV	Twelve years, sir.
L545376	u2903	m191	KIRK	But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
L545358	u2903	m191	KIRK	I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
L545357	u2898	m191	CHEKOV	Captain=8A
L545353	u2898	m191	CHEKOV	Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
L545352	u2903	m191	KIRK	Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
L545349	u2903	m191	KIRK	Thanks for pointing that out.
L545348	u2898	m191	CHEKOV	Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
L545833	u2906	m191	PICARD	I have to find a way to get to Soran.
L545832	u2899	m191	DATA	Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
L545828	u2899	m191	DATA	Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
L545827	u2906	m191	PICARD	Commander.
L545826	u2899	m191	DATA	Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-
L545802	u2899	m191	DATA	Approximately two hundred thirty million.
L545801	u2906	m191	PICARD	Population?
L545800	u2899	m191	DATA	Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
L545799	u2906	m191	PICARD	Are any of them inhabited?
L545798	u2906	m191	PICARD	And destroy every planet in the system.
L545797	u2899	m191	DATA	It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
L545796	u2906	m191	PICARD	That's where he's going.
L545793	u2899	m191	DATA	Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
L545792	u2906	m191	PICARD	He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
L545789	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe so.
L545788	u2906	m191	PICARD	Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
L545785	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe so.
L545784	u2906	m191	PICARD	Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
L545781	u2906	m191	PICARD	Can you project its course?
L545780	u2899	m191	DATA	This is its current position.
L545778	u2899	m191	DATA	The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
L545777	u2906	m191	PICARD	Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
L545776	u2899	m191	DATA	According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
L545775	u2899	m191	DATA	Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
L545774	u2906	m191	PICARD	No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
L545773	u2899	m191	DATA	But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
L545772	u2906	m191	PICARD	Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
L545771	u2899	m191	DATA	I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
L545770	u2906	m191	PICARD	What do you mean?
L545769	u2899	m191	DATA	No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
L545768	u2906	m191	PICARD	Data, are you all right?
L545767	u2899	m191	DATA	It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
L545766	u2906	m191	PICARD	Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
L545765	u2899	m191	DATA	The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
L545764	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
L545763	u2899	m191	DATA	Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
L545762	u2906	m191	PICARD	Data?
L545761	u2906	m191	PICARD	When is it expected back?
L545760	u2899	m191	DATA	According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
L545926	u2899	m191	DATA	One minute to warp core breach.
L545925	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
L545639	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
L545638	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
L545637	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Data, are you all right?
L545635	u2899	m191	DATA	I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
L545634	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Data, this isn't the time.
L545625	u2899	m191	DATA	It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
L545624	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
L545621	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Thanks.
L545620	u2899	m191	DATA	I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
L545619	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
L545618	u2899	m191	DATA	During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
L545617	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	What?
L545615	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	You get what?
L545614	u2899	m191	DATA	I get it. I get it.
L545589	u2899	m191	DATA	I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
L545588	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Really? What do you feel?
L545587	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
L545586	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Well?
L545572	u2899	m191	DATA	Agreed.
L545571	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
L545569	u2899	m191	DATA	"That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more ""human""- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer."
L545568	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
L545567	u2899	m191	DATA	It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
L545566	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
L545565	u2899	m191	DATA	I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
L545564	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
L545563	u2899	m191	DATA	Is she still angry?
L545934	u2907	m191	RIKER	All hands, brace for impact!
L545933	u2899	m191	DATA	I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
L545903	u2899	m191	DATA	Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
L545902	u2907	m191	RIKER	Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
L545716	u2899	m191	DATA	I hope so, sir.
L545715	u2907	m191	RIKER	We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
L545714	u2899	m191	DATA	I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
L545713	u2907	m191	RIKER	Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
L545544	u2907	m191	RIKER	The station complement was nineteen.
L545543	u2899	m191	DATA	Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
L545488	u2900	m191	DEMORA	There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
L545487	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
L545475	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	I'll go. You have the Bridge.
L545474	u2900	m191	DEMORA	Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
L545433	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Beam them directly to Sickbay.
L545432	u2900	m191	DEMORA	We're within range, sir.
L545407	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	On screen.
L545406	u2900	m191	DEMORA	We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
L545402	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
L545401	u2900	m191	DEMORA	The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
L545400	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Can you locate them?
L545984	u2901	m191	GUINAN	I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
L545983	u2906	m191	PICARD	You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
L545982	u2901	m191	GUINAN	What makes you think things will be any different this time?
L545981	u2906	m191	PICARD	I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
L545980	u2901	m191	GUINAN	I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
L545979	u2906	m191	PICARD	I don't understand.
L545978	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Yes, where would you go?
L545977	u2906	m191	PICARD	Can I?
L545976	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Why would you want to leave?
L545975	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
L545971	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
L545970	u2906	m191	PICARD	These are my children...my children.
L545967	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Wherever he wanted to be.
L545966	u2906	m191	PICARD	Where is he now?
L545965	u2901	m191	GUINAN	All of us.
L545964	u2906	m191	PICARD	Soran?
L545963	u2901	m191	GUINAN	When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
L545962	u2906	m191	PICARD	Left behind?
L545961	u2901	m191	GUINAN	"I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an ""echo"" of the person you know. A part she left behind."
L545960	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
L545959	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
L545958	u2906	m191	PICARD	But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
L545957	u2901	m191	GUINAN	For you. This is where you wanted to be.
L545956	u2906	m191	PICARD	This is the Nexus?
L545955	u2901	m191	GUINAN	You're in the Nexus.
L545954	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
L545737	u2906	m191	PICARD	But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
L545736	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
L545735	u2906	m191	PICARD	"Your ""sixth sense""- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?"
L545734	u2901	m191	GUINAN	It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
L545730	u2901	m191	GUINAN	I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
L545729	u2906	m191	PICARD	What happened to you?
L545728	u2901	m191	GUINAN	That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
L545726	u2906	m191	PICARD	"What's the ""Nexus""?"
L545725	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
L545724	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
L545723	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
L545722	u2906	m191	PICARD	Do you remember him?
L545429	u2903	m191	KIRK	Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
L545428	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
L545416	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
L545415	u2903	m191	KIRK	You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
L545414	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	We don't have a tractor beam.
L545391	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Please, I insist.
L545390	u2903	m191	KIRK	No, no. Thank you.
L545389	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
L545388	u2903	m191	KIRK	Oh, of course.
L545387	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
L545365	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Please, please.
L545364	u2903	m191	KIRK	Well, may we have a look around?
L545362	u2903	m191	KIRK	It's our pleasure.
L545361	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
L546053	u2903	m191	KIRK	Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
L546052	u2906	m191	PICARD	Yes.  Thank you.
L546051	u2903	m191	KIRK	Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
L546050	u2906	m191	PICARD	I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
L546042	u2903	m191	KIRK	Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
L546041	u2906	m191	PICARD	You could say that.
L546040	u2903	m191	KIRK	I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
L546039	u2906	m191	PICARD	That's right.
L546038	u2903	m191	KIRK	How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
L546035	u2906	m191	PICARD	I hadn't planned on it.
L546034	u2903	m191	KIRK	Close to retirement?
L546033	u2906	m191	PICARD	That's right.
L546032	u2903	m191	KIRK	Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
L546030	u2903	m191	KIRK	She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
L546029	u2906	m191	PICARD	Antonia?
L546024	u2903	m191	KIRK	This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
L546023	u2906	m191	PICARD	Better?
L546022	u2903	m191	KIRK	No, no, it's not. It's better.
L546018	u2903	m191	KIRK	I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
L546017	u2906	m191	PICARD	You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
L546016	u2903	m191	KIRK	You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
L546013	u2903	m191	KIRK	Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
L546012	u2906	m191	PICARD	Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
L546011	u2903	m191	KIRK	So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
L545996	u2906	m191	PICARD	I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
L545995	u2903	m191	KIRK	This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
L545988	u2906	m191	PICARD	Yes, yes, it is.
L545987	u2903	m191	KIRK	Beautiful day, isn't it?
L545482	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
L545481	u2903	m191	KIRK	Kirk here.
L545478	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	I always do.
L545477	u2903	m191	KIRK	Keep her together until I get back.
L545473	u2903	m191	KIRK	Where are the deflector relays?
L545472	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
L545469	u2903	m191	KIRK	Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
L545468	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Aye.
L545467	u2903	m191	KIRK	A photon torpedo?
L545466	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
L545465	u2903	m191	KIRK	I thought you might.
L545464	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	But I do have a theory...
L545462	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
L545461	u2903	m191	KIRK	The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
L545443	u2903	m191	KIRK	Phasing? To where?
L545442	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
L545384	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
L545383	u2903	m191	KIRK	Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
L545382	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	And what would that be, sir?
L545381	u2903	m191	KIRK	You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
L545356	u2903	m191	KIRK	When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
L545355	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
L545354	u2903	m191	KIRK	I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
L545351	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
L545350	u2903	m191	KIRK	Oh
L545758	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
L545757	u2909	m191	SORAN	We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
L545756	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	No, I didn't know that.
L545755	u2909	m191	SORAN	I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
L545754	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
L545753	u2909	m191	SORAN	Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
L545751	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
L545750	u2909	m191	SORAN	What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
L545749	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	No.
L545748	u2909	m191	SORAN	Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
L545747	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	I was ordered to by the Captain.
L545746	u2909	m191	SORAN	I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
L545743	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	What do you want?
L545742	u2909	m191	SORAN	Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
L545741	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	What's normal?
L545740	u2909	m191	SORAN	A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
L546082	u2906	m191	PICARD	You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
L546081	u2907	m191	RIKER	I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
L545831	u2906	m191	PICARD	Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
L545830	u2907	m191	RIKER	That's a pretty big margin of error.
L545822	u2906	m191	PICARD	They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
L545821	u2907	m191	RIKER	Maybe they're not out there.
L545672	u2906	m191	PICARD	How is that possible?
L545671	u2907	m191	RIKER	A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
L545670	u2906	m191	PICARD	Report.
L545584	u2906	m191	PICARD	No. Thank you.
L545583	u2907	m191	RIKER	Sir, is there anything wrong?
L545582	u2906	m191	PICARD	Understood. That will be all.
L545581	u2907	m191	RIKER	There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
L545580	u2906	m191	PICARD	Thank you, Number One.
L545579	u2907	m191	RIKER	No, sir.
L545578	u2906	m191	PICARD	Is there a problem?
L545577	u2907	m191	RIKER	You want me to contact Starfleet?
L545576	u2906	m191	PICARD	Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
L545575	u2907	m191	RIKER	We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
L545574	u2906	m191	PICARD	There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
L545547	u2906	m191	PICARD	Make it so.
L545546	u2907	m191	RIKER	Sir?
L545524	u2907	m191	RIKER	Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
L545523	u2906	m191	PICARD	Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
L545521	u2907	m191	RIKER	Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
L545520	u2906	m191	PICARD	Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
L545511	u2907	m191	RIKER	When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
L545510	u2906	m191	PICARD	Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
L545824	u2906	m191	PICARD	Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
L545823	u2910	m191	TROI	Or perhaps they're on the surface.
L545664	u2910	m191	TROI	There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
L545663	u2906	m191	PICARD	My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
L545662	u2910	m191	TROI	You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
L545661	u2906	m191	PICARD	Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
L545660	u2910	m191	TROI	Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
L545659	u2906	m191	PICARD	In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
L545658	u2910	m191	TROI	It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
L545657	u2906	m191	PICARD	What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
L545656	u2910	m191	TROI	Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
L545654	u2906	m191	PICARD	All right, all right. You've made your point.
L545653	u2910	m191	TROI	"Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  ""Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"""
L545652	u2906	m191	PICARD	Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
L545651	u2910	m191	TROI	You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
L545650	u2906	m191	PICARD	As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
L545649	u2910	m191	TROI	I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
L545648	u2906	m191	PICARD	Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
L545647	u2910	m191	TROI	Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
L545646	u2906	m191	PICARD	Counselor. What can I do for you?
L545532	u2906	m191	PICARD	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
L545531	u2910	m191	TROI	Captain, are you all right?
L545884	u2906	m191	PICARD	Thank you.
L545883	u2909	m191	SORAN	Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
L545880	u2909	m191	SORAN	Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
L545879	u2906	m191	PICARD	The Nexus.
L545878	u2909	m191	SORAN	What if I told you I found a new truth?
L545877	u2906	m191	PICARD	We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
L545867	u2906	m191	PICARD	Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
L545866	u2909	m191	SORAN	I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
L545856	u2909	m191	SORAN	The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
L545855	u2906	m191	PICARD	The thought had crossed my mind.
L545854	u2909	m191	SORAN	You must think I'm quite the madman.
L545604	u2906	m191	PICARD	We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
L545603	u2909	m191	SORAN	The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
L545602	u2906	m191	PICARD	Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
L545601	u2909	m191	SORAN	Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
L545600	u2906	m191	PICARD	Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
L545599	u2909	m191	SORAN	Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
L545598	u2906	m191	PICARD	Doctor Soran?
L545909	u2907	m191	RIKER	We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
L545908	u2911	m191	WORF	Aye, sir.
L545907	u2907	m191	RIKER	Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
L545905	u2907	m191	RIKER	Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
L545904	u2911	m191	WORF	As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
L545900	u2911	m191	WORF	I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
L545899	u2907	m191	RIKER	Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
L545898	u2911	m191	WORF	It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
L545894	u2907	m191	RIKER	Lock phasers and return fire!
L545893	u2911	m191	WORF	They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
L545708	u2907	m191	RIKER	Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
L545707	u2911	m191	WORF	I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
L545674	u2907	m191	RIKER	The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
L545673	u2911	m191	WORF	Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
L545612	u2911	m191	WORF	Aye, sir.
L545611	u2907	m191	RIKER	Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
L545610	u2907	m191	RIKER	Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
L545609	u2911	m191	WORF	An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
L545608	u2907	m191	RIKER	Trilithium?
L545607	u2911	m191	WORF	One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
L545549	u2907	m191	RIKER	Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
L545548	u2911	m191	WORF	These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
L545542	u2911	m191	WORF	There are no other ships in the system.
L545541	u2907	m191	RIKER	It looks like we're too late.
L545536	u2907	m191	RIKER	You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
L545535	u2911	m191	WORF	The royal...studs?
L538174	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
L538173	u3006	m197	ADMIRAL DONALD	The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
L538172	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
L538167	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
L538166	u3006	m197	ADMIRAL DONALD	Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
L538165	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	Admiral Donald...Bill...
L538164	u3006	m197	ADMIRAL DONALD	Mr. President.
L538792	u3007	m197	BONES	That's the question -
L538791	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Or not to be -
L538749	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
L538748	u3007	m197	BONES	Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
L538747	u3007	m197	BONES	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
L538746	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
L538738	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We DO sleep lying down.
L538737	u3007	m197	BONES	Spock, that was actually funny.
L538736	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Vulcans sleep lying down...
L538735	u3007	m197	BONES	Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
L538731	u3007	m197	BONES	Fascinating...
L538730	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You may need assistance, doctor...
L538729	u3007	m197	BONES	I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
L538582	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The charge is murder.
L538581	u3007	m197	BONES	I believe the operation is over.
L538104	u3007	m197	BONES	I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
L538103	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Good luck, Captain.
L538790	u3012	m197	KIRK	To be -
L538789	u3007	m197	BONES	And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
L538788	u3012	m197	KIRK	Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
L538557	u3012	m197	KIRK	Come on...
L538556	u3007	m197	BONES	ABSOLUTELY NOT!
L538545	u3012	m197	KIRK	Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
L538544	u3007	m197	BONES	Damned clever if you ask me...
L538526	u3012	m197	KIRK	She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
L538525	u3007	m197	BONES	ARE YOU CRAZY?
L538515	u3012	m197	KIRK	Spock's looking for us...
L538514	u3007	m197	BONES	If they're even looking for us...
L538513	u3012	m197	KIRK	Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
L538512	u3007	m197	BONES	That cunning little Vulcan...
L538511	u3012	m197	KIRK	It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
L538510	u3012	m197	KIRK	No way.  You see this?
L538509	u3007	m197	BONES	Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
L538489	u3012	m197	KIRK	Don't remind me.
L538488	u3007	m197	BONES	What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
L538470	u3007	m197	BONES	More than ever.
L538469	u3012	m197	KIRK	Still think we're finished?
L538468	u3007	m197	BONES	What is it with you, anyway?
L538456	u3007	m197	BONES	Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
L538455	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
L538454	u3007	m197	BONES	Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
L538453	u3012	m197	KIRK	No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
L538452	u3007	m197	BONES	Specifically of...?
L538451	u3012	m197	KIRK	Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
L538450	u3007	m197	BONES	Are we playing multiple choice?
L538449	u3012	m197	KIRK	I didn't mean this future.
L538448	u3007	m197	BONES	That was the general idea I intended to convey.
L538447	u3012	m197	KIRK	Bones, are you afraid of the future?
L538446	u3007	m197	BONES	- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
L538445	u3007	m197	BONES	Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
L538444	u3012	m197	KIRK	We're not finished.
L538443	u3007	m197	BONES	Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
L538432	u3007	m197	BONES	Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
L538431	u3012	m197	KIRK	Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
L538396	u3012	m197	KIRK	We've been set up all along.
L538395	u3007	m197	BONES	Figures.
L538390	u3007	m197	BONES	What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
L538389	u3012	m197	KIRK	Thanks...
L538129	u3007	m197	BONES	Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
L538128	u3012	m197	KIRK	No!
L538125	u3007	m197	BONES	Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
L538124	u3012	m197	KIRK	Can you - ?
L538123	u3007	m197	BONES	Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
L538097	u3012	m197	KIRK	I wish I knew. Uhura?
L538096	u3007	m197	BONES	What the Hell's going on?
L537921	u3012	m197	KIRK	You heard the order, Lieutenant.
L537920	u3007	m197	BONES	Uh, Jim...
L538777	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
L538776	u3007	m197	BONES	They don't arrest people for having feelings.
L538722	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	In space, no one can hear you sweat.
L538721	u3007	m197	BONES	Too bad we can't SMELL her.
L538698	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
L538697	u3007	m197	BONES	This is fun...
L538672	u3007	m197	BONES	Now there's a poser.
L538671	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
L538031	u3007	m197	BONES	"Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of ""exploration""..."
L538030	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	We're explorers not diplomats!
L538010	u3007	m197	BONES	And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
L538009	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
L538283	u3008	m197	CHANG	The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
L538282	u3007	m197	BONES	I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
L538281	u3008	m197	CHANG	You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
L538280	u3007	m197	BONES	I was nervous -
L538277	u3008	m197	CHANG	You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
L538276	u3007	m197	BONES	I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
L538275	u3008	m197	CHANG	"Have you saved patients as ""barely"" alive as he was?"
L538274	u3007	m197	BONES	Barely.
L538273	u3008	m197	CHANG	Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
L538268	u3008	m197	CHANG	Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
L538267	u3007	m197	BONES	Retire.
L538266	u3008	m197	CHANG	Stand...?
L538265	u3007	m197	BONES	For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
L538264	u3007	m197	BONES	Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
L538263	u3008	m197	CHANG	Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
L538121	u3007	m197	BONES	Then let me help!
L538120	u3008	m197	CHANG	We were until your torpedoes!
L538119	u3007	m197	BONES	Are you carrying a surgeon?
L538523	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
L538522	u3007	m197	BONES	I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
L538521	u3014	m197	MARTIA	It takes a lot of effort.
L538427	u3007	m197	BONES	That's a comfort...
L538426	u3014	m197	MARTIA	They'll respect him now...
L538403	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
L538402	u3007	m197	BONES	What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
L538401	u3014	m197	MARTIA	They'll make it look like an accident...
L538400	u3007	m197	BONES	I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
L538324	u3008	m197	CHANG	Your honors, the State rests.
L538323	u3012	m197	KIRK	As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
L538320	u3008	m197	CHANG	So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
L538319	u3012	m197	KIRK	I am.
L538318	u3008	m197	CHANG	Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
L538317	u3012	m197	KIRK	I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
L538316	u3008	m197	CHANG	You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
L538315	u3012	m197	KIRK	Well, I -
L538314	u3008	m197	CHANG	You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
L538311	u3008	m197	CHANG	And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
L538310	u3012	m197	KIRK	I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
L538309	u3008	m197	CHANG	For insubordination.
L538308	u3012	m197	KIRK	Yes.
L538307	u3008	m197	CHANG	You were demoted...
L538296	u3012	m197	KIRK	Those words WERE spoken by me.
L538295	u3008	m197	CHANG	Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
L538294	u3012	m197	KIRK	Yes...
L538293	u3008	m197	CHANG	Spoken by you?
L538292	u3012	m197	KIRK	Yes.
L538291	u3008	m197	CHANG	Are those your words?
L538286	u3008	m197	CHANG	That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
L538285	u3012	m197	KIRK	That isn't true...!
L538284	u3008	m197	CHANG	And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
L538250	u3012	m197	KIRK	That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
L538249	u3008	m197	CHANG	And what did they tell you?
L538248	u3012	m197	KIRK	I checked the data banks, yes.
L538247	u3008	m197	CHANG	Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
L538246	u3012	m197	KIRK	There... were no other ships in the sector.
L538245	u3008	m197	CHANG	And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
L538244	u3012	m197	KIRK	The drink WAS served...
L538243	u3008	m197	CHANG	Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
L538242	u3012	m197	KIRK	What?
L538136	u3008	m197	CHANG	Take them away.
L538135	u3012	m197	KIRK	He just tried to save him!
L538134	u3008	m197	CHANG	Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
L538118	u3008	m197	CHANG	How can I trust --
L538117	u3012	m197	KIRK	He's a DOCTOR!
L538115	u3008	m197	CHANG	You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
L538114	u3012	m197	KIRK	WHAT HAPPENED?
L538113	u3008	m197	CHANG	You feign ignorance?
L538112	u3012	m197	KIRK	My God, what happened here?
L538001	u3012	m197	KIRK	I beg your pardon?
L538000	u3008	m197	CHANG	To be or not to be, that is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
L537992	u3008	m197	CHANG	Very much.
L537991	u3012	m197	KIRK	Would you care to go topside?
L537981	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm not sure how to take that.
L537980	u3008	m197	CHANG	I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
L538794	u3012	m197	KIRK	Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
L538793	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Course heading, Captain?
L538733	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Aye, sir; thrusters...
L538732	u3012	m197	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
L538692	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Aye, sir; thrusters...
L538691	u3012	m197	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
L538690	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Shields up. Battle stations.
L538689	u3012	m197	KIRK	Shields. Battle stations.
L538686	u3012	m197	KIRK	Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
L538685	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	But if she's cloaked...
L538684	u3012	m197	KIRK	She's here - somewhere.
L538624	u3012	m197	KIRK	She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
L538623	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Where IS the conference?
L538604	u3012	m197	KIRK	Who else?
L538603	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	From Starfleet?
L538570	u3012	m197	KIRK	First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
L538569	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	"Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on ""Stun"" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body..."
L538090	u3012	m197	KIRK	Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
L538089	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
L538069	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura, monitor!
L538068	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Torpedo room--?
L538065	u3012	m197	KIRK	I know what you mean...
L538064	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Just the size of my head -
L537994	u3012	m197	KIRK	Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
L537993	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
L537864	u3012	m197	KIRK	Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
L537863	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Where is Mr. Sulu?
L538584	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	She programmed the torpedo hits?
L538583	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
L538499	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
L538498	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
L538476	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	ALL uniforms?
L538475	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
L538474	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Now we go to Starfleet?
L538473	u3020	m197	SPOCK	This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
L538472	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
L538471	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Klingon blood.
L538369	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You tell them, Lieutenant.
L538368	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
L538367	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
L538083	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Shields up, Captain --?
L538082	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're preparing to fire.
L538298	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
L538297	u3021	m197	SULU	"Send to commander Enterprise: ""We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior."" Attach our co-ordinates."
L537857	u3021	m197	SULU	Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
L537856	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Do we report this, sir?
L537855	u3021	m197	SULU	An INCIDENT?
L537852	u3021	m197	SULU	Onscreen.
L537851	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
L537845	u3021	m197	SULU	Mr. Valtane, any more data?
L537844	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Aye, sir.
L538037	u3012	m197	KIRK	We must do this again soon.
L538036	u3011	m197	GORKON	Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
L537990	u3011	m197	GORKON	This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
L537989	u3012	m197	KIRK	Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
L537988	u3011	m197	GORKON	Your research laboratory is most impressive...
L537978	u3011	m197	GORKON	Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
L537977	u3012	m197	KIRK	Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
L537967	u3011	m197	GORKON	I shall look forward to it.
L537966	u3012	m197	KIRK	We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
L537965	u3011	m197	GORKON	We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
L537964	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
L537963	u3011	m197	GORKON	Thank you, Captain.
L537962	u3012	m197	KIRK	Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
L537961	u3011	m197	GORKON	This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
L538542	u3012	m197	KIRK	Not me, idiot - HIM!
L538541	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	Kill him! He's the one!!
L538540	u3012	m197	KIRK	What took you so long?
L538539	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	I like it here...
L538538	u3012	m197	KIRK	Isn't it about time you became something else?
L538534	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	They'll be here...
L538533	u3012	m197	KIRK	Your friends are late...
L538531	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
L538530	u3012	m197	KIRK	An accident wasn't good enough...
L538520	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	Give a girl a chance, Captain.
L538519	u3012	m197	KIRK	"I've heard of chameloids - ""Shapeshifters"" - I thought you were mythical."
L538466	u3012	m197	KIRK	Candidate for what?
L538465	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
L538464	u3012	m197	KIRK	Possibly.
L538463	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
L538462	u3012	m197	KIRK	Where do we come in?
L538461	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I know how to get outside the shield.
L538460	u3014	m197	MARTIA	It IS possible.
L538459	u3012	m197	KIRK	Except us.
L538458	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
L538434	u3012	m197	KIRK	There's gotta be a way out of this place...
L538433	u3014	m197	MARTIA	When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
L538430	u3012	m197	KIRK	Anything else you want to tell me?
L538429	u3014	m197	MARTIA	That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
L538405	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
L538404	u3012	m197	KIRK	How much time's left of your sentence?
L538399	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
L538398	u3012	m197	KIRK	We didn't kill Gorkon.
L538397	u3014	m197	MARTIA	We don't get many presidential assassins.
L538394	u3014	m197	MARTIA	There's a reward for your death.
L538393	u3012	m197	KIRK	How did you know...?
L538387	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Krandog aranty.
L538386	u3012	m197	KIRK	Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
L538385	u3014	m197	MARTIA	And your coat.
L538384	u3012	m197	KIRK	He's got it.
L538383	u3014	m197	MARTIA	He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
L538612	u3012	m197	KIRK	WHO ELSE...?
L538611	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	This is incredible -
L538095	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Aye, sir.
L538094	u3012	m197	KIRK	Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
L538093	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Captain, if --
L538092	u3012	m197	KIRK	Stand down your weapons.
L537975	u3012	m197	KIRK	Energize...
L537974	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
L538642	u3012	m197	KIRK	You hear that?
L538641	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Just the prototype.
L538600	u3012	m197	KIRK	Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.
L538599	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
L538598	u3012	m197	KIRK	"Who is ""US?"""
L538085	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura, signal our surrender.
L538084	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Captain, our shields -- !
L538063	u3012	m197	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
L538062	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Sir?
L538061	u3012	m197	KIRK	Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
L537969	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Captain.
L537968	u3012	m197	KIRK	I hope you're happy.
L537958	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
L537957	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
L537942	u3012	m197	KIRK	Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
L537941	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I always wanted to try that.
L537940	u3012	m197	KIRK	You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
L537939	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
L537937	u3012	m197	KIRK	Right -
L537936	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
L537935	u3012	m197	KIRK	Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
L537934	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Sorry -
L537930	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L537929	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
L537928	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Kronos, sir?
L537927	u3012	m197	KIRK	Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
L537926	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L537919	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
L537918	u3012	m197	KIRK	Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
L537917	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Aft thrusters -
L537901	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
L537900	u3012	m197	KIRK	As you were. Lieutenant...?
L538647	u3021	m197	SULU	Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
L538646	u3012	m197	KIRK	Thank you, Captain Sulu.
L538645	u3021	m197	SULU	According to my information, today.
L538644	u3012	m197	KIRK	When does this conference start?
L538643	u3021	m197	SULU	I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
L538640	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
L538639	u3021	m197	SULU	Surely not.
L538638	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
L538637	u3021	m197	SULU	The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
L538636	u3012	m197	KIRK	Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
L538635	u3021	m197	SULU	I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
L538634	u3012	m197	KIRK	You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
L538633	u3021	m197	SULU	Standing by, Captain Kirk.
L538632	u3012	m197	KIRK	Sulu!
L538631	u3021	m197	SULU	This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
L538779	u3020	m197	SPOCK	... is to trust him.
L538778	u3012	m197	KIRK	The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
L538769	u3012	m197	KIRK	Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
L538768	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
L538767	u3012	m197	KIRK	"But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - ""the undiscovered country""..."
L538704	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
L538703	u3012	m197	KIRK	What's she waiting for?
L538688	u3012	m197	KIRK	Make ourselves a target?
L538687	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
L538679	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Not yet... Section 4236...
L538678	u3012	m197	KIRK	Close enough to beam down?
L538667	u3012	m197	KIRK	Spock, you want to know something?
L538666	u3020	m197	SPOCK	But I am not human. I am only -
L538665	u3012	m197	KIRK	Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
L538664	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I SHOULD have been -
L538663	u3012	m197	KIRK	"Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter ""S."" You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -"
L538662	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
L538661	u3012	m197	KIRK	Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
L538660	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
L538659	u3012	m197	KIRK	You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
L538658	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
L538657	u3012	m197	KIRK	I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
L538656	u3012	m197	KIRK	The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
L538655	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
L538654	u3012	m197	KIRK	Are you dining on worms?
L538629	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The Commander is an old friend of yours.
L538628	u3012	m197	KIRK	Why would they give them to us?
L538627	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
L538620	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
L538619	u3012	m197	KIRK	What peace conference?
L538618	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The peace conference.
L538565	u3012	m197	KIRK	So, that's it..
L538564	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
L538553	u3012	m197	KIRK	He was just about to explain the whole damn -
L538552	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Captain...
L538102	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Perhaps you're right.
L538101	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
L538100	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
L538079	u3020	m197	SPOCK	According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
L538078	u3012	m197	KIRK	We HAVEN'T fired -
L538067	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
L538066	u3012	m197	KIRK	What the -
L538060	u3012	m197	KIRK	From Enterprise?
L538059	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
L538058	u3012	m197	KIRK	Where?
L538057	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
L538056	u3012	m197	KIRK	Spock, I'm really tired...
L538055	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I am uncertain.
L538054	u3012	m197	KIRK	What is it?
L538048	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
L538047	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
L538013	u3012	m197	KIRK	Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
L538012	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
L537956	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
L537955	u3012	m197	KIRK	Never been this close.
L537903	u3012	m197	KIRK	Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
L537902	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
L537892	u3012	m197	KIRK	LET THEM DIE.
L537891	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're dying.
L537890	u3012	m197	KIRK	DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
L537889	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
L537888	u3012	m197	KIRK	I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
L537887	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I was asked by my father to open neg-
L537886	u3012	m197	KIRK	How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
L537885	u3020	m197	SPOCK	There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
L537884	u3012	m197	KIRK	WE volunteered?
L537881	u3012	m197	KIRK	You have personally -
L537880	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
L537878	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
L537877	u3012	m197	KIRK	Me?
L538720	u3012	m197	KIRK	Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
L538719	u3022	m197	UHURA	Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
L538694	u3022	m197	UHURA	Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
L538693	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura?
L538608	u3012	m197	KIRK	Who else?
L538607	u3022	m197	UHURA	Gorkon's own man??
L538099	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
L538098	u3022	m197	UHURA	It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
L538088	u3022	m197	UHURA	This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
L538087	u3012	m197	KIRK	WE SURRENDER.
L538086	u3022	m197	UHURA	Captain --
L537960	u3012	m197	KIRK	This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
L537959	u3022	m197	UHURA	Channel open, Captain.
L537912	u3012	m197	KIRK	Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
L537911	u3022	m197	UHURA	Control tower, reading, Sir.
L538595	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
L538594	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
L538588	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	You can't prove any of this...
L538587	u3020	m197	SPOCK	But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
L538579	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I believe you. Please...
L538578	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I don't want to.
L538577	u3020	m197	SPOCK	If you are logical.
L538421	u3020	m197	SPOCK	An error.
L538420	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	A lie?
L538413	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
L538412	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
L538408	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
L538407	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
L538406	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Any progress?
L538233	u3020	m197	SPOCK	An omission. After that -
L538232	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	A lie?
L538231	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
L538230	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
L538229	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
L538228	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Not as yet, sir.
L538227	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
L538224	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Such things have happened before, sir.
L538223	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Her own father...?
L538146	u3020	m197	SPOCK	In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
L538145	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	How did you - ?
L538142	u3020	m197	SPOCK	What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
L538141	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
L537951	u3020	m197	SPOCK	That the universe will unfold as it should.
L537950	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Faith...?
L537949	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You must have faith.
L537946	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
L537945	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
L537944	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
L538622	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
L538621	u3022	m197	UHURA	We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
L538186	u3022	m197	UHURA	We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
L538185	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
L538184	u3022	m197	UHURA	We've been ordered to -
L538183	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Trouble?
L538071	u3022	m197	UHURA	Confirmed, Captain!
L538070	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Direct hit -
L538442	u3016	m197	OFFICER	No, sir.
L538441	u3021	m197	SULU	You having hearing problems, mister?
L538440	u3016	m197	OFFICER	Sir?
L538439	u3021	m197	SULU	Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
L538438	u3016	m197	OFFICER	Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
L538437	u3021	m197	SULU	What?
L538436	u3016	m197	OFFICER	Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
L537850	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	What's left of it.
L537849	u3021	m197	SULU	Praxis?
L537848	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
L537847	u3021	m197	SULU	What is it?
L537846	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
L537843	u3021	m197	SULU	"Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: ""This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"""
L537842	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
L537841	u3021	m197	SULU	Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
L537829	u3021	m197	SULU	Visual!
L537828	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
L537827	u3021	m197	SULU	Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
L537826	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
L537825	u3021	m197	SULU	According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
L538497	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Aye, aye, sir.
L538496	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
L538419	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
L538418	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	- could take weeks, sir.
L538359	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I believe I am.
L538358	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
L538357	u3020	m197	SPOCK	This one can.
L538356	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
L538353	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Would they?
L538352	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
L538351	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
L538348	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Not from us!
L538347	u3020	m197	SPOCK	There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
L538346	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
L538235	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I know precisely where he'll be.
L538234	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
L538226	u3020	m197	SPOCK	That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
L538225	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
L538220	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Then someone forged a data bank entry.
L538219	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	And if they're still in place?
L538218	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Nevertheless.
L538217	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	That could take hours!
L538216	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
L538215	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
L538214	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I think  not.
L538213	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	A computer canna lie, sir.
L538212	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
L538211	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
L538148	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
L538147	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	NO WAY!
L538144	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
L538143	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
L538775	u3020	m197	SPOCK	But you didn't join a conspiracy.
L538774	u3022	m197	UHURA	They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
L538728	u3022	m197	UHURA	Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
L538727	u3020	m197	SPOCK	"Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it ""Plasma"" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas."
L538725	u3022	m197	UHURA	Maybe we should write them a letter?
L538724	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
L538425	u3020	m197	SPOCK	At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
L538424	u3022	m197	UHURA	You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
L538416	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
L538415	u3022	m197	UHURA	I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
L538364	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
L538363	u3022	m197	UHURA	Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
L538362	u3020	m197	SPOCK	And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
L538345	u3020	m197	SPOCK	It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
L538344	u3022	m197	UHURA	What exactly does that mean?
L538343	u3020	m197	SPOCK	An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
L538301	u3020	m197	SPOCK	He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
L538300	u3022	m197	UHURA	Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
L538140	u3022	m197	UHURA	Yes, sir.
L538139	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
L538008	u3022	m197	UHURA	How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
L538007	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
L550988	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just not the eyes.
L550987	u3053	m200	BEEMER	I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
L550986	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
L550985	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
L550984	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
L550983	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Bullshit politics.
L550982	u3057	m200	LENNY	I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
L550981	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Yeah, that's right.
L550726	u3057	m200	LENNY	A star is born.
L550725	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	No problem.
L550724	u3057	m200	LENNY	Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
L550723	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	Yeah, right.
L550722	u3057	m200	LENNY	"Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it ""being wired,"" but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?"
L550721	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	Hey, fuck you, man.
L550720	u3057	m200	LENNY	Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
L550719	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	What's all this squid shit?
L550718	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
L551312	u3055	m200	FAITH	I live for the moment.
L551311	u3062	m200	TRAN	Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
L551310	u3055	m200	FAITH	Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
L551065	u3062	m200	TRAN	Maybe later.
L551064	u3055	m200	FAITH	Fuck you.
L551063	u3062	m200	TRAN	The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
L551062	u3062	m200	TRAN	I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
L551061	u3055	m200	FAITH	He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
L551060	u3062	m200	TRAN	"Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  ""Stand by your man"". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him."
L551059	u3055	m200	FAITH	You said you were going to get her out of this.
L551057	u3062	m200	TRAN	You're going down.
L551056	u3055	m200	FAITH	I made my choice, Lenny.
L551051	u3062	m200	TRAN	A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
L551050	u3055	m200	FAITH	Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
L550939	u3062	m200	TRAN	Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
L550938	u3055	m200	FAITH	You're too goddamned paranoid.
L550937	u3062	m200	TRAN	He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
L550936	u3055	m200	FAITH	Leave him alone, Tran.
L550935	u3062	m200	TRAN	Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
L550931	u3062	m200	TRAN	Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
L550930	u3055	m200	FAITH	We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
L551428	u3055	m200	FAITH	'We might as well make the best of it.'
L551427	u3059	m200	MAX	And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
L551426	u3055	m200	FAITH	Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
L551425	u3059	m200	MAX	I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
L551424	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
L551423	u3059	m200	MAX	You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
L551388	u3055	m200	FAITH	My God.
L551387	u3059	m200	MAX	Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
L551385	u3059	m200	MAX	Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
L551384	u3055	m200	FAITH	Jesus.
L551383	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
L551382	u3055	m200	FAITH	You can't just... kill him.
L551381	u3055	m200	FAITH	What're you going to do?
L551380	u3059	m200	MAX	Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
L551379	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
L551378	u3059	m200	MAX	This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
L551300	u3055	m200	FAITH	What a nightmare.
L551299	u3057	m200	LENNY	The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
L551298	u3055	m200	FAITH	You think Tran killed her?
L551297	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
L551296	u3055	m200	FAITH	So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
L551286	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Mace is in this.
L551285	u3055	m200	FAITH	We should talk alone.
L551284	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
L551283	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
L551282	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
L551281	u3055	m200	FAITH	What's going on?
L551048	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tell me.
L551047	u3055	m200	FAITH	You don't know what you're fucking with here.
L551046	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
L551045	u3055	m200	FAITH	Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
L551044	u3057	m200	LENNY	Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
L551043	u3055	m200	FAITH	Who did it?
L551042	u3057	m200	LENNY	Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
L551041	u3055	m200	FAITH	You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
L550969	u3055	m200	FAITH	"You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say ""The End."" You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes."
L550968	u3057	m200	LENNY	Can't do it.
L550967	u3055	m200	FAITH	Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
L550966	u3057	m200	LENNY	Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
L550965	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
L550964	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
L550963	u3055	m200	FAITH	Damn right.
L550962	u3057	m200	LENNY	Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
L550961	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
L550960	u3055	m200	FAITH	Maybe.
L550959	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?  He gonna record you on his label?
L550958	u3055	m200	FAITH	He has his uses too.
L550957	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
L550956	u3055	m200	FAITH	That's a good one, coming from you.
L550955	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
L550954	u3055	m200	FAITH	Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
L550953	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
L550952	u3055	m200	FAITH	Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
L550951	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tonight.
L550950	u3055	m200	FAITH	You talked to Iris?  When?
L550949	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
L550948	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to go.  I mean it.
L550947	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'm already hurting.
L550946	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
L550945	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
L550933	u3055	m200	FAITH	No, Lenny.
L550932	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, call me, okay?
L550926	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just got to talk to you for one second.
L550925	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
L550920	u3057	m200	LENNY	Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
L550919	u3055	m200	FAITH	Cut it out, Tran.
L550881	u3055	m200	FAITH	Make me forget it, baby.
L550880	u3057	m200	LENNY	Forget it's there.
L550879	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
L550878	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
L550877	u3055	m200	FAITH	I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
L550736	u3057	m200	LENNY	Watch and see.
L550735	u3055	m200	FAITH	Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
L550773	u3057	m200	LENNY	You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
L550772	u3056	m200	KEITH	Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
L550769	u3057	m200	LENNY	Step into my office.
L550768	u3056	m200	KEITH	What?  Right Here?
L550767	u3057	m200	LENNY	Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
L550766	u3056	m200	KEITH	Talk to me about costs, here.
L550765	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
L550764	u3056	m200	KEITH	Sounds good.
L550761	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
L550760	u3056	m200	KEITH	What kind of things exactly?
L550759	u3057	m200	LENNY	That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
L550758	u3056	m200	KEITH	Clips.
L550757	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
L550756	u3056	m200	KEITH	Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
L550755	u3057	m200	LENNY	A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
L550754	u3056	m200	KEITH	No.
L550750	u3056	m200	KEITH	That's right.
L550749	u3057	m200	LENNY	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
L550748	u3056	m200	KEITH	I understand.  No, I'm not.
L551421	u3059	m200	MAX	This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
L551420	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did you hook up with Faith?
L551419	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
L551418	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
L551417	u3059	m200	MAX	Naawww.
L551416	u3057	m200	LENNY	So there never was a death squad.
L551414	u3059	m200	MAX	You got froggy on me a couple times.
L551413	u3057	m200	LENNY	You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
L551412	u3059	m200	MAX	No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
L551411	u3057	m200	LENNY	And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
L551410	u3059	m200	MAX	Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
L551409	u3059	m200	MAX	I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
L551408	u3057	m200	LENNY	I won't say anything.
L551407	u3059	m200	MAX	Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
L551405	u3059	m200	MAX	You bet.  Did you like it?
L551404	u3057	m200	LENNY	Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
L551403	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
L551402	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
L551401	u3059	m200	MAX	That's pretty much the way it happened.
L551400	u3057	m200	LENNY	So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
L551399	u3059	m200	MAX	You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
L551398	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus!
L551397	u3059	m200	MAX	You just did.
L551396	u3057	m200	LENNY	What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
L551395	u3059	m200	MAX	I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
L551394	u3057	m200	LENNY	Where's Faith?
L551393	u3059	m200	MAX	I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
L551392	u3059	m200	MAX	Only way I could stand your ties.
L551391	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
L551321	u3059	m200	MAX	I intend to.
L551320	u3057	m200	LENNY	2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
L551319	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
L551318	u3057	m200	LENNY	This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
L551317	u3059	m200	MAX	Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
L551316	u3057	m200	LENNY	What do you mean?
L551315	u3059	m200	MAX	He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
L551269	u3059	m200	MAX	No.  Bad idea.
L551268	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay... what about Strickland?
L551267	u3059	m200	MAX	Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
L551264	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
L551263	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
L551262	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus.
L551261	u3059	m200	MAX	Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
L551260	u3057	m200	LENNY	What stuff?
L551259	u3059	m200	MAX	All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
L551258	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whattya mean?
L551252	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
L551251	u3059	m200	MAX	Is he dead?
L551250	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's been cooked-off
L551248	u3057	m200	LENNY	You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
L551247	u3059	m200	MAX	Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
L551119	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
L551118	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
L551117	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
L551116	u3057	m200	LENNY	Looks like she was holding out.
L551115	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
L551114	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith OK?
L551112	u3057	m200	LENNY	W'sup, Max?
L551111	u3059	m200	MAX	Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
L551029	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why me?
L551028	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
L551025	u3057	m200	LENNY	He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
L551024	u3059	m200	MAX	Top ten.
L551023	u3057	m200	LENNY	But this is a bad one.
L551022	u3059	m200	MAX	So've I.  Too much.
L551021	u3057	m200	LENNY	So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
L551020	u3059	m200	MAX	But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
L551019	u3057	m200	LENNY	He records himself raping and killing her--
L551018	u3059	m200	MAX	And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
L551017	u3057	m200	LENNY	He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
L551016	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
L551015	u3057	m200	LENNY	Not now... I don't want to think about it--
L551014	u3059	m200	MAX	Let's work it.
L551013	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  No, not really.
L551012	u3059	m200	MAX	You alright?  Y'okay?
L550976	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her.
L550975	u3057	m200	LENNY	Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
L550974	u3059	m200	MAX	I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
L550973	u3057	m200	LENNY	You should feel like shit.
L550972	u3059	m200	MAX	I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
L550971	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
L550826	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shutup a second!
L550825	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
L550818	u3059	m200	MAX	An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
L550817	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
L550816	u3059	m200	MAX	See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
L550798	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, Iris, you okay?
L550797	u3059	m200	MAX	I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
L550796	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
L550795	u3059	m200	MAX	Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
L550794	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  She won't call me.
L550792	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
L550791	u3057	m200	LENNY	You were lucky, Max.
L550789	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
L550788	u3059	m200	MAX	That's not sayin' much.
L550787	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
L550786	u3059	m200	MAX	D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
L550785	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.
L550784	u3059	m200	MAX	Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
L550781	u3057	m200	LENNY	Least you can do.
L550780	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
L550779	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
L550778	u3059	m200	MAX	You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
L551155	u3057	m200	LENNY	She never gave me a tape.
L551154	u3061	m200	TICK	I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
L551153	u3057	m200	LENNY	What clip?  What was it?
L551152	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
L551151	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
L551150	u3061	m200	TICK	Iris, man.  Pay attention.
L551149	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who was just here?
L551148	u3061	m200	TICK	Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
L551147	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?
L551146	u3061	m200	TICK	Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
L551143	u3061	m200	TICK	Well... the guy's fucked up.
L551142	u3057	m200	LENNY	Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
L551141	u3061	m200	TICK	Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
L550690	u3057	m200	LENNY	What else you got?
L550689	u3061	m200	TICK	Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
L550688	u3057	m200	LENNY	I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
L550687	u3061	m200	TICK	Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
L550686	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
L550685	u3061	m200	TICK	Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
L550684	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
L550683	u3061	m200	TICK	Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
L550682	u3061	m200	TICK	Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
L550681	u3057	m200	LENNY	So lay it off to somebody else.
L550680	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
L550679	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
L550678	u3061	m200	TICK	Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
L550677	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
L550676	u3061	m200	TICK	I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
L550675	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
L550674	u3061	m200	TICK	With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
L550673	u3057	m200	LENNY	How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
L550672	u3061	m200	TICK	Sorry.
L550671	u3057	m200	LENNY	Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
L550670	u3061	m200	TICK	Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
L551055	u3062	m200	TRAN	I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
L551054	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's alright.  He means it.
L551053	u3062	m200	TRAN	Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
L551052	u3057	m200	LENNY	Charm.
L550928	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
L550927	u3062	m200	TRAN	About what?
L550924	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, can I talk to you a second?
L550923	u3062	m200	TRAN	I always do.
L550922	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
L550921	u3062	m200	TRAN	Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
L550918	u3062	m200	TRAN	I already got everything I need from you.
L550917	u3057	m200	LENNY	You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
L550916	u3062	m200	TRAN	You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
L550873	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Your existence.
L550872	u3057	m200	LENNY	Your sex life?
L550871	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
L550870	u3057	m200	LENNY	I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
L550869	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
L550868	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
L550867	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Commissioner Strickland.
L550866	u3057	m200	LENNY	Strickland.
L550865	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Nero.
L551451	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  See you there.
L551450	u3057	m200	LENNY	See you downtown.
L551449	u3058	m200	MACE	Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
L551448	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  We did.
L551447	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
L551443	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
L551442	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we under arrest?
L551363	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, right.  Fucked.
L551362	u3057	m200	LENNY	Then we'll be right where we are now.
L551361	u3058	m200	MACE	Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
L551360	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Trust me.
L551359	u3058	m200	MACE	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
L551358	u3057	m200	LENNY	Take it to him.
L551354	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
L551353	u3058	m200	MACE	That's the original.  There are no copies.
L551352	u3057	m200	LENNY	I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
L551351	u3058	m200	MACE	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
L551350	u3057	m200	LENNY	Alright.  We're going up.
L551348	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.
L551347	u3057	m200	LENNY	You see Tran?
L551346	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
L551345	u3057	m200	LENNY	Got your ticket?
L551344	u3058	m200	MACE	Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
L551343	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace... you're a girl.
L551340	u3058	m200	MACE	No, it's not.
L551339	u3057	m200	LENNY	But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
L551338	u3058	m200	MACE	You never told me.
L551337	u3057	m200	LENNY	I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
L551336	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  It didn't.
L551335	u3057	m200	LENNY	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
L551334	u3058	m200	MACE	I guess.
L551333	u3057	m200	LENNY	It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
L551332	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
L551325	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
L551324	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
L551323	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm not going.
L551322	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
L551294	u3058	m200	MACE	Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
L551293	u3057	m200	LENNY	Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
L551271	u3057	m200	LENNY	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
L551270	u3058	m200	MACE	Who's Strickland?
L551266	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, right, blow it open.
L551265	u3058	m200	MACE	The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
L551254	u3058	m200	MACE	How long does it last?  Oh.
L551253	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's totally cut off from the outer world.
L551246	u3057	m200	LENNY	To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
L551245	u3058	m200	MACE	Why?
L551244	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
L551243	u3058	m200	MACE	I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
L551242	u3057	m200	LENNY	It was a tough call.
L551241	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
L551240	u3057	m200	LENNY	There's a plus side?
L551239	u3058	m200	MACE	Well, look at the plus side.
L551238	u3057	m200	LENNY	So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
L551232	u3057	m200	LENNY	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
L551231	u3058	m200	MACE	People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
L551230	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've got a good idea, yeah.
L551229	u3058	m200	MACE	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
L551228	u3057	m200	LENNY	We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
L551226	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
L551225	u3058	m200	MACE	I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
L551224	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
L551203	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
L551202	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.  I won't do it.
L551201	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
L551200	u3058	m200	MACE	Tell me.
L551192	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
L551191	u3058	m200	MACE	You sure?
L551190	u3057	m200	LENNY	Those two guys were cops.
L551186	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
L551185	u3058	m200	MACE	I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
L551180	u3058	m200	MACE	Fire's out, isn't it?
L551179	u3057	m200	LENNY	Are you out of your fucking mind?!
L551178	u3057	m200	LENNY	The gas tank's going to go any second!
L551177	u3058	m200	MACE	This is bad.
L551176	u3058	m200	MACE	It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
L551175	u3057	m200	LENNY	Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
L551174	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
L551173	u3057	m200	LENNY	Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
L551172	u3058	m200	MACE	Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
L551171	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shit!
L551166	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
L551165	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, give them the tape.
L551158	u3058	m200	MACE	Something in your car...
L551157	u3057	m200	LENNY	She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
L551156	u3058	m200	MACE	Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
L551135	u3057	m200	LENNY	"Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful."
L551134	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, have you lost it completely?
L551131	u3057	m200	LENNY	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
L551130	u3058	m200	MACE	You better keep a low profile for a while.
L551129	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
L551128	u3058	m200	MACE	Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
L551126	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie doesn't go with blue!
L551125	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L551123	u3057	m200	LENNY	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
L551122	u3058	m200	MACE	Where we going?
L551121	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace!
L551120	u3058	m200	MACE	Whatup Lenny?
L551103	u3057	m200	LENNY	S'okay.  I know you still love me.
L551102	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
L551101	u3058	m200	MACE	OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
L551100	u3057	m200	LENNY	How's Zander?
L551099	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure.
L551098	u3057	m200	LENNY	The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
L551097	u3058	m200	MACE	Now you're really getting paranoid.
L551096	u3057	m200	LENNY	And what about the guy that was following me?
L551095	u3058	m200	MACE	That's where it gets a little strange.
L551094	u3057	m200	LENNY	Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
L551093	u3058	m200	MACE	Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
L551092	u3057	m200	LENNY	If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
L551091	u3058	m200	MACE	So the guy's not a sicko.
L551090	u3057	m200	LENNY	"She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason."
L551089	u3058	m200	MACE	Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
L551088	u3057	m200	LENNY	No it doesn't.
L551087	u3058	m200	MACE	But that doesn't add, does it.
L551086	u3057	m200	LENNY	See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
L551083	u3058	m200	MACE	It's not your fault.
L551082	u3057	m200	LENNY	She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
L551081	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
L551080	u3058	m200	MACE	No more, Lenny.
L551079	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
L551078	u3058	m200	MACE	Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
L551077	u3057	m200	LENNY	It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
L551076	u3058	m200	MACE	So that gives you something.
L551075	u3057	m200	LENNY	He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
L551073	u3057	m200	LENNY	Never really thought about it.
L551072	u3058	m200	MACE	You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
L551071	u3057	m200	LENNY	Is this great fabric or what?
L551039	u3058	m200	MACE	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
L551038	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
L551035	u3058	m200	MACE	This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
L551034	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
L551031	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
L551030	u3058	m200	MACE	Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
L551027	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wants to share.
L551026	u3058	m200	MACE	And gives it to you.
L551008	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you sure it's real?
L551007	u3057	m200	LENNY	Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
L551006	u3058	m200	MACE	Blackjack?  I don't understand--
L551005	u3057	m200	LENNY	Black.  Jack.
L551004	u3058	m200	MACE	My God, Lenny.  What is it?
L551000	u3057	m200	LENNY	Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
L550999	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L550995	u3057	m200	LENNY	No idea.
L550994	u3058	m200	MACE	What's that?  Present from Faith?
L550993	u3057	m200	LENNY	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
L550992	u3058	m200	MACE	What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
L550991	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
L550990	u3058	m200	MACE	You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
L550915	u3057	m200	LENNY	You'll see.
L550914	u3058	m200	MACE	Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
L550913	u3057	m200	LENNY	She's my destiny.
L550912	u3058	m200	MACE	She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
L550911	u3057	m200	LENNY	She still loves me.
L550910	u3058	m200	MACE	Forget her.
L550909	u3057	m200	LENNY	Rams... that's football, right?
L550908	u3058	m200	MACE	Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
L550907	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
L550905	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
L550904	u3057	m200	LENNY	Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
L550903	u3058	m200	MACE	Jesus, Lenny.
L550902	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
L550901	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
L550900	u3057	m200	LENNY	You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
L550899	u3058	m200	MACE	Look, I gotta get some sleep.
L550898	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
L550897	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
L550896	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey... I've never seen you like this.
L550895	u3058	m200	MACE	No, you're just trying to get off.
L550894	u3057	m200	LENNY	So am I.  Just trying to get by.
L550893	u3058	m200	MACE	No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
L550892	u3057	m200	LENNY	I thought we were friends.
L550891	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
L550890	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
L550889	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be no.
L550887	u3058	m200	MACE	Get it.
L550886	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need my case.  It's still in the back.
L550884	u3057	m200	LENNY	In LA?  Are you crazy?
L550883	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
L550882	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
L550876	u3057	m200	LENNY	Let's talk in the car.
L550875	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we having a bad night?
L550864	u3058	m200	MACE	You will not live to see the morning.
L550863	u3057	m200	LENNY	Coming with you.
L550862	u3058	m200	MACE	What the fuck are you doing?
L550860	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
L550859	u3058	m200	MACE	Fumitsu.
L550858	u3057	m200	LENNY	What's his name?
L550856	u3058	m200	MACE	Define love.
L550855	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but that was for love.
L550854	u3058	m200	MACE	Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
L550853	u3057	m200	LENNY	Define illegal.
L550852	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this shit's illegal.
L550851	u3057	m200	LENNY	Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
L550850	u3058	m200	MACE	Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
L550849	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
L550848	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
L550847	u3057	m200	LENNY	Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
L550846	u3058	m200	MACE	Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
L550845	u3057	m200	LENNY	No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
L550844	u3058	m200	MACE	So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
L550843	u3058	m200	MACE	Driving Mr. Lenny.
L550842	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace!  You're a life-saver.
L550841	u3058	m200	MACE	Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
L550840	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
L550839	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
L550838	u3058	m200	MACE	Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
L550837	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
L550836	u3058	m200	MACE	Sleaze to peddle.
L550835	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
L550834	u3058	m200	MACE	Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
L550833	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
L550820	u3057	m200	LENNY	They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
L550819	u3058	m200	MACE	Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
L551195	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Aw, Mom!
L551194	u3058	m200	MACE	We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
L551110	u3058	m200	MACE	Well give me some then... I'm starving.
L551109	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
L551108	u3058	m200	MACE	What is that?
L551107	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you going to make me beg?
L551106	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Right.  That explains it.
L551105	u3058	m200	MACE	Just Lenny.
L551104	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
L551276	u3059	m200	MAX	You really want that on your head?
L551275	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
L551274	u3059	m200	MAX	Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
L551273	u3058	m200	MACE	So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
L551257	u3059	m200	MAX	There's more to this whole thing than you think.
L551256	u3058	m200	MACE	This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
L551255	u3059	m200	MAX	Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
L551037	u3058	m200	MACE	Take the tape to the cops.
L551036	u3059	m200	MAX	Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
L551033	u3058	m200	MACE	Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
L551032	u3059	m200	MAX	He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
L550830	u3059	m200	MAX	Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
L550829	u3058	m200	MACE	But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
L550828	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L550827	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
L550822	u3059	m200	MAX	Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
L550821	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
L591383	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
L591382	u3186	m210	ALEX	Was that it? Well, ok.
L591334	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
L591333	u3186	m210	ALEX	You're wrong.
L591332	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
L591327	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
L591326	u3186	m210	ALEX	You sent them. I had no choice.
L591325	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
L591321	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
L591320	u3186	m210	ALEX	I'm looking for my friends.
L591319	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
L591317	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
L591316	u3186	m210	ALEX	Where are they? Last chance.
L591315	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
L591314	u3186	m210	ALEX	Where are they?
L591313	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I hate that picture.
L591259	u3186	m210	ALEX	What? Call the police?
L591258	u3196	m210	WALSH	I think we should get some support?
L591257	u3186	m210	ALEX	Where is it? This place?
L591249	u3196	m210	WALSH	I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
L591248	u3186	m210	ALEX	The strip joint?
L591247	u3196	m210	WALSH	"We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called ""The Hole."""
L591246	u3186	m210	ALEX	Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
L591168	u3196	m210	WALSH	Yeah. I sure will.
L591167	u3186	m210	ALEX	I was hoping you'd find out.
L591166	u3196	m210	WALSH	What do they do that they had to kill her?
L591165	u3186	m210	ALEX	Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
L591164	u3196	m210	WALSH	I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
L591163	u3186	m210	ALEX	You think I'm crazy.
L591162	u3186	m210	ALEX	The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 
L591161	u3196	m210	WALSH	Down? Wait, don't tell me.
L591160	u3186	m210	ALEX	Two down. Two to go.
L591157	u3186	m210	ALEX	Dream on.
L591156	u3196	m210	WALSH	Check and mate.
L590849	u3196	m210	WALSH	Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
L590848	u3186	m210	ALEX	We won't.
L590847	u3196	m210	WALSH	Tell her... we'll get him.
L590846	u3186	m210	ALEX	What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
L591004	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
L591003	u3186	m210	ALEX	You killed her. I saw it.
L591000	u3188	m210	DUTTON	There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
L590999	u3186	m210	ALEX	A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
L590998	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Fuck! What do you want?
L590996	u3186	m210	ALEX	"This is not just some ""thing."" It's A C zero zero five."
L590995	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Keep that thing away from me.
L590994	u3186	m210	ALEX	Think maybe knives do?
L590993	u3186	m210	ALEX	I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
L590992	u3188	m210	DUTTON	That was a fucking hollow point!
L590964	u3193	m210	TOMMY	A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
L590963	u3186	m210	ALEX	What did they give you?
L590962	u3193	m210	TOMMY	"They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head ""yes."""
L590961	u3186	m210	ALEX	What did they give you?
L590955	u3193	m210	TOMMY	Who are you?
L590954	u3186	m210	ALEX	Wrong. Answer.
L590953	u3193	m210	TOMMY	There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
L590952	u3186	m210	ALEX	One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
L590951	u3193	m210	TOMMY	What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
L590950	u3186	m210	ALEX	You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
L590949	u3193	m210	TOMMY	Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
L590948	u3186	m210	ALEX	Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
L590947	u3193	m210	TOMMY	I don't know you, man.
L590946	u3186	m210	ALEX	You lied at my trial.
L590945	u3186	m210	ALEX	Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
L590944	u3193	m210	TOMMY	Where the fuck did you come from?
L590943	u3186	m210	ALEX	Sssshhh. She's resting.
L591302	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	There is no scar. I'm telling you.
L591301	u3186	m210	ALEX	The scar.
L591300	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	Fucking Zombie.
L591299	u3186	m210	ALEX	Good thing in a situation like this.
L591298	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
L591297	u3186	m210	ALEX	AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
L591296	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	What Scar? What fucking scar?
L591295	u3186	m210	ALEX	"We're going to play a little game called ""Who's got the Scar."""
L591074	u3186	m210	ALEX	I was talking about you.
L591073	u3190	m210	ERLICH	You're him. Corvis.
L591072	u3186	m210	ALEX	How can you die if you're already dead?
L591071	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
L591069	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Nobody.
L591068	u3186	m210	ALEX	The scar. Which of you has it?
L591067	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
L591066	u3186	m210	ALEX	I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
L591065	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Not my arm! What you fucking want?
L591062	u3186	m210	ALEX	What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
L591061	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Fuck. Me.
L591058	u3186	m210	ALEX	I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
L591057	u3190	m210	ERLICH	You're the guy killed Dutton.
L591056	u3186	m210	ALEX	I heard you were looking for this.
L591388	u3186	m210	ALEX	Erin. I'll always be with you.
L591387	u3189	m210	ERIN	In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
L591360	u3189	m210	ERIN	No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
L591359	u3186	m210	ALEX	... it connects you to me...
L591256	u3189	m210	ERIN	I don't know. I found him lying there.
L591255	u3186	m210	ALEX	Erin. Who?
L591254	u3189	m210	ERIN	It's not. I can't take it.
L591253	u3186	m210	ALEX	It's ok, it's ok...
L591223	u3186	m210	ALEX	It's what Lauren would do.
L591222	u3189	m210	ERIN	I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
L591221	u3189	m210	ERIN	I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
L591220	u3186	m210	ALEX	All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
L591219	u3189	m210	ERIN	My father.
L591218	u3186	m210	ALEX	You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
L591217	u3186	m210	ALEX	Have to find him first.
L591216	u3189	m210	ERIN	So you're going to kill him?
L591215	u3186	m210	ALEX	... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
L591189	u3189	m210	ERIN	I don't want to see!
L591188	u3186	m210	ALEX	This tree. Here's where it happened.
L591180	u3189	m210	ERIN	Yes I do, I really do.
L591179	u3186	m210	ALEX	No. You don't.
L591178	u3189	m210	ERIN	It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
L591177	u3186	m210	ALEX	Erin. It's not your fault.
L591176	u3189	m210	ERIN	... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
L591175	u3186	m210	ALEX	No...
L591174	u3189	m210	ERIN	When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
L591173	u3186	m210	ALEX	Are you ok?
L591172	u3189	m210	ERIN	Yeah, I know.
L591171	u3186	m210	ALEX	This is where it happened. Right over here.
L591089	u3186	m210	ALEX	Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
L591088	u3189	m210	ERIN	No! Why are you haunting me?
L591087	u3186	m210	ALEX	From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
L591086	u3186	m210	ALEX	No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
L591085	u3189	m210	ERIN	My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
L591084	u3186	m210	ALEX	I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
L591082	u3189	m210	ERIN	You killed Lauren! You killed her!
L591081	u3186	m210	ALEX	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
L591080	u3189	m210	ERIN	I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
L591079	u3186	m210	ALEX	And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
L591078	u3189	m210	ERIN	You killed that cop Dutton.
L591077	u3186	m210	ALEX	I told you, I knew your sister.
L591076	u3189	m210	ERIN	Daisy. How did you know?
L590934	u3189	m210	ERIN	Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
L590933	u3186	m210	ALEX	I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
L590932	u3189	m210	ERIN	How do you know?
L590931	u3186	m210	ALEX	He didn't kill her.
L590930	u3189	m210	ERIN	You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
L590929	u3186	m210	ALEX	Someone else did it.
L590928	u3189	m210	ERIN	And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
L590927	u3186	m210	ALEX	Your father gave them to both of you.
L590926	u3189	m210	ERIN	Yeah, no kidding.
L590925	u3186	m210	ALEX	That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
L590924	u3189	m210	ERIN	I know her friends.
L590923	u3186	m210	ALEX	I was a friend of your sister's.
L591354	u3191	m210	MADDEN	You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
L591353	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
L591347	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
L591346	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Doubt is a motherfucker.
L591345	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Just don't believe everything you see.
L591212	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
L591211	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
L591208	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
L591207	u3191	m210	MADDEN	How about sign of a big black bird?
L591206	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Sign of the dead come back to life.
L591205	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Fucking crow.
L591202	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
L591201	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Could say that.
L591200	u3191	m210	MADDEN	They botched the execution.
L591116	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Good for you. You do know something.
L591115	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Guy dressed for Halloween?
L591114	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
L591113	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
L591110	u3191	m210	MADDEN	I know the guy leaves a sign.
L591109	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	You know.
L591108	u3191	m210	MADDEN	I know.
L591107	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
L591106	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Shut up.
L591105	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Yeah, we do.
L591104	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
L591241	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Erin knows, doesn't she?
L591240	u3192	m210	RANDALL	I do. Every day.
L591239	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
L591238	u3192	m210	RANDALL	She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
L591237	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	An accident, Nathan.
L591236	u3192	m210	RANDALL	You killed my daughter.
L591235	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
L591234	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I mean Lauren.
L591233	u3192	m210	RANDALL	You mean Alex.
L591232	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
L590981	u3188	m210	DUTTON	What did I say?
L590980	u3195	m210	TRACY	Look, can I just call a cab?
L590979	u3188	m210	DUTTON	I want you... to bend over.
L590978	u3195	m210	TRACY	You want me to walk a straight line?
L590975	u3195	m210	TRACY	Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
L590974	u3188	m210	DUTTON	If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
L590973	u3195	m210	TRACY	Not tonight. Honest.
L590972	u3188	m210	DUTTON	But you, you've had them.
L590971	u3195	m210	TRACY	She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
L590970	u3188	m210	DUTTON	What's with your friend there?
L590969	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Let's hope not. License and registration please.
L590968	u3195	m210	TRACY	Anything wrong?
L591139	u3189	m210	ERIN	I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
L591138	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Please. Come inside.
L591137	u3189	m210	ERIN	I don't believe you.
L591136	u3192	m210	RANDALL	I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
L591135	u3189	m210	ERIN	Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
L591134	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Sweetheart...
L591133	u3192	m210	RANDALL	About them. You've got to leave it alone.
L591132	u3189	m210	ERIN	About you.
L591131	u3192	m210	RANDALL	They killed her because she found out.
L591130	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
L591129	u3189	m210	ERIN	Stay away from me! Stay away!
L591128	u3192	m210	RANDALL	No.
L591127	u3189	m210	ERIN	You killed her!
L591126	u3192	m210	RANDALL	It's not what you think.
L591125	u3189	m210	ERIN	You're in with them.
L591123	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Looks like you have them both on.
L591122	u3189	m210	ERIN	I think I dropped an earring.
L591039	u3189	m210	ERIN	He said he'd prove it.
L591038	u3192	m210	RANDALL	It still doesn't mean...
L591037	u3189	m210	ERIN	That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
L591036	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
L591035	u3189	m210	ERIN	Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
L591034	u3192	m210	RANDALL	What? What is it?
L591030	u3189	m210	ERIN	The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
L591029	u3192	m210	RANDALL	What is it?
L590940	u3189	m210	ERIN	What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
L590939	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Are you ok?
L590938	u3189	m210	ERIN	This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
L590937	u3192	m210	RANDALL	What were you yelling about?
L590936	u3189	m210	ERIN	Watch out!
L590935	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Erin!
L590920	u3189	m210	ERIN	It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
L590919	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
L590918	u3189	m210	ERIN	Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
L590917	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Honey. I just can't.
L590916	u3189	m210	ERIN	I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
L590830	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Just hold on to me.
L590829	u3189	m210	ERIN	Why are there so many?
L602040	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
L602039	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Where these tracks headed?
L602036	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I know.
L602035	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Dogs don't eat each other.
L602034	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe dinner.
L602032	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Let's load 'em.
L602031	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
L601888	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
L601887	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
L601842	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Just listen.
L601841	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	What do you want from us?
L601795	u3225	m213	MACREADY	And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
L601794	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Sixteen.
L601957	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
L601956	u3221	m213	CLARK	What the hell you looking at me like that for?
L601955	u3221	m213	CLARK	Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
L601954	u3219	m213	BLAIR	How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
L601952	u3219	m213	BLAIR	You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
L601951	u3221	m213	CLARK	Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
L601950	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
L601949	u3221	m213	CLARK	Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
L601948	u3219	m213	BLAIR	What was he doing in the rec room?
L601947	u3221	m213	CLARK	Yeah.
L601946	u3219	m213	BLAIR	That night?
L601945	u3221	m213	CLARK	No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
L601944	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
L601931	u3219	m213	BLAIR	It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
L601930	u3221	m213	CLARK	"What do you mean ""got"" to the dog?"
L601974	u3224	m213	GARRY	I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
L601973	u3219	m213	BLAIR	You can't let anybody leave!
L601972	u3224	m213	GARRY	Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
L601971	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
L601968	u3224	m213	GARRY	If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
L601967	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
L601960	u3219	m213	BLAIR	No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
L601959	u3224	m213	GARRY	Anybody sick?
L601958	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... It could have gotten to somebody...
L601938	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
L601937	u3224	m213	GARRY	So what's our problem?
L601936	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Look, I know it's hard to believe...
L601896	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Maybe.
L601895	u3224	m213	GARRY	Sure.  You think there's a connection?
L601894	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
L601893	u3224	m213	GARRY	Couldn't make much of it myself.
L601890	u3224	m213	GARRY	I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
L601889	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
L602156	u3226	m213	NAULS	You promise?
L602155	u3219	m213	BLAIR	And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
L602154	u3226	m213	NAULS	Now why'd you go and...
L602153	u3226	m213	NAULS	Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
L602152	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
L602151	u3226	m213	NAULS	What you doin'?
L601927	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
L601926	u3226	m213	NAULS	Finish what?
L601925	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
L602223	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We'll see...
L602222	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
L602221	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Have you come across Fuchs?
L602220	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
L602007	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
L602006	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What?
L602005	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Watch Clark.
L602004	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
L602003	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I don't know who to trust.
L602002	u3225	m213	MACREADY	How you doin', old boy?
L601996	u3219	m213	BLAIR	No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
L601995	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
L601994	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
L601991	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
L601990	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Too damn dangerous.
L602287	u3220	m213	CHILDS	No.  Just let him freeze out there.
L602286	u3228	m213	PALMER	He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
L602285	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
L602284	u3228	m213	PALMER	Let's open it.  Now...
L602279	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Hell no.
L602278	u3228	m213	PALMER	Let's open it.
L602268	u3220	m213	CHILDS	If it did get to him.
L602267	u3228	m213	PALMER	Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
L602249	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
L602248	u3228	m213	PALMER	Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
L602243	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now hold on, you dumb...
L602242	u3228	m213	PALMER	We got to burn 'em.
L602241	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What's it going to do, being a plant?
L602240	u3228	m213	PALMER	Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
L602239	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Let go of me...
L602238	u3228	m213	PALMER	Childs!!
L602237	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now who'd go and do...
L602236	u3228	m213	PALMER	Somebody broke in.
L602230	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
L602229	u3228	m213	PALMER	Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
L602216	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Don't walk behind me.
L602215	u3228	m213	PALMER	What?
L602146	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Ain't it there?
L602145	u3228	m213	PALMER	Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
L601912	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cool it, Palmer!!
L601911	u3228	m213	PALMER	Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
L602198	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You lying bastard...
L602197	u3224	m213	GARRY	Was dark... find a light...
L602196	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I said where?  Where'd you go?!
L602107	u3224	m213	GARRY	Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
L602106	u3220	m213	CHILDS	That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
L602105	u3224	m213	GARRY	I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
L601743	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
L601742	u3224	m213	GARRY	You catch anything he was saying?
L602261	u3226	m213	NAULS	When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
L602260	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut him loose?
L602259	u3226	m213	NAULS	Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
L602171	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
L602170	u3226	m213	NAULS	Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
L602167	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Clark, you come on out here!!
L602166	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's shorted out or something!
L602165	u3220	m213	CHILDS	That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
L602164	u3226	m213	NAULS	I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
L602163	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
L602162	u3220	m213	CHILDS	No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
L602161	u3226	m213	NAULS	Childs!  That a fuse?
L602062	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
L602061	u3226	m213	NAULS	Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
L602441	u3225	m213	MACREADY	If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
L602440	u3220	m213	CHILDS	If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
L602439	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe we shouldn't make it.
L602438	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Then we'll never make it.
L602437	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe we shouldn't.
L602436	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
L602435	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Neither will we.
L602434	u3220	m213	CHILDS	The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
L602433	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Not the only one.
L602429	u3220	m213	CHILDS	"What do you mean ""you think so?"""
L602428	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I think so.
L602374	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
L602373	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Spaceship of some kind.
L602358	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
L602357	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Load of bullshit.
L602345	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
L602344	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We should have jumped his ass.
L602338	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Then kill me.
L602337	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then I'll have to kill you.
L602336	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You ain't tying me up.
L602333	u3225	m213	MACREADY	For your health.
L602332	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What for?
L602331	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
L602314	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We ain't buying that.
L602313	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
L602299	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You been made, MacReady.
L602298	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What clothes?
L602297	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
L602296	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
L602295	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you doing?
L602283	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
L602282	u3220	m213	CHILDS	... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
L602212	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
L602211	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Well, who says I want you going with me?!
L602181	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Gee, thanks!
L602180	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
L602179	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Garry's missing!
L602178	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What?
L602177	u3220	m213	CHILDS	MacReady!
L602126	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We got morphine, don't we.
L602125	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What do we do about those three?
L602054	u3225	m213	MACREADY	He's gone already!  Do it!
L602053	u3220	m213	CHILDS	But...
L602052	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Torch them!!
L602051	u3225	m213	MACREADY	How the fuck do I know?!
L602050	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What we going to do?!
L602038	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Probably the next meal.
L602037	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Where's the other half?
L602030	u3225	m213	MACREADY	That's good enough.
L602029	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
L601921	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You buy any of this, Blair?
L601920	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
L601919	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
L601918	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
L601910	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
L601909	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
L601907	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Well, go on.
L601906	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Look, I'm just guessing...
L601905	u3220	m213	CHILDS	MacReady!
L601879	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
L601878	u3220	m213	CHILDS	The dogs?
L601877	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Torch it over there!
L601875	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
L601874	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What's happening?
L602354	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
L602353	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Thank you.
L602352	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I guess you're okay.
L602324	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Damn you, MacReady!
L602323	u3225	m213	MACREADY	And if anyone tries to wake me...
L602321	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Enough, MacReady!
L602320	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
L602319	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Now hold him.
L602097	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I think so.
L602096	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Would that test have worked?
L602094	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I guess I'm the only one.
L602093	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Well, who's got access to it?
L601817	u3225	m213	MACREADY	It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
L601816	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
L601815	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you doing?
L601814	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	All in Norwegian.
L601813	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Anything?
L601807	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
L601806	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Hey, Sweden!!!
L601805	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Come on, Copper.
L601804	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	My God, what in hell happened here?
L601789	u3225	m213	MACREADY	So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
L601788	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
L602084	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, get to it.
L602083	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A couple of hours.
L602082	u3224	m213	GARRY	How long will it take you to prepare this?
L602064	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
L602063	u3224	m213	GARRY	Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
L601844	u3224	m213	GARRY	Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
L601843	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
L601767	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Bennings?
L601766	u3224	m213	GARRY	In this weather?
L601765	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
L601764	u3224	m213	GARRY	Nothing we can do about that.
L601763	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
L602228	u3227	m213	NORRIS	After all this mess.
L602227	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	After all this mess then.
L602226	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
L602225	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
L602104	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A day or so ago... I guess.
L602103	u3227	m213	NORRIS	When was the last time you used it?
L602102	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
L602076	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A serum test possibly.
L602075	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
L602078	u3224	m213	GARRY	What's that?
L602077	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Right.  Why not?
L601761	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
L601760	u3224	m213	GARRY	How many in their party?
L601741	u3224	m213	GARRY	That far?
L601740	u3223	m213	FUCHS	'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
L601739	u3224	m213	GARRY	How far's that?
L601738	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
L602115	u3224	m213	GARRY	I'll put this right through your head.
L602114	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	No.
L602113	u3224	m213	GARRY	Put that down!
L601963	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
L601962	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
L601826	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, stick to it.
L601825	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
L601824	u3224	m213	GARRY	You reach anybody yet?
L601823	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Hey, man...!
L602413	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Little over two hours.
L602412	u3224	m213	GARRY	How long's it been?
L602393	u3224	m213	GARRY	One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
L602392	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Looks good.
L602363	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
L602362	u3224	m213	GARRY	Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
L602335	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Damn if I won't.
L602334	u3224	m213	GARRY	Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
L602101	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Could anyone have gotten it from you?
L602100	u3224	m213	GARRY	Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
L602024	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
L602023	u3224	m213	GARRY	You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
L602022	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
L602019	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I am going after them.
L602018	u3224	m213	GARRY	You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
L601882	u3224	m213	GARRY	Extinguishers.
L601881	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Don't let up, Childs!
L601880	u3224	m213	GARRY	We're on fire!
L601791	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
L601790	u3224	m213	GARRY	Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
L602343	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
L602342	u3228	m213	PALMER	He's dead.
L602341	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Tie up Clark, too.
L602330	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm sure a lot of you already know.
L602329	u3228	m213	PALMER	What kind of test?
L602207	u3228	m213	PALMER	I ain't going with Sanchez.
L602206	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
L602189	u3228	m213	PALMER	Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
L602188	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We going to make it?
L602187	u3228	m213	PALMER	Somebody definitely messed with it.
L602186	u3228	m213	PALMER	Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
L602185	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
L602148	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Move it, Palmer.
L602147	u3228	m213	PALMER	No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
L602087	u3228	m213	PALMER	And that was enough?
L602086	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
L602085	u3228	m213	PALMER	How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
L602026	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
L602025	u3228	m213	PALMER	Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
L601984	u3228	m213	PALMER	Blair.  He's gone berserk.
L601983	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What's...
L601793	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
L601792	u3228	m213	PALMER	Four!
L602387	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
L602386	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	He might just wait us out.
L602382	u3225	m213	MACREADY	It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
L602381	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	What if it doesn't come?
L602205	u3225	m213	MACREADY	If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
L602204	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Why?
L602203	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
L602191	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
L602190	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Where were the flashlights?
L602132	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Can you think of any other tests?
L602131	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
L602416	u3226	m213	NAULS	Bet the last place you ever go.
L602415	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then we go after him.
L602414	u3226	m213	NAULS	Maybe it ain't coming.
L602409	u3226	m213	NAULS	Position, my ass...
L602408	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Calm down and get in your position.
L602407	u3226	m213	NAULS	Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
L602406	u3226	m213	NAULS	Screw the generator!!
L602405	u3225	m213	MACREADY	The generator!
L602404	u3226	m213	NAULS	Get back!!
L602385	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
L602384	u3226	m213	NAULS	You crazy?  He might be inside already?
L602383	u3225	m213	MACREADY	You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
L602379	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Forget about Childs.  He's over.
L602378	u3226	m213	NAULS	What about Childs?
L602376	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Anyplace but here.
L602375	u3226	m213	NAULS	Where was he trying to go?
L602372	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Everything that's been missing.
L602371	u3226	m213	NAULS	What is it?
L602348	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
L602347	u3226	m213	NAULS	What are you going to do?  Drink it?
L602346	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
L602277	u3226	m213	NAULS	Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
L602276	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
L602233	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
L602232	u3226	m213	NAULS	This storm do that?
L602141	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Just keep looking.
L602140	u3226	m213	NAULS	That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
L602176	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Well, let's get down there.
L602175	u3227	m213	NORRIS	It's the generator I think!  No power.
L602174	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Yeah!
L602173	u3227	m213	NORRIS	MacReady, that you?
L602172	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What's happened?!
L602130	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
L602129	u3227	m213	NORRIS	We should sleep in shifts.
L602099	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Who else could have used that key?
L602098	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
L601902	u3225	m213	MACREADY	No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
L601901	u3227	m213	NORRIS	You know damn well what we both make of it.
L601900	u3225	m213	MACREADY	So what do you make of it?
L601899	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
L601785	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What for?
L601784	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Get your gear on.
L601783	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
L601782	u3227	m213	NORRIS	You jerking off or just pissed?
L602399	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Can't hear you.
L602398	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
L602397	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	What?!
L602396	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
L602395	u3226	m213	NAULS	Hear what?
L602394	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	You hear that?
L602266	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	When do you think it got to him?
L602265	u3226	m213	NAULS	He's one of them.
L602264	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	MacReady...?
L602263	u3226	m213	NAULS	... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
L583651	u3243	m215	BECKER	Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
L583650	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	We never should have done this to him...
L583649	u3243	m215	BECKER	Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
L583518	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
L583517	u3243	m215	BECKER	Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
L583516	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Should we be...
L583515	u3243	m215	BECKER	What about Starks?
L583514	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	But... what about Starks?
L583513	u3243	m215	BECKER	Then don't.
L583512	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
L583511	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'm fine.
L583510	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	You ok?
L584055	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
L584054	u3243	m215	BECKER	I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
L584053	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
L584052	u3243	m215	BECKER	I don't understand...
L584051	u3252	m215	STARKS	You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
L584050	u3243	m215	BECKER	How did you come to know their names?
L584046	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, we were patients.
L584045	u3243	m215	BECKER	The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
L584044	u3252	m215	STARKS	So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
L584043	u3243	m215	BECKER	It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
L584042	u3252	m215	STARKS	Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
L584041	u3243	m215	BECKER	Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
L584040	u3243	m215	BECKER	Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
L584039	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L584038	u3243	m215	BECKER	I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
L584037	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
L584036	u3243	m215	BECKER	I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
L584035	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
L584034	u3243	m215	BECKER	No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
L584033	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
L584032	u3243	m215	BECKER	You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
L584031	u3243	m215	BECKER	How...how are you here?
L584030	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
L584029	u3243	m215	BECKER	[Beat] You're his son?
L584028	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
L584027	u3243	m215	BECKER	Who are you?
L583983	u3243	m215	BECKER	You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
L583982	u3252	m215	STARKS	Becker, how do you sleep at night?
L583981	u3243	m215	BECKER	Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
L583980	u3252	m215	STARKS	And what does that mean?
L583979	u3243	m215	BECKER	I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
L583978	u3252	m215	STARKS	You sure you know where to find one?
L583977	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
L583972	u3243	m215	BECKER	You killed him?
L583971	u3252	m215	STARKS	Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
L583970	u3243	m215	BECKER	Yes.
L583969	u3252	m215	STARKS	My business?
L583968	u3243	m215	BECKER	And what's that?
L583966	u3243	m215	BECKER	Temporarily.
L583965	u3252	m215	STARKS	They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
L583964	u3243	m215	BECKER	"It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our ""practices"" off to the New Year."
L583963	u3252	m215	STARKS	That's too bad.
L583962	u3243	m215	BECKER	Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
L583773	u3243	m215	BECKER	Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
L583772	u3252	m215	STARKS	Long live the Organization for the Organized!
L583696	u3243	m215	BECKER	Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
L583695	u3252	m215	STARKS	We are not birds of a feather.
L583692	u3243	m215	BECKER	I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
L583691	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't give a shit about your patient!
L583690	u3243	m215	BECKER	I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
L583689	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
L583688	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
L583687	u3243	m215	BECKER	You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
L583686	u3243	m215	BECKER	[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
L583685	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
L583684	u3243	m215	BECKER	Relax.
L583683	u3243	m215	BECKER	Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
L583682	u3252	m215	STARKS	That wasn't a fucking restraint.
L583681	u3243	m215	BECKER	We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
L583680	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
L583679	u3243	m215	BECKER	In where?
L583678	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
L583658	u3243	m215	BECKER	Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
L583657	u3252	m215	STARKS	Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
L583656	u3243	m215	BECKER	He's recovering on the third floor.
L583466	u3243	m215	BECKER	It's not my job to believe you.
L583465	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
L583464	u3243	m215	BECKER	You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
L583463	u3252	m215	STARKS	Depends on what you're seeing.
L583462	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
L583461	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
L583460	u3243	m215	BECKER	Well, your condition's pretty serious.
L583890	u3244	m215	DAMON	I never touched your father! I swear!
L583889	u3252	m215	STARKS	He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
L583888	u3244	m215	DAMON	I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
L583887	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
L583886	u3244	m215	DAMON	I thought you said you never knew your father.
L583885	u3252	m215	STARKS	That's too bad.
L583884	u3244	m215	DAMON	Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
L583882	u3244	m215	DAMON	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
L583881	u3252	m215	STARKS	My father used to talk about you.
L583878	u3244	m215	DAMON	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
L583877	u3252	m215	STARKS	Did you know my father?
L583876	u3252	m215	STARKS	He didn't either.
L583875	u3244	m215	DAMON	That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
L583874	u3252	m215	STARKS	You may have known my father, William Starks.
L583873	u3244	m215	DAMON	Do I know you from somewhere?
L583749	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
L583748	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
L583747	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	They should just be looking harder.
L583746	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What should they be looking for?
L583745	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
L583744	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
L583743	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Maybe it's not such a waste.
L583742	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
L583741	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	We're late.
L584139	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
L584138	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	No, it hasn't.
L584137	u3252	m215	STARKS	And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
L584136	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	I can't take you out of here in your condition...
L584135	u3252	m215	STARKS	I need to get this letter to someone.
L584134	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Thank you.
L584133	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
L584132	u3252	m215	STARKS	This is really happening, isn't it?
L583499	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good.
L583498	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	Sure.
L583497	u3252	m215	STARKS	You done with your small talk?
L583496	u3252	m215	STARKS	I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
L583495	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
L583814	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
L583813	u3252	m215	STARKS	What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
L583812	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
L583811	u3252	m215	STARKS	What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
L583810	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
L583809	u3252	m215	STARKS	His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
L583808	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
L584162	u3249	m215	JEAN	Just do it.
L584161	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Why?
L584160	u3249	m215	JEAN	Jackie, go play in the snow.
L584157	u3249	m215	JEAN	Oh, yeah.
L584156	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
L584155	u3249	m215	JEAN	I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
L583430	u3249	m215	JEAN	Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
L583429	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Mom, he just fixed our car.
L583428	u3249	m215	JEAN	Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
L584194	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm doing fine.
L584193	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How you doin'?
L584185	u3252	m215	STARKS	I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
L584184	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
L584183	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You're bleeding pretty bad there.
L584182	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think so.
L584171	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok.
L584170	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
L584150	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok, I guess.
L584149	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good. How's your mom?
L584148	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I've been ok.
L584089	u3252	m215	STARKS	Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
L584088	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Then, where are you going?
L584087	u3252	m215	STARKS	You gotta stop thinking like that.
L584086	u3248	m215	JACKIE	112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
L584085	u3252	m215	STARKS	When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
L584084	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What?
L584071	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok. Ssh. Rest.
L584070	u3252	m215	STARKS	Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
L584068	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
L584067	u3252	m215	STARKS	What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
L584065	u3248	m215	JACKIE	To the hospital.
L584064	u3252	m215	STARKS	Where are we going?
L584063	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
L584062	u3252	m215	STARKS	If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
L584059	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
L584058	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, he didn't.
L584057	u3248	m215	JACKIE	That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
L584023	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
L584022	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William, you're not making sense.
L584021	u3252	m215	STARKS	They've got lives to be grateful for.
L584018	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's Sunday.
L584017	u3252	m215	STARKS	Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
L584013	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat] I don't know.
L584012	u3252	m215	STARKS	Then why isn't there anyone around?
L584011	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
L584010	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
L584008	u3252	m215	STARKS	There're no cars on this street.
L584007	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? What are you thinking?
L584004	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat, lost] No.
L584003	u3252	m215	STARKS	They're not.
L584002	u3248	m215	JACKIE	They're not here.
L584001	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
L584000	u3252	m215	STARKS	You're sure?
L583999	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
L583998	u3252	m215	STARKS	Me, too.
L583901	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
L583900	u3252	m215	STARKS	I might not be able to.
L583899	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
L583898	u3252	m215	STARKS	Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
L583897	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
L583896	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
L583894	u3248	m215	JACKIE	They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
L583893	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know.
L583892	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How long do we have?
L583865	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
L583864	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583863	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
L583862	u3252	m215	STARKS	Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
L583861	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You think Lorenson kills you?
L583860	u3252	m215	STARKS	I have no idea.
L583859	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
L583858	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't believe a thing she just said.
L583807	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
L583806	u3252	m215	STARKS	How? Did they figure it out after I died?
L583805	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I know.
L583804	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
L583803	u3252	m215	STARKS	If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
L583802	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
L583801	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know.
L583800	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
L583799	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yes.
L583798	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
L583797	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
L583796	u3252	m215	STARKS	Do you really believe me?
L583795	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
L583794	u3252	m215	STARKS	What?
L583793	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat] You bled to death.
L583792	u3252	m215	STARKS	After I...
L583791	u3248	m215	JACKIE	But no one knew until after...
L583790	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
L583789	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah.
L583788	u3248	m215	JACKIE	The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
L583640	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Please...
L583639	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
L583638	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
L583637	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
L583636	u3252	m215	STARKS	It's December 25th, 1993 today.
L583635	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
L583634	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
L583633	u3252	m215	STARKS	How'd he die?
L583632	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
L583631	u3252	m215	STARKS	I gave you my dog tags.
L583630	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L583629	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I looked it up.
L583628	u3248	m215	JACKIE	His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
L583627	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What?
L583626	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
L583625	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What?
L583624	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
L583623	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
L583622	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
L583621	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Well, you belong in one.
L583620	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
L583619	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
L583618	u3252	m215	STARKS	Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
L583617	u3248	m215	JACKIE	If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
L583616	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
L583615	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
L583441	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
L583440	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think I can remember what's on them.
L583439	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
L583438	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What for?
L583437	u3252	m215	STARKS	Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
L583436	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What're those?
L583435	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
L583434	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You're just gonna walk?
L583426	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah.
L583425	u3252	m215	STARKS	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
L583424	u3248	m215	JACKIE	But I like it I guess.
L583420	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Jackie.
L583419	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What's your name?
L583418	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah, but I don't know what.
L583417	u3252	m215	STARKS	Your mom take anything before this happened?
L583415	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Our car won't start.
L583414	u3252	m215	STARKS	You two ok?
L583413	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
L583851	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
L583850	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
L583838	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I still don't either, even after all these years.
L583837	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't understand.
L583836	u3250	m215	LORENSON	He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
L583835	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How?
L583834	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
L583833	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
L584142	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good.
L584141	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
L584140	u3252	m215	STARKS	You know how to get there?
L584120	u3252	m215	STARKS	You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
L584119	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What are you talking about?
L584118	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
L584117	u3252	m215	STARKS	You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
L584116	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Who told you this?
L584115	u3252	m215	STARKS	"He's having absence [pronounced ""absance""] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly."
L584114	u3252	m215	STARKS	Listen to me. That's all I ask.
L584113	u3250	m215	LORENSON	William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
L584111	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
L584110	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I do believe you...
L584109	u3252	m215	STARKS	You still don't believe me, do you?
L584108	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I'm not gonna let that happen.
L584107	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What for?
L584106	u3252	m215	STARKS	Can I get some paper and something to write with.
L584105	u3252	m215	STARKS	Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
L584104	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
L584097	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You have nothing to fear, William.
L584096	u3252	m215	STARKS	Who...who kills me?
L584095	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Yeah.
L584094	u3252	m215	STARKS	I did?
L584093	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You told me this was how it happened.
L584092	u3252	m215	STARKS	How...how do you know?
L584091	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
L583946	u3252	m215	STARKS	NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
L583945	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
L583944	u3252	m215	STARKS	Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
L583942	u3252	m215	STARKS	You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
L583941	u3250	m215	LORENSON	How do you know about Eugene?
L583939	u3250	m215	LORENSON	William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
L583938	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
L583937	u3250	m215	LORENSON	And how do you know that?
L583936	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
L583935	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Why not?
L583934	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because I don't have time.
L583933	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Why don't you help me?
L583931	u3252	m215	STARKS	Maybe.
L583930	u3250	m215	LORENSON	[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
L583927	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
L583926	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What about the world?
L583925	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
L583924	u3250	m215	LORENSON	The future doesn't look different?
L583923	u3252	m215	STARKS	It doesn't look all that different.
L583922	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
L583920	u3252	m215	STARKS	2004.
L583919	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Well, what time is it?
L583918	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
L583917	u3252	m215	STARKS	Come on. Tell me what you do know.
L583916	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
L583913	u3252	m215	STARKS	This has nothing to do with that.
L583912	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
L583911	u3252	m215	STARKS	You don't understand.
L583909	u3252	m215	STARKS	Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
L583908	u3250	m215	LORENSON	No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
L583907	u3252	m215	STARKS	You have no idea what's going on.
L583906	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What do you mean?
L583903	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll die either way.
L583902	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
L583857	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] We will.
L583856	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
L583855	u3252	m215	STARKS	Exactly.
L583854	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, it is.
L583853	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
L583849	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why would we do that?
L583848	u3250	m215	LORENSON	So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
L583846	u3252	m215	STARKS	My dad wrote some things down before he died.
L583845	u3250	m215	LORENSON	How do you know about Dr. Becker?
L583844	u3252	m215	STARKS	Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
L583843	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
L583842	u3252	m215	STARKS	But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
L583841	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I don't know.
L583840	u3252	m215	STARKS	How'd he get it?
L583831	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I was working with a boy named Eugene.
L583830	u3252	m215	STARKS	What case?
L583828	u3252	m215	STARKS	You thought my father was crazy?
L583827	u3250	m215	LORENSON	At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
L583826	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583825	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
L583824	u3252	m215	STARKS	I never knew my father. Did you?
L583823	u3250	m215	LORENSON	My God you look exactly like him.
L583720	u3252	m215	STARKS	Believe me, I know.
L583719	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
L583718	u3250	m215	LORENSON	So it's helping?
L583717	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. I don't want it to.
L583716	u3252	m215	STARKS	I could try to...make it stop.
L583715	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why, what would you do?
L583711	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
L583710	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
L583709	u3252	m215	STARKS	That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
L583708	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You were convicted of the crime.
L583706	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You're not crazy.
L583705	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because I don't think I'm crazy.
L583704	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I guess I'd ask you why.
L583703	u3252	m215	STARKS	And if I didn't want to come?
L583959	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
L583958	u3252	m215	STARKS	Becker does? Are you sure?
L583957	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
L583956	u3252	m215	STARKS	MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
L583952	u3252	m215	STARKS	Is it true?
L583951	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	"Geez, how's that for a fucking ""thank you""?"
L583740	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
L583739	u3252	m215	STARKS	So what am I supposed to do?
L583738	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
L583737	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583736	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	It's gonna be sticky.
L583732	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
L583731	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
L583730	u3252	m215	STARKS	The Jacket.
L583729	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	[Beat] How do you know?
L583728	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
L583727	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
L583726	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
L583725	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I know you need one when it's really cold.
L583723	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
L583722	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I wasn't talking about anything.
L583721	u3252	m215	STARKS	What were you talking about the other day?
L583484	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
L583483	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
L583481	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
L583480	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't you go to jail for that?
L583479	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I tried to kill my wife.
L583477	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	"TV. Helps numb [makes a ""crazy gesture""] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie."
L583476	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
L583475	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
L584079	u3253	m215	TENNY	Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
L584078	u3252	m215	STARKS	Sure.
L584077	u3253	m215	TENNY	Can you drive?
L584076	u3253	m215	TENNY	I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
L584075	u3252	m215	STARKS	Where are you going?
L584074	u3253	m215	TENNY	Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
L583779	u3252	m215	STARKS	I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
L583778	u3253	m215	TENNY	It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
L583777	u3252	m215	STARKS	No.
L583776	u3253	m215	TENNY	You ever been to jail?
L583608	u3252	m215	STARKS	That when you stopped being a nurse?
L583607	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
L583606	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm sorry.
L583605	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
L583604	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L583603	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
L583602	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
L583601	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	I'm sorry.
L583600	u3252	m215	STARKS	I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
L583599	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	So you never knew your mother?
L583598	u3252	m215	STARKS	They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
L583597	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
L583596	u3252	m215	STARKS	But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
L583595	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You remember it?
L583594	u3252	m215	STARKS	This is a great song.
L583591	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
L583590	u3252	m215	STARKS	You don't think that's crazy?
L583589	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	[Beat] Real is overrated.
L583588	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Why?
L583587	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, good for you.
L583585	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know, but I think part of it's...
L583584	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
L583583	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Why'd you stop?
L583582	u3252	m215	STARKS	Have you always been a waitress?
L583581	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	[Beat] I do it.
L583580	u3252	m215	STARKS	You like it?
L583579	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Yup. That's me.
L583578	u3252	m215	STARKS	So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
L583577	u3252	m215	STARKS	Thanks.
L583576	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	This is pretty good. Considering...
L583575	u3252	m215	STARKS	Sure.
L583574	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You want a drink?
L583573	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
L583572	u3252	m215	STARKS	I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
L583571	u3252	m215	STARKS	The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
L583570	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	What's this?
L583567	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
L583566	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
L583564	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, I'm ok.
L583563	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
L583562	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll manage.
L583561	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
L583560	u3252	m215	STARKS	Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
L583559	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
L583557	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] Not around here.
L583556	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
L583555	u3252	m215	STARKS	No.
L583554	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Do you have a motel or something? Money?
L583553	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I was dropped off.
L583552	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, how'd you get here?
L583548	u3252	m215	STARKS	Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
L583547	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
L583546	u3252	m215	STARKS	"Why ""of course""?"
L583545	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Of course you don't know.
L583544	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
L583543	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, where are you from?
L583542	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't think so.
L583541	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You don't have anywhere to stay?
L583540	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure.
L583536	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
L583535	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure.
L583534	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
L583533	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Thanks.
L583532	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
L583530	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Good.
L583529	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I'm not deaf.
L583528	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
L611301	u3308	m219	RAY	Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
L611300	u3300	m219	CARL	Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
L611288	u3308	m219	RAY	We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
L611287	u3300	m219	CARL	Rug samples.
L611286	u3308	m219	RAY	Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
L611285	u3308	m219	RAY	Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
L611284	u3300	m219	CARL	Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
L611283	u3308	m219	RAY	You're my hero, Carl.
L611282	u3300	m219	CARL	Yeah.
L611280	u3300	m219	CARL	Don't get too attached.
L611279	u3308	m219	RAY	Hey. Nice tie.
L611278	u3300	m219	CARL	Hey.
L611591	u3308	m219	RAY	They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
L611590	u3301	m219	CLEAR MOON	They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.

L611516	u3305	m219	LOOKS TWICE	What are you doing?
L611329	u3302	m219	COOCH	Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
L611328	u3309	m219	TULLY	The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
L611327	u3302	m219	COOCH	It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.

L611366	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.

L612003	u3302	m219	COOCH	Come on, Ray. Come forward.
L611967	u3302	m219	COOCH	No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
L611966	u3308	m219	RAY	We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
L611965	u3302	m219	COOCH	We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
L611964	u3308	m219	RAY	-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
L611963	u3302	m219	COOCH	This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
L611961	u3308	m219	RAY	What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.

L611847	u3308	m219	RAY	Why?
L611846	u3302	m219	COOCH	Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.

L611737	u3308	m219	RAY	Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
L611736	u3302	m219	COOCH	She's that subtle?
L611735	u3308	m219	RAY	"It may have been Maggie's way of saying ""get off my ass."""
L611734	u3302	m219	COOCH	He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
L611733	u3308	m219	RAY	All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
L611732	u3302	m219	COOCH	Bastards...
L611730	u3302	m219	COOCH	And get rid of the dog.

L611725	u3308	m219	RAY	Alright. Alright...
L611724	u3302	m219	COOCH	Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
L611723	u3308	m219	RAY	I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
L611722	u3302	m219	COOCH	Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
L611721	u3308	m219	RAY	I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
L611720	u3302	m219	COOCH	You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
L611719	u3308	m219	RAY	-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --

L611716	u3302	m219	COOCH	Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
L611706	u3308	m219	RAY	Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
L611705	u3302	m219	COOCH	The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
L611644	u3302	m219	COOCH	A long way from home. You be careful out there.
L611643	u3308	m219	RAY	Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
L611641	u3302	m219	COOCH	Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
L611640	u3308	m219	RAY	Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
L611639	u3302	m219	COOCH	Her oil pan is shot.
L611638	u3302	m219	COOCH	Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
L611637	u3308	m219	RAY	Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
L611636	u3302	m219	COOCH	That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
L611631	u3308	m219	RAY	I gave it back to her.
L611630	u3302	m219	COOCH	Let's see it.
L611629	u3308	m219	RAY	She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
L611628	u3308	m219	RAY	"She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. ""What's the FBI really doing here."" Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty."
L611627	u3302	m219	COOCH	What'd she say?
L611509	u3308	m219	RAY	Alright. Alright.
L611508	u3302	m219	COOCH	Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
L611507	u3308	m219	RAY	I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
L611506	u3302	m219	COOCH	Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
L611505	u3308	m219	RAY	They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
L611504	u3302	m219	COOCH	That's right.
L611503	u3308	m219	RAY	White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
L611501	u3302	m219	COOCH	One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
L611500	u3308	m219	RAY	Who is he?
L611498	u3308	m219	RAY	Cooch. You're my hero.

L611494	u3302	m219	COOCH	I got one up on ya.
L611493	u3308	m219	RAY	How'd you know?
L611492	u3302	m219	COOCH	Maisy Blue Legs place?
L611445	u3302	m219	COOCH	Good.
L611444	u3308	m219	RAY	Couldn't sleep.

L611404	u3302	m219	COOCH	No. That's Ray here. Ray...
L611398	u3308	m219	RAY	Beats the hell outta me.
L611397	u3302	m219	COOCH	Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
L611390	u3302	m219	COOCH	I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
L611389	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
L611381	u3302	m219	COOCH	We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
L611380	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
L611372	u3308	m219	RAY	-- a fucking cop.
L611371	u3302	m219	COOCH	Who the fuck is he?
L611370	u3308	m219	RAY	I did.
L611362	u3302	m219	COOCH	Check him out, Ray.
L611361	u3308	m219	RAY	This is a restricted area.
L611357	u3302	m219	COOCH	Ray.
L611356	u3308	m219	RAY	Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
L611355	u3302	m219	COOCH	That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
L611354	u3308	m219	RAY	Six rounds. 357.
L611345	u3302	m219	COOCH	No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
L611344	u3308	m219	RAY	You crashed my file?
L611343	u3302	m219	COOCH	"Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? ""To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests""?"
L611341	u3302	m219	COOCH	Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
L611340	u3308	m219	RAY	Were you in Nam?
L611339	u3302	m219	COOCH	The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
L611338	u3308	m219	RAY	Jesus...
L611337	u3302	m219	COOCH	Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.

L611931	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	So they took care of Leo.
L611930	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
L611929	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
L611928	u3308	m219	RAY	That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.

L611925	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
L611924	u3308	m219	RAY	Jesus. Oil?
L611923	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.

L611920	u3308	m219	RAY	What the hell do you want me to do?!
L611919	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
L611918	u3308	m219	RAY	Yeah. Fitful dreams.
L611917	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
L611916	u3308	m219	RAY	We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
L611915	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I'm a full-blood Oglala.
L611914	u3308	m219	RAY	Sorry.
L611913	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
L611912	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Nothin'. Forget it.
L611911	u3308	m219	RAY	What do you mean?
L611910	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
L611909	u3308	m219	RAY	Well, it was just a dream, I --
L611908	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
L611907	u3308	m219	RAY	At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
L611906	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Where was this?
L611905	u3308	m219	RAY	Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
L611904	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
L611903	u3308	m219	RAY	Do they come in dreams, these visions?
L611901	u3308	m219	RAY	No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
L611900	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
L611899	u3308	m219	RAY	Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
L611898	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You got Jimmy. Let her go.
L611897	u3308	m219	RAY	Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
L611896	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
L611895	u3308	m219	RAY	Crow Horse, listen --
L611894	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
L611765	u3308	m219	RAY	No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
L611764	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
L611763	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
L611762	u3308	m219	RAY	Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
L611760	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
L611759	u3308	m219	RAY	They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
L611758	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Still after Jimmy?
L611757	u3308	m219	RAY	And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
L611756	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
L611755	u3308	m219	RAY	What are you talking about?
L611754	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Not no more.
L611753	u3308	m219	RAY	Cuz you're a cop.
L611752	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Cuz I'm a skin?
L611751	u3308	m219	RAY	Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
L611750	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
L611749	u3308	m219	RAY	Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
L611748	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
L611700	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Likewise.
L611699	u3308	m219	RAY	Take care of yourself, Walter.
L611691	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
L611690	u3308	m219	RAY	I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
L611689	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
L611688	u3308	m219	RAY	It's not real.
L611687	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	What you call myths, we call our history.
L611686	u3308	m219	RAY	Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
L611685	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	What'd you expect to hear?
L611684	u3308	m219	RAY	-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
L611683	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Ray --
L611682	u3308	m219	RAY	Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
L611681	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
L611680	u3308	m219	RAY	Don't tell me: heavy duty.
L611679	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Red Deer Table, Ray.
L611676	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	A what?
L611675	u3308	m219	RAY	I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
L611670	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
L611669	u3308	m219	RAY	Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
L611668	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
L611667	u3308	m219	RAY	The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
L611659	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
L611658	u3308	m219	RAY	That's not solid.
L611657	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
L611656	u3308	m219	RAY	I don't see the connection.
L611655	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
L611654	u3308	m219	RAY	-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
L611653	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
L611650	u3308	m219	RAY	She's your sister?
L611649	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
L611647	u3308	m219	RAY	I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
L611646	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
L611578	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
L611577	u3308	m219	RAY	Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
L611576	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	"He also said ""listen to the water."""
L611575	u3308	m219	RAY	The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
L611574	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
L611573	u3308	m219	RAY	So what?
L611572	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He saw an owl.
L611571	u3308	m219	RAY	And...
L611570	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
L611568	u3308	m219	RAY	Because he was talking to me.
L611567	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Why should I tell you.
L611566	u3308	m219	RAY	What was he saying?
L611564	u3308	m219	RAY	He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
L611563	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He said he doesn't know.
L611562	u3308	m219	RAY	What did he say?
L611556	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
L611555	u3308	m219	RAY	What's he smoke in that?
L611552	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
L611551	u3308	m219	RAY	He knows me?
L611550	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
L611548	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
L611547	u3308	m219	RAY	What did he say?
L611545	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
L611544	u3308	m219	RAY	Why does he wanna see me?
L611543	u3308	m219	RAY	Medicine. As in medicine man?
L611542	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
L611541	u3308	m219	RAY	Let's go.
L611540	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
L611539	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
L611538	u3308	m219	RAY	Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
L611537	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
L611478	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
L611477	u3308	m219	RAY	Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
L611476	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
L611475	u3308	m219	RAY	His spiritual mother...
L611474	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
L611473	u3308	m219	RAY	-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
L611472	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
L611471	u3308	m219	RAY	Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
L611470	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
L611469	u3308	m219	RAY	You've got no jurisdiction.
L611468	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
L611467	u3308	m219	RAY	Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
L611466	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
L611465	u3308	m219	RAY	You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
L611464	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
L611463	u3308	m219	RAY	Bullshit.
L611462	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
L611459	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
L611458	u3308	m219	RAY	Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
L611457	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You're steppin' on sign.
L611456	u3308	m219	RAY	What?!
L611455	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Watch out!
L611454	u3308	m219	RAY	What are you --
L611385	u3308	m219	RAY	After we've completed our investigation.
L611384	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
L611813	u3308	m219	RAY	Great.
L611812	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
L611811	u3308	m219	RAY	What?
L611810	u3308	m219	RAY	NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
L611809	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Your relatives must've taught you something.
L611803	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
L611802	u3308	m219	RAY	I desecrated it?
L611801	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
L611800	u3308	m219	RAY	You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
L611623	u3308	m219	RAY	Move it, Magdelana.
L611622	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
L611621	u3308	m219	RAY	When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
L611620	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Thank you.
L611618	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
L611617	u3308	m219	RAY	Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
L611616	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
L611615	u3308	m219	RAY	A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
L611614	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
L611613	u3308	m219	RAY	Who did?
L611612	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
L611611	u3308	m219	RAY	He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
L611610	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
L611609	u3308	m219	RAY	Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
L611608	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
L611607	u3308	m219	RAY	This Jimmy's?
L611604	u3308	m219	RAY	That's right. Turn around.

L611330	u3309	m219	TULLY	With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --

L611309	u3308	m219	RAY	Mister Tully.
L611308	u3309	m219	TULLY	Ray...
L611890	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
L611889	u3308	m219	RAY	Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
L611886	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
L611885	u3308	m219	RAY	What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
L611884	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
L611883	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
L611882	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
L611881	u3308	m219	RAY	You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
L611880	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
L611879	u3308	m219	RAY	The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
L611878	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
L611877	u3308	m219	RAY	How the hell do you know?
L611876	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	No way. No fuckin' way.
L611875	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
L611874	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
L611873	u3308	m219	RAY	They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
L611872	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
L611871	u3308	m219	RAY	Get up!
L611870	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
L611869	u3308	m219	RAY	Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
L611868	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
L611867	u3308	m219	RAY	Get up out of the chair, Richard.
L611866	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What the fuck you talkin' about?
L611865	u3308	m219	RAY	Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
L611862	u3308	m219	RAY	Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
L611861	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	Washington sent ya. I know that.
L611860	u3308	m219	RAY	No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
L611859	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	You ever try solitary confinement?
L611858	u3308	m219	RAY	Leavenworth a tough joint?
L611857	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
L611856	u3308	m219	RAY	At Sioux Falls Pen?
L611855	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
L611854	u3308	m219	RAY	Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
L611853	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What ya want?
L630743	u3378	m224	COOPER	She is preparing a great abundance of food.
L630742	u3371	m224	ALBERT	You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
L630741	u3378	m224	COOPER	She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
L630740	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Tell me some other things about her.
L630739	u3378	m224	COOPER	Blonde.
L630738	u3371	m224	ALBERT	What color hair will she have?
L630737	u3378	m224	COOPER	A woman.
L630736	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
L630735	u3378	m224	COOPER	Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
L630734	u3371	m224	ALBERT	"You said, ""Teresa Banks"", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?"
L630733	u3378	m224	COOPER	Albert.
L630732	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
L630731	u3378	m224	COOPER	The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
L630730	u3371	m224	ALBERT	Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
L631132	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I want you to kill for me.
L631131	u3390	m224	LAURA	No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
L631130	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I want you to kill for me.
L631129	u3390	m224	LAURA	No.
L631039	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
L631038	u3390	m224	LAURA	Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
L631037	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
L630942	u3390	m224	LAURA	NO! GOD, NO...
L630941	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
L630857	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I want you.
L630856	u3390	m224	LAURA	Go away. I am not talking to you.
L630855	u3372	m224	BOB'S VOICE	I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
L630854	u3390	m224	LAURA	No... No, go away.
L631179	u3390	m224	LAURA	Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
L631178	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Bobby's got it.
L631175	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bobby...
L631174	u3373	m224	BOBBY	We can do it right here.
L631172	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
L631171	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
L631170	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Let's ditch this place and party.
L631169	u3390	m224	LAURA	Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
L631168	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
L631167	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
L631166	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Don't get funny with me again.
L631165	u3390	m224	LAURA	What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
L631164	u3373	m224	BOBBY	No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
L631163	u3390	m224	LAURA	Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
L631162	u3373	m224	BOBBY	The stuff we got last night.
L631161	u3390	m224	LAURA	What was?
L631160	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
L631134	u3390	m224	LAURA	You killed Mike.
L631133	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
L631127	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
L631126	u3373	m224	BOBBY	This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
L631116	u3390	m224	LAURA	Here he comes.
L631115	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Here he comes.
L631045	u3390	m224	LAURA	Don't be late.
L631044	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
L631043	u3390	m224	LAURA	Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
L631042	u3373	m224	BOBBY	It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
L631041	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm nearly out.
L630650	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
L630649	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
L630648	u3390	m224	LAURA	Get lost Bobby.
L630647	u3373	m224	BOBBY	I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
L630646	u3390	m224	LAURA	I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
L630645	u3373	m224	BOBBY	Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
L630487	u3374	m224	CABLE	My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
L630486	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
L630485	u3374	m224	CABLE	We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
L630484	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
L630483	u3374	m224	CABLE	Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
L630482	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
L630481	u3374	m224	CABLE	What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
L630354	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
L630353	u3374	m224	CABLE	It's 4:30. We close at five.
L630352	u3374	m224	CABLE	Out back in our morgue.
L630351	u3379	m224	DESMOND	That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
L630350	u3374	m224	CABLE	A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
L630349	u3379	m224	DESMOND	"Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be ""Federal"". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased."
L630348	u3374	m224	CABLE	You're lucky I am not wasting you.
L630347	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
L630346	u3374	m224	CABLE	"Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a ""J. Edgar"" coming up I think I said, ""So what?"""
L630345	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
L630541	u3375	m224	CARL	Yep, it sure is.
L630540	u3378	m224	COOPER	Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
L630539	u3375	m224	CARL	Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
L630538	u3378	m224	COOPER	Can you tell me what their names were?
L630537	u3375	m224	CARL	An old woman and her grandson.
L630536	u3378	m224	COOPER	Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
L630535	u3375	m224	CARL	A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
L630534	u3378	m224	COOPER	What was here, Mr. Rodd?
L630533	u3375	m224	CARL	God damn, you people are confusing.
L630532	u3378	m224	COOPER	I am going over here.
L630531	u3375	m224	CARL	Well, where are you going?
L630530	u3378	m224	COOPER	I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
L630529	u3375	m224	CARL	That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
L630528	u3378	m224	COOPER	Thank you, Carl.
L630527	u3375	m224	CARL	GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
L630477	u3375	m224	CARL	That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
L630476	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
L630475	u3375	m224	CARL	Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
L630474	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Is there a golf course around here?
L630460	u3375	m224	CARL	That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
L630459	u3379	m224	DESMOND	You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
L630447	u3375	m224	CARL	"No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff ""Not-Quite- Able""... Here's the trailer now."
L630446	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
L630445	u3375	m224	CARL	Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
L630444	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Was there an argument?
L630443	u3375	m224	CARL	Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
L630442	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did she have someone with her?
L630441	u3375	m224	CARL	Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
L630440	u3375	m224	CARL	More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
L630439	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
L630493	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I think I'll take off my badge as well.
L630492	u3376	m224	CLIFF	You try that you little monkey.
L630473	u3379	m224	DESMOND	No you couldn't.
L630472	u3376	m224	CLIFF	Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
L630471	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did you know Teresa Banks?
L630468	u3376	m224	CLIFF	You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
L630467	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
L630466	u3376	m224	CLIFF	Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
L630465	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
L630339	u3376	m224	CLIFF	Oh.
L630338	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
L630303	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
L630302	u3377	m224	COLE	GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
L630299	u3377	m224	COLE	YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
L630298	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Congratulations. I heard about that.
L630294	u3377	m224	COLE	I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
L630293	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Smell something fishy, huh?
L630292	u3377	m224	COLE	GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
L630291	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Okay, Gordon!!!
L630290	u3377	m224	COLE	OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
L630289	u3379	m224	DESMOND	OK, Gordon.
L630288	u3377	m224	COLE	NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
L630287	u3379	m224	DESMOND	OK, Gordon.
L630286	u3377	m224	COLE	CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
L630285	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Yes...
L630603	u3377	m224	COLE	ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
L630602	u3378	m224	COOPER	It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
L630599	u3377	m224	COLE	ALBERT?
L630598	u3378	m224	COOPER	Teresa Banks.
L630597	u3377	m224	COLE	QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
L630593	u3377	m224	COLE	ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
L630592	u3378	m224	COOPER	What?
L630591	u3377	m224	COLE	HE'S GONE.
L630553	u3377	m224	COLE	COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
L630552	u3378	m224	COOPER	Phillip?
L630511	u3377	m224	COLE	COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
L630510	u3378	m224	COOPER	What is it, Gordon?
L630525	u3398	m224	STANLEY	No, sir, we did not.
L630524	u3378	m224	COOPER	And no one found the ring?
L630523	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
L630522	u3378	m224	COOPER	Tell me about the letter.
L630521	u3398	m224	STANLEY	No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
L630520	u3378	m224	COOPER	Stanley, I heard all about it.
L630519	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
L630518	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
L630517	u3378	m224	COOPER	And neither will I.
L630516	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
L630515	u3378	m224	COOPER	I'm up to speed, Stanley.
L630514	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
L630513	u3378	m224	COOPER	Anything else?
L630512	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
L631251	u3393	m224	MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE	You are here and there is no place to go...
L631250	u3378	m224	COOPER	Where am I? And how can I leave?
L631249	u3393	m224	MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE	The later events have never been kept a secret.
L631248	u3378	m224	COOPER	That would indicate that it's the future.
L631247	u3393	m224	MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE	Someone else has it now.
L631246	u3378	m224	COOPER	Where is the ring?
L630392	u3384	m224	JACK	No.  Ask Irene over there.
L630391	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did she ever mention any friends?
L630390	u3384	m224	JACK	No.
L630389	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Ever see her with someone else?
L630388	u3384	m224	JACK	No.
L630387	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Any friends?
L630386	u3384	m224	JACK	Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
L630385	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
L630384	u3384	m224	JACK	He didn't suffer.
L630383	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sorry to hear it.
L630382	u3384	m224	JACK	He's dead -- good and dead.
L630381	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Where's Hap?
L630380	u3384	m224	JACK	Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
L630426	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks.
L630425	u3383	m224	IRENE	Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
L630424	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What do you mean?
L630423	u3383	m224	IRENE	You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
L630411	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks.
L630410	u3383	m224	IRENE	"I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a ""freak accident""."
L630409	u3379	m224	DESMOND	He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
L630406	u3383	m224	IRENE	No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
L630405	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Do you take cocaine, Irene?
L630404	u3383	m224	IRENE	No.
L630403	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
L630402	u3383	m224	IRENE	There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
L630401	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What happened to her?
L630400	u3383	m224	IRENE	Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
L630399	u3383	m224	IRENE	She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
L630398	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
L630397	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Say no more.
L630396	u3383	m224	IRENE	Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
L630395	u3379	m224	DESMOND	How come Jack let's you work here?
L630394	u3383	m224	IRENE	Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
L630501	u3398	m224	STANLEY	We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
L630500	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
L630499	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
L630498	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Faulty wiring.
L630497	u3398	m224	STANLEY	One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
L630490	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
L630489	u3398	m224	STANLEY	"When he says, ""Discussion"", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?"
L630480	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Yes, he is like a clown.
L630479	u3379	m224	DESMOND	He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
L630478	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
L630457	u3398	m224	STANLEY	May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
L630456	u3379	m224	DESMOND	My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
L630455	u3398	m224	STANLEY	She's wearing a ring.
L630454	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Take a look at this.
L630452	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I'll get my kit.
L630451	u3379	m224	DESMOND	You better dust this place, Sam.
L630450	u3379	m224	DESMOND	She must have known someone.
L630449	u3398	m224	STANLEY	She lived alone.
L630432	u3398	m224	STANLEY	In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
L630431	u3379	m224	DESMOND	No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
L630430	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Are you speaking to me in a code?
L630429	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
L630428	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I think that's a good idea.
L630427	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
L630422	u3398	m224	STANLEY	It's not late, it's early. Really early.
L630421	u3379	m224	DESMOND	It's late, Sam.
L630420	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Desmond, it's...
L630378	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
L630377	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
L630376	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
L630375	u3398	m224	STANLEY	"It is a piece of paper with the letter ""T"" imprinted on it. Take a look."
L630374	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What is it?
L630373	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
L630372	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Accidental?
L630370	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Oh.
L630369	u3398	m224	STANLEY	There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
L630366	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Cole said she was 17.
L630365	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
L630364	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
L630363	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Maybe, later we could take a look.
L630362	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I don't know, Sam.
L630361	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
L630360	u3379	m224	DESMOND	That's good.
L630359	u3398	m224	STANLEY	No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
L630358	u3379	m224	DESMOND	That's what I heard.
L630357	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
L630334	u3398	m224	STANLEY	It must be a high priority situation.
L630333	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
L630332	u3398	m224	STANLEY	I see. He does talk loud.
L630331	u3379	m224	DESMOND	He talks loud. And he loves his code.
L630330	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
L630329	u3379	m224	DESMOND	What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
L630328	u3398	m224	STANLEY	What did Gordon's tie mean?
L630327	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
L630326	u3398	m224	STANLEY	A blue rose.
L630325	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
L630324	u3398	m224	STANLEY	The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
L630323	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
L630322	u3398	m224	STANLEY	So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
L630321	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
L630320	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Oh, the uncle is missing.
L630314	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
L630313	u3398	m224	STANLEY	What do you mean?
L630312	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Lil was wearing a sour face.
L630311	u3379	m224	DESMOND	I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
L630310	u3398	m224	STANLEY	How do you figure?
L630309	u3379	m224	DESMOND	We're heading into a difficult situation.
L630308	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Shorthand. Really?
L630307	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Sort of shorthand.
L630306	u3398	m224	STANLEY	Code, I've heard a lot about this.
L630305	u3379	m224	DESMOND	Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
L630304	u3398	m224	STANLEY	That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
L630984	u3390	m224	LAURA	Cause I like it.
L630983	u3380	m224	DONNA	Why do you do it, Laura?
L630982	u3390	m224	LAURA	And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
L630981	u3380	m224	DONNA	But I love you, Laura.
L630980	u3390	m224	LAURA	All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
L630979	u3380	m224	DONNA	Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
L630978	u3390	m224	LAURA	I can't help you there.
L630977	u3380	m224	DONNA	How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
L630976	u3390	m224	LAURA	WE got it back, that's all.
L630975	u3380	m224	DONNA	How did the car get back here?
L630974	u3390	m224	LAURA	What can I tell you?
L630973	u3380	m224	DONNA	I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
L630972	u3390	m224	LAURA	No.
L630971	u3380	m224	DONNA	You're not mad at me?
L630970	u3390	m224	LAURA	I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
L630969	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura, I am your friend.
L630968	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, you should forget about last night.
L630967	u3380	m224	DONNA	I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
L630950	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not you, Donna, not you.
L630949	u3380	m224	DONNA	I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
L630948	u3390	m224	LAURA	Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
L630947	u3380	m224	DONNA	Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
L630946	u3390	m224	LAURA	Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
L630910	u3390	m224	LAURA	YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
L630909	u3380	m224	DONNA	No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
L630907	u3390	m224	LAURA	Nothing.
L630906	u3380	m224	DONNA	What are you doing?
L630890	u3390	m224	LAURA	Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
L630889	u3380	m224	DONNA	If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
L630888	u3380	m224	DONNA	Dancing.
L630887	u3390	m224	LAURA	You mean Fred and Ginger?
L630886	u3380	m224	DONNA	Where are the Cookies?
L630885	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
L630884	u3390	m224	LAURA	Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
L630883	u3380	m224	DONNA	Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
L630882	u3390	m224	LAURA	No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
L630881	u3380	m224	DONNA	Where are you going?
L630807	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, you're the muffin.
L630806	u3380	m224	DONNA	Goodbye, Muffin.
L630789	u3390	m224	LAURA	Donna, you are a muffin.
L630788	u3380	m224	DONNA	You want a muffin?
L630787	u3390	m224	LAURA	If I can smoke it.
L630786	u3380	m224	DONNA	This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
L630785	u3390	m224	LAURA	Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
L630784	u3380	m224	DONNA	I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
L630783	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, I want to smoke.
L630782	u3380	m224	DONNA	Do you want to talk?
L630781	u3390	m224	LAURA	You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
L630780	u3380	m224	DONNA	Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
L630779	u3390	m224	LAURA	Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
L630778	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
L630777	u3390	m224	LAURA	I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
L630776	u3380	m224	DONNA	What is it Laura? What's wrong?
L630775	u3380	m224	DONNA	Of course...
L630774	u3390	m224	LAURA	Donna, are you my best friend?
L630773	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura?
L630672	u3380	m224	DONNA	Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
L630671	u3390	m224	LAURA	Sure. What do you want me to call you?
L630670	u3380	m224	DONNA	Call me.
L630669	u3390	m224	LAURA	Okay, I suppose I should go home.
L630668	u3380	m224	DONNA	Maybe I better start our homework.
L630667	u3390	m224	LAURA	Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
L630666	u3380	m224	DONNA	Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
L630664	u3390	m224	LAURA	James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
L630663	u3380	m224	DONNA	Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
L630662	u3390	m224	LAURA	Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
L630661	u3380	m224	DONNA	"Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that ""lasting love""... ""true love""."
L630660	u3390	m224	LAURA	Well, why not?
L630659	u3380	m224	DONNA	Oh god, Laura.
L630658	u3390	m224	LAURA	Maybe.
L630657	u3380	m224	DONNA	You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
L630656	u3390	m224	LAURA	Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
L630655	u3380	m224	DONNA	Are you going to see James tonight?
L630628	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
L630627	u3380	m224	DONNA	Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
L630626	u3390	m224	LAURA	You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
L630625	u3380	m224	DONNA	You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
L630624	u3390	m224	LAURA	I don't know what to do.
L630623	u3380	m224	DONNA	"Are you going to tell him about that ""someone else""?"
L630622	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
L630621	u3380	m224	DONNA	Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
L630620	u3390	m224	LAURA	He probably wanted to drive over.
L630619	u3380	m224	DONNA	The usual, 9:15.
L630618	u3390	m224	LAURA	When?
L630617	u3380	m224	DONNA	James called me last night looking for you.
L630616	u3390	m224	LAURA	Thanks.
L630615	u3380	m224	DONNA	You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
L630614	u3390	m224	LAURA	Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
L630613	u3380	m224	DONNA	Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
L630612	u3390	m224	LAURA	Noooo...
L630611	u3380	m224	DONNA	You didn't do your homework?
L630610	u3390	m224	LAURA	If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
L631111	u3381	m224	ED	Brother, I hear you talkin'.
L631110	u3395	m224	PETE	Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
L631108	u3395	m224	PETE	Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
L631107	u3381	m224	ED	I did? I didn't see anything.
L631106	u3395	m224	PETE	You missed somethin', Ed.
L631105	u3395	m224	PETE	Yep...  Yes...  It is.
L631104	u3381	m224	ED	Nice night.
L631103	u3395	m224	PETE	I haven't got it yet.
L631102	u3381	m224	ED	You got it.
L631101	u3395	m224	PETE	Fill 'er up.
L631100	u3381	m224	ED	What'll it be?
L631099	u3395	m224	PETE	Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
L631098	u3381	m224	ED	"You know what that Big ""E"" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm."
L631097	u3395	m224	PETE	"No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big ""E"" starin' at me."
L631096	u3381	m224	ED	Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
L630704	u3382	m224	HAROLD	I'm so sorry, Laura.
L630703	u3390	m224	LAURA	He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
L630702	u3382	m224	HAROLD	What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
L630701	u3382	m224	HAROLD	But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
L630700	u3390	m224	LAURA	I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
L630699	u3382	m224	HAROLD	Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
L630698	u3390	m224	LAURA	You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
L630693	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, yes... yes...
L630692	u3382	m224	HAROLD	No... No...
L630691	u3390	m224	LAURA	He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
L630690	u3382	m224	HAROLD	What does Bob say?
L630689	u3390	m224	LAURA	The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
L630688	u3390	m224	LAURA	"Bob is real. He's been ""having"" me since I was 12."
L630687	u3382	m224	HAROLD	Maybe.
L630686	u3390	m224	LAURA	The pages are gone. That's real.
L630685	u3382	m224	HAROLD	But Bob isn't real.
L630684	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bob.
L630683	u3382	m224	HAROLD	Who would do that?
L630682	u3390	m224	LAURA	My secret diary. There are pages missing.
L631146	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Send me a kiss.
L631145	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
L631144	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
L631143	u3390	m224	LAURA	I already made you two tapes.
L631142	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Did you make me a tape?
L631141	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm not.
L631140	u3385	m224	JACOBY	A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
L631139	u3390	m224	LAURA	I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
L631138	u3385	m224	JACOBY	Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
L631228	u3390	m224	LAURA	Let's go all the way.
L631227	u3386	m224	JACQUES	We're on our way, Baby.
L631226	u3390	m224	LAURA	Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
L631225	u3386	m224	JACQUES	Right on time, baby.
L630935	u3386	m224	JACQUES	But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
L630934	u3390	m224	LAURA	What? She asked about my father?
L630933	u3386	m224	JACQUES	That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
L630919	u3386	m224	JACQUES	And what a muffin you have.
L630918	u3390	m224	LAURA	I am The Muffin.
L630917	u3386	m224	JACQUES	"No ""Jacques"". I am the Great Went."
L630916	u3390	m224	LAURA	Hey, Jacques...
L630915	u3386	m224	JACQUES	Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
L631218	u3390	m224	LAURA	Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
L631217	u3387	m224	JAMES	See what?
L631216	u3390	m224	LAURA	You want to see...
L631215	u3387	m224	JAMES	What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
L631214	u3390	m224	LAURA	Bobby killed a guy.
L631213	u3387	m224	JAMES	What?
L631212	u3390	m224	LAURA	When he finds out.
L631211	u3387	m224	JAMES	What?
L631210	u3390	m224	LAURA	Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
L631209	u3390	m224	LAURA	I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
L631208	u3387	m224	JAMES	Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
L631207	u3390	m224	LAURA	You mean the ones you pity.
L631206	u3387	m224	JAMES	You always hurt the ones you love.
L631205	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, Laura...
L631204	u3387	m224	JAMES	Oh, Laura.
L631203	u3390	m224	LAURA	Everything, but everything.
L631202	u3387	m224	JAMES	What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
L631201	u3390	m224	LAURA	You know it and I know it.
L631200	u3387	m224	JAMES	What do you mean?
L631199	u3390	m224	LAURA	That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
L631198	u3387	m224	JAMES	What the hell is wrong with you?
L631053	u3390	m224	LAURA	I just can't, James. I can't do it.
L631052	u3387	m224	JAMES	What's going on?
L631051	u3390	m224	LAURA	I can't tonight.
L631050	u3387	m224	JAMES	What about tonight?
L631049	u3390	m224	LAURA	Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
L631048	u3387	m224	JAMES	This afternoon?
L631047	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not now.
L631046	u3387	m224	JAMES	I've got to see you.
L630848	u3387	m224	JAMES	When am I going to see you?
L630847	u3390	m224	LAURA	James...
L630846	u3387	m224	JAMES	You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
L630845	u3390	m224	LAURA	How can I be together if I'm not together?
L630844	u3387	m224	JAMES	We were supposed to be together.
L630843	u3390	m224	LAURA	You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
L630842	u3387	m224	JAMES	Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
L630643	u3390	m224	LAURA	Gobble, gobble, gobble.
L630642	u3387	m224	JAMES	You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
L630641	u3390	m224	LAURA	James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
L630640	u3387	m224	JAMES	It does matter. We're in love.
L630639	u3390	m224	LAURA	No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
L630638	u3387	m224	JAMES	Why? It does.
L630637	u3390	m224	LAURA	Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
L630636	u3387	m224	JAMES	Laura, do you love me?
L630634	u3390	m224	LAURA	Okay.
L630633	u3387	m224	JAMES	Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
L630632	u3390	m224	LAURA	James...
L631081	u3391	m224	LELAND	They were looking for wood.
L631080	u3388	m224	JERRY	History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
L631077	u3388	m224	JERRY	Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
L631076	u3391	m224	LELAND	Trees?
L631075	u3388	m224	JERRY	You're getting warmer.
L631074	u3391	m224	LELAND	Sex?
L631073	u3388	m224	JERRY	You'd think so.
L631072	u3391	m224	LELAND	Eating?
L631071	u3388	m224	JERRY	No.
L631070	u3391	m224	LELAND	Hiking?
L631069	u3388	m224	JERRY	No.
L631068	u3391	m224	LELAND	Boating?
L631067	u3388	m224	JERRY	Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
L630966	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	We throw away the whole head.
L630965	u3389	m224	JOSIE	I understand.
L630964	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
L630963	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
L630962	u3389	m224	JOSIE	Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
L630961	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
L630960	u3389	m224	JOSIE	Fish eyes?
L630959	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
L630958	u3389	m224	JOSIE	I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
L630957	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	What are you afraid of? What people think?
L630956	u3389	m224	JOSIE	That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
L630955	u3400	m224	TRUMAN	Josie, I think we should go public.
L631194	u3396	m224	SARAH	Good night, sweetheart.
L631193	u3390	m224	LAURA	Good night, Mom.
L631155	u3396	m224	SARAH	It's a school night... back by nine.
L631154	u3390	m224	LAURA	If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
L631153	u3396	m224	SARAH	Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
L631152	u3390	m224	LAURA	Where's Dad?
L631151	u3396	m224	SARAH	Sure you do, it's good for you.
L631150	u3390	m224	LAURA	I hate asparagus.
L630862	u3390	m224	LAURA	Mom, take it easy.
L630861	u3396	m224	SARAH	My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
L630860	u3390	m224	LAURA	Mom... what are you wearing?
L630859	u3396	m224	SARAH	Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
L630712	u3396	m224	SARAH	Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
L630711	u3390	m224	LAURA	I'm sorry, Mom.
L630710	u3396	m224	SARAH	Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
L630709	u3390	m224	LAURA	I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
L630708	u3396	m224	SARAH	I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
L630707	u3390	m224	LAURA	What were you doing in my room?
L630706	u3396	m224	SARAH	You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
L630679	u3390	m224	LAURA	What?
L630678	u3396	m224	SARAH	Laura.
L630677	u3390	m224	LAURA	I forgot my books at school.
L630676	u3396	m224	SARAH	Sure honey, what's the hurry?
L630675	u3390	m224	LAURA	Can I take the car?
L631239	u3390	m224	LAURA	NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
L631238	u3391	m224	LELAND	I always thought you knew it was me.
L631237	u3390	m224	LAURA	NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
L631236	u3391	m224	LELAND	DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
L631149	u3390	m224	LAURA	Stay away from me.
L631148	u3391	m224	LELAND	Laura. What's wrong this morning?
L631024	u3390	m224	LAURA	I was down the street.
L631023	u3391	m224	LELAND	You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
L631022	u3390	m224	LAURA	Oh, I thought I saw you.
L631021	u3391	m224	LELAND	No.
L631020	u3390	m224	LAURA	Did you come home during the day last week?
L631019	u3391	m224	LELAND	Yes.
L631018	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad?
L631017	u3391	m224	LELAND	Yes.
L631016	u3390	m224	LAURA	Are you sure you're okay?
L631013	u3391	m224	LELAND	Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
L631012	u3390	m224	LAURA	Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
L631011	u3391	m224	LELAND	We're late to get to your mother.
L631010	u3390	m224	LAURA	No.
L631009	u3391	m224	LELAND	No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
L631008	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
L630852	u3391	m224	LELAND	A special friend?
L630851	u3390	m224	LAURA	A friend from school.
L630850	u3391	m224	LELAND	Who was that?
L630818	u3391	m224	LELAND	Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
L630817	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad...
L630816	u3391	m224	LELAND	Let me see.
L630814	u3390	m224	LAURA	Not really.
L630813	u3391	m224	LELAND	Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
L630812	u3390	m224	LAURA	...school's fine...
L630811	u3391	m224	LELAND	School?
L630810	u3390	m224	LAURA	Fine.
L630809	u3391	m224	LELAND	Hi, honey, how's Donna?
L630718	u3390	m224	LAURA	But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
L630717	u3391	m224	LELAND	"The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, ""Hello, my name is Leland Palmer""."
L630716	u3391	m224	LELAND	Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
L630715	u3390	m224	LAURA	Dad.
L630832	u3391	m224	LELAND	Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
L630831	u3396	m224	SARAH	Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
L630830	u3391	m224	LELAND	How do you know what she doesn't like?
L630829	u3396	m224	SARAH	Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
L630828	u3391	m224	LELAND	Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
L630827	u3396	m224	SARAH	How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
L630826	u3391	m224	LELAND	Bobby didn't give you this?
L630825	u3396	m224	SARAH	They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
L630824	u3391	m224	LELAND	Did you get this from your lover?
L630822	u3391	m224	LELAND	Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
L630821	u3396	m224	SARAH	Leland...
L630820	u3391	m224	LELAND	Look at this finger here.
L630819	u3396	m224	SARAH	Leland, what are you doing?
L630720	u3391	m224	LELAND	This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
L630719	u3396	m224	SARAH	Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
L630714	u3396	m224	SARAH	Oh, Leland.
L630713	u3391	m224	LELAND	"Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  ""I'm hungry""."
L631015	u3391	m224	LELAND	Nothing, I chickened out.
L631014	u3399	m224	TERESA	What's wrong?
L631007	u3391	m224	LELAND	That's right.
L631006	u3399	m224	TERESA	I don't know.
L631005	u3391	m224	LELAND	Who am I?
L631004	u3399	m224	TERESA	What are you doing?
L631003	u3399	m224	TERESA	I can arrange that. I like that.
L631002	u3391	m224	LELAND	Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
L631001	u3399	m224	TERESA	When's the next business trip, big fella?
L630872	u3392	m224	LEO	What did you say?
L630871	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
L630870	u3392	m224	LEO	I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
L630869	u3397	m224	SHELLY	As if I didn't know.
L630868	u3392	m224	LEO	That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
L630867	u3392	m224	LEO	Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
L630866	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Lay off the bennies, Leo.
L630865	u3392	m224	LEO	Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
L630764	u3394	m224	NORMA	Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
L630763	u3397	m224	SHELLY	"If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the ""Meals on Wheels""."
L630762	u3394	m224	NORMA	Come back as soon as you can.
L630761	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Norma, are you alright?
L630760	u3394	m224	NORMA	There's no one here.
L630759	u3397	m224	SHELLY	You're right. There's no one here.
L630758	u3394	m224	NORMA	What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
L630757	u3397	m224	SHELLY	Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
L630746	u3394	m224	NORMA	You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
L630745	u3397	m224	SHELLY	I'm kind of busy, Norma.
L630744	u3394	m224	NORMA	"Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the ""Meals on Wheels""?"
L646629	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like weird calls, by any chance?
L646628	u3439	m227	BOB	I don't follow.
L646627	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
L646626	u3439	m227	BOB	I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
L646625	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
L646624	u3439	m227	BOB	We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
L646623	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes, but...
L646622	u3439	m227	BOB	I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
L646621	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What?
L646620	u3439	m227	BOB	Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
L646618	u3439	m227	BOB	I'm sure we can match any offer.
L646617	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And I...I've got other things happening.
L646616	u3439	m227	BOB	Come on.  Kids love horror.
L646615	u3443	m227	HEATHER	So I don't know about horror.
L646614	u3439	m227	BOB	So?
L646613	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
L646612	u3439	m227	BOB	Sort of a trial balloon.
L646611	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You mean that was a...
L646610	u3439	m227	BOB	He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
L646609	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Can I read it?
L646608	u3439	m227	BOB	He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
L646607	u3443	m227	HEATHER	The nightmares.
L646606	u3439	m227	BOB	He's very excited about it.
L646605	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Which means he's having nightmares again?
L646604	u3439	m227	BOB	Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
L646603	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
L646602	u3439	m227	BOB	We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
L646601	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
L646659	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
L646658	u3440	m227	CHASE	I'll be there in three hours.
L646657	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.
L646656	u3440	m227	CHASE	Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
L646655	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
L646654	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather, has there been another call?
L646653	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like Freddy.
L646652	u3440	m227	CHASE	Like what?
L646651	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
L646650	u3440	m227	CHASE	What?  What kind of episode?
L646649	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He's had some sort of...episode.
L646647	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase, it's Dylan!
L646646	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
L646645	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase, you'd better come home.
L646644	u3440	m227	CHASE	What's up?
L646643	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase. Hi...
L646642	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather?
L646505	u3440	m227	CHASE	48 hours.  Back before you know it.
L646504	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Guess so.
L646503	u3440	m227	CHASE	I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
L646502	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Just be careful, okay?
L646501	u3440	m227	CHASE	You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
L646500	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
L646499	u3440	m227	CHASE	Maybe you should tell me your dream.
L646498	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What if it isn't over?
L646497	u3440	m227	CHASE	Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
L646496	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, you don't.
L646495	u3440	m227	CHASE	You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
L646494	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
L646491	u3440	m227	CHASE	Hasn't been another call, has there?
L646490	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
L646489	u3440	m227	CHASE	Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
L646486	u3443	m227	HEATHER	More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
L646485	u3440	m227	CHASE	You get any sleep last night?
L646484	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
L646481	u3440	m227	CHASE	I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
L646480	u3443	m227	HEATHER	One of mom's cups got broken.
L646475	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No biggie, really.
L646474	u3440	m227	CHASE	Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
L646460	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase...
L646459	u3440	m227	CHASE	Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
L646950	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
L646949	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	What?
L646948	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
L646947	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
L646942	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
L646941	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
L646940	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want my kid out of here now!
L646920	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
L646919	u3443	m227	HEATHER	DO you mind...
L646897	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Everything is not fine!
L646896	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
L646895	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He was just here!
L646894	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
L646884	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
L646883	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Doctor...
L646875	u3443	m227	HEATHER	They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
L646874	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	These look quite fresh.
L646873	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
L646872	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
L646868	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Oh my God...
L646867	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
L646866	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Is he all right?
L646865	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
L646808	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
L646807	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like what?
L646806	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Absolutely.
L646805	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Does he have to stay here over night?
L646801	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No...
L646800	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
L646799	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.
L646798	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Diabetes?
L646797	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.
L646796	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Any history of epilepsy in your family?
L647002	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Read me some?
L647001	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
L647000	u3442	m227	DYLAN	A story?
L646999	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What...what is that?
L646998	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Here.
L646997	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, where's the man?
L646972	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Coming for you...
L646971	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
L646916	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
L646915	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
L646913	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
L646912	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Right 'cross the freeway.
L646911	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
L646909	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
L646908	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
L646907	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You okay, champ?
L646814	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Home, that's right.
L646813	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Home.
L646744	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Can you come with me in my dreams?
L646743	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
L646742	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Why does God let there be bad things?
L646741	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
L646740	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Do you have to die to see God?
L646736	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
L646735	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And...what's the man doing?
L646734	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
L646733	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Your bed?
L646732	u3442	m227	DYLAN	In my bed.
L646727	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
L646726	u3442	m227	DYLAN	I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
L646691	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Not sleepy.
L646690	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
L646689	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
L646688	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
L646683	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Right.
L646682	u3442	m227	DYLAN	He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
L646681	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He's on his way.
L646680	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Don't let the bedbugs bite.
L646679	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
L646676	u3442	m227	DYLAN	The mean old man with the claws.
L646675	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Who?
L646673	u3443	m227	HEATHER	They were safe and could sleep.
L646672	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe.
L646670	u3442	m227	DYLAN	No.  Tonight.  It's important!
L646669	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Tomorrow night.
L646668	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Say how they find their way back home.
L646667	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Time for sleep.
L646664	u3442	m227	DYLAN	I like this story.
L646663	u3443	m227	HEATHER	This is going to give you nightmares.
L646662	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Finish, please!
L646661	u3443	m227	HEATHER	...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside.  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
L646638	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Rex?  Who's Rex?
L646637	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Rex saved me.
L646550	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Bye.
L646549	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
L646511	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What?
L646510	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Someone's coming.
L646488	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
L646487	u3442	m227	DYLAN	You going away?
L646473	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You have a fever, sweetie?
L646472	u3442	m227	DYLAN	no.
L646784	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
L646783	u3443	m227	HEATHER	When do you think it'll be done?
L646782	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
L646781	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
L646780	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Call it a guess...
L646779	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yeah...how'd you know?
L646778	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Darker.  More...evil?
L646775	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
L646774	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
L646773	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
L646772	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Heather?  You doing okay?
L646577	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
L646576	u3443	m227	HEATHER	In what, a romantic comedy?
L646574	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
L646573	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
L646572	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I'm fine.
L646571	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	You okay?
L646970	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Yeah, sure.
L646969	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Fred Krueger did it.
L646968	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	What are you talking about?
L646967	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know how Chase really died.
L646963	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
L646962	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Holy...
L646956	u3443	m227	HEATHER	John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
L646955	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You're right.  That sounds crazy!
L646954	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
L646953	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You got it.  What's happening?
L646952	u3443	m227	HEATHER	John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
L646951	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
L646766	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You really think Dylan's okay?
L646765	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
L646764	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Really?
L646763	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
L646762	u3443	m227	HEATHER	A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
L646761	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Steady...
L646760	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Freddy, for all I know.
L646759	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
L646758	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I've never mentioned it to him.
L646757	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
L646756	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
L646755	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Seemed, not was.
L646754	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
L646753	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You didn't jump in.
L646752	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
L646751	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You're not crazy, by the way.
L646747	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
L646746	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
L646722	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
L646721	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What...happened?
L646706	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want to see for myself.
L646705	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
L646704	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want to see the body.
L646697	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
L646696	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.
L646695	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	Is Chase Porter your husband?
L646694	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes?
L646693	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	Heather Langenkamp?
L646532	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I just can't.
L646531	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	Listen, dammit.
L646530	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I'm sorry, I can't.
L646529	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	You're kidding, right?
L646528	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
L646527	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	The car's no there yet?
L646526	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
L646525	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	Studio B.
L646864	u3447	m227	JULIE	They wouldn't let me...
L646863	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
L646641	u3447	m227	JULIE	Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
L646640	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
L646553	u3447	m227	JULIE	'S okay.
L646552	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
L646551	u3447	m227	JULIE	I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
L646522	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
L646521	u3447	m227	JULIE	Heather, what is it?
L646515	u3447	m227	JULIE	Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
L646514	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
L646855	u3451	m227	WES	Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
L646854	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Choice?  What kind of choice?
L646853	u3451	m227	WES	The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
L646852	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
L646851	u3451	m227	WES	Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
L646850	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
L646849	u3451	m227	WES	But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
L646848	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That was Nancy, not me!
L646847	u3451	m227	WES	Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
L646846	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Me?  Why me?
L646845	u3451	m227	WES	Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
L646844	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
L646843	u3451	m227	WES	Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
L646842	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Then what is he doing?
L646841	u3451	m227	WES	That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
L646840	u3443	m227	HEATHER	If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
L646839	u3451	m227	WES	Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
L646838	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
L646837	u3451	m227	WES	Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
L646836	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like the Genie in the bottle.
L646835	u3451	m227	WES	By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
L646834	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Captured?  How?
L646833	u3451	m227	WES	It can be captured, sometimes.
L646832	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
L646831	u3451	m227	WES	I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
L646830	u3443	m227	HEATHER	This is still a script we're talking about, right?
L646829	u3451	m227	WES	Killing innocence, one way or the other.
L646828	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What's that?
L646827	u3451	m227	WES	I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
L646569	u3445	m227	HOST	Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
L646568	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Robert?  I...
L646567	u3445	m227	HOST	And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
L646566	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
L646564	u3443	m227	HEATHER	My child?  No...but...
L646563	u3445	m227	HOST	Do you let your child watch your movies?
L646562	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, not really.  I...
L646561	u3445	m227	HOST	Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
L646560	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
L646597	u3450	m227	SARA	Me too.
L646596	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Black's fine.
L646595	u3450	m227	SARA	Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
L646594	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Coffee'd be nice.
L646593	u3450	m227	SARA	Can I get you something to drink?
L646586	u3450	m227	SARA	Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
L646585	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Now?
L646584	u3450	m227	SARA	No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
L646583	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Uh...sure...when?
L646582	u3450	m227	SARA	Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
L646581	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
L646580	u3450	m227	SARA	Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
L646579	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes?
L10778	u3529	m233	ANNA	There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
L10777	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
L10776	u3529	m233	ANNA	I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
L10775	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But you just said that a month was too...
L10774	u3529	m233	ANNA	No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
L10773	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
L10772	u3529	m233	ANNA	In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
L10771	u3545	m233	SANDRO	There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
L10770	u3529	m233	ANNA	But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
L10769	u3545	m233	SANDRO	So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
L10768	u3529	m233	ANNA	A little more so this time.
L10767	u3545	m233	SANDRO	You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
L10766	u3529	m233	ANNA	Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
L10707	u3529	m233	ANNA	Wait for what?
L10706	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
L10704	u3529	m233	ANNA	Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
L10703	u3545	m233	SANDRO	How are you?
L10668	u3545	m233	SANDRO	What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
L10667	u3529	m233	ANNA	I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
L10666	u3545	m233	SANDRO	What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
L10665	u3529	m233	ANNA	Then how come you're not with him?
L10664	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
L10663	u3529	m233	ANNA	When do you have to go back?
L10621	u3529	m233	ANNA	She'll wait.
L10620	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But your friend is waiting downstairs.
L10714	u3529	m233	ANNA	We'll send the raft back to you.
L10713	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm certainly not going to swim across.
L10712	u3529	m233	ANNA	Claudia, aren't you coming?
L10696	u3529	m233	ANNA	Then why don't you try it on?
L10695	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	This one is gorgeous.
L10694	u3529	m233	ANNA	Which one shall I wear?
L10638	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
L10637	u3529	m233	ANNA	Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
L10636	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Did you sleep well?
L10614	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	What! After giving us such a run around...
L10613	u3529	m233	ANNA	You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
L10612	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
L10611	u3529	m233	ANNA	I'm thirsty.
L10610	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	But where are you going?
L10606	u3535	m233	FATHER	It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
L10605	u3529	m233	ANNA	Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
L10603	u3529	m233	ANNA	You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
L10602	u3535	m233	FATHER	You already know what they are.
L10601	u3529	m233	ANNA	And have you any other truths to tell me?
L10600	u3535	m233	FATHER	Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
L10599	u3529	m233	ANNA	But how could you say such a thing?
L10598	u3535	m233	FATHER	To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
L10597	u3529	m233	ANNA	Used to what?
L10596	u3535	m233	FATHER	Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
L10595	u3529	m233	ANNA	Four or five days.
L10594	u3535	m233	FATHER	And how long will you be away?
L10593	u3529	m233	ANNA	No, Dad, it isn't.
L10592	u3535	m233	FATHER	Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
L10919	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
L10918	u3530	m233	ANNA'S FATHER	This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
L10914	u3530	m233	ANNA'S FATHER	I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
L10913	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
L10912	u3530	m233	ANNA'S FATHER	Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
L10911	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
L10910	u3530	m233	ANNA'S FATHER	I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
L10906	u3531	m233	CARABINIERE	As you wish.
L10905	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
L10904	u3531	m233	CARABINIERE	But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
L10903	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
L10902	u3531	m233	CARABINIERE	It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
L10901	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
L10900	u3531	m233	CARABINIERE	These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
L10894	u3531	m233	CARABINIERE	It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
L10893	u3545	m233	SANDRO	It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
L10829	u3533	m233	CORRADO	What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
L10828	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Maybe you'd better ask him.
L10827	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
L10799	u3533	m233	CORRADO	But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
L10798	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Somebody must live here!
L10765	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
L10764	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	There's no comparison.
L10763	u3533	m233	CORRADO	More so than the shark?
L10762	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
L10761	u3533	m233	CORRADO	That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
L10760	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	How wonderful!
L10745	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
L10744	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Have you decided?
L10743	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Well, what?
L10742	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Well?
L10739	u3533	m233	CORRADO	At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
L10738	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	At what?
L10737	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
L10646	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
L10645	u3533	m233	CORRADO	That must be Basiluzzo.
L10644	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	What is that one over there called?
L11313	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I deserve it.
L11312	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I don't love you.
L11311	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Tell me once more.
L11310	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I love you.
L11309	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Good night. Tell me that you love me.
L11308	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Good night, my love.
L11304	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Late, very late.
L11303	u3545	m233	SANDRO	You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
L11302	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
L11301	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm too sleepy.
L11300	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Why?
L11299	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Sandro, I'm not coming down.
L11296	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
L11295	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Aren't you going to change?
L11294	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
L11270	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
L11269	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
L11268	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
L11267	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
L11265	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
L11264	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
L11263	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	What are you saying?
L11262	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
L11261	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
L11259	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	No reason why...
L11258	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Why?
L11257	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	No, Sandro... Please...
L11256	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Nothing.
L11255	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Sandro ...What's the matter?
L11245	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Okay. In a few minutes.
L11244	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Then I'll see you later.
L11243	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	So, you wonder why?
L11242	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
L11240	u3545	m233	SANDRO	As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
L11239	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
L11237	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
L11236	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
L11235	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	But why am I so infatuated with you?
L11233	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
L11232	u3545	m233	SANDRO	That's why I asked you...
L11231	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
L11230	u3545	m233	SANDRO	You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
L11229	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
L11228	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
L11227	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	What! Get married?
L11226	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Claudia, let's get married?
L11225	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
L11224	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
L11223	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Why are you looking at me like that?
L11222	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
L11221	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	And why did you drop them?
L11220	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
L11214	u3545	m233	SANDRO	So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
L11213	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
L11212	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
L11210	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	"Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: ""Claudia, I love you,"" I would believe you..."
L11209	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Then why do you say them?
L11208	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
L11207	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Does it please you to say such things?
L11206	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
L11205	u3545	m233	SANDRO	What is it, Claudia?
L11203	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
L11202	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Are you joking?
L11201	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
L11200	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Who knows why they all left...
L11199	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
L11167	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
L11166	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Any news?
L11030	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But why, Claudia?... Why?
L11029	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
L11028	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
L11027	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Claudia, listen to me...
L11010	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
L11009	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And what about you?
L11008	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
L11007	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
L11006	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
L11005	u3545	m233	SANDRO	It takes even less.
L11004	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
L11003	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
L11002	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Oh, Sandro...
L11001	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
L11000	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
L10999	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
L10998	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
L10993	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But then when will we see each other?
L10992	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Yes, you should go.
L10991	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
L10990	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
L10989	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Then I'll go with you.
L10988	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Yes.
L10987	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
L10883	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Yes, maybe that is better.
L10882	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
L10856	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
L10855	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
L10854	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Occasionally, but always with affection.
L10853	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Has she ever spoken to you about me?
L10852	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Yes, very much so.
L10851	u3545	m233	SANDRO	You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
L10850	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
L10849	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Are you feeling better?
L10845	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
L10844	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
L10841	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
L10840	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Nothing... nothing at all!
L10831	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	And how do you explain that?
L10830	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
L10826	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
L10825	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And why do you tell us this only now?
L10824	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
L10794	u3545	m233	SANDRO	No.
L10793	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Find anything?
L10754	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
L10753	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
L10752	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And why haven't they left each other?
L10751	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
L10641	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
L10640	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Shall we go for a swim?
L10632	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
L10631	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	There's nothing much to laugh at.
L10626	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
L10625	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	How should I be ... arrogant?
L10624	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Don't be so humble.
L10623	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	That seems to apply to you also...
L10622	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
L11333	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
L11332	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
L11331	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
L11330	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
L11329	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
L11328	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
L11327	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
L11326	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Patrizia, I'm afraid.
L11320	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
L11319	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
L11318	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
L11290	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	It means being without money.
L11289	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	What do you mean by sensible?
L11288	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
L11285	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
L11284	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
L11275	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
L11274	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
L11142	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	But then why did you bother changing?
L11141	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm not coming.
L11110	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	No.
L11109	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Do you consider that a compliment?
L11108	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	You say that just to flatter me.
L11107	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	It's divine!
L11040	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	It was futile. We went all over.
L11039	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	But where did you finally end up?
L10958	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
L10957	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
L10956	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	To do what?
L10955	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
L10885	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
L10884	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
L10732	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
L10731	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Have you ever been in love?
L10730	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
L10729	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
L10725	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
L10724	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I would say he's pretty depraved.
L10723	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
L10709	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	Better dead.
L10708	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
L11138	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
L11137	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
L11136	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	It couldn't be any clearer.
L11135	u3536	m233	GIULIA	And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
L11119	u3536	m233	GIULIA	But why all nudes?
L11118	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
L11114	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
L11113	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	But for what reason should I come there?
L11112	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Please, you come too...
L10736	u3532	m233	CLAUDIA	To the shark.
L10735	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Who are you talking to?
L11043	u3533	m233	CORRADO	When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
L11042	u3536	m233	GIULIA	But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
L10890	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
L10889	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
L10865	u3536	m233	GIULIA	We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome...
L10864	u3533	m233	CORRADO	What do you think?
L10863	u3536	m233	GIULIA	How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
L10820	u3533	m233	CORRADO	If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
L10819	u3536	m233	GIULIA	But why?... What if it starts to rain?
L10818	u3533	m233	CORRADO	I'll stay here also.
L10780	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
L10779	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Looks like the weather is changing.
L10750	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
L10749	u3536	m233	GIULIA	He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
L10748	u3533	m233	CORRADO	But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
L10747	u3533	m233	CORRADO	"Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say ""how beautiful"" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything."
L10746	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
L10689	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Who's moving?
L10688	u3536	m233	GIULIA	There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
L10687	u3533	m233	CORRADO	What happened?
L10643	u3533	m233	CORRADO	You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
L10642	u3536	m233	GIULIA	At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
L10635	u3533	m233	CORRADO	I detest comparisons made with oil.
L10634	u3536	m233	GIULIA	It's as smooth and slick as oil.
L10822	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
L10821	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
L10815	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
L10814	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
L10797	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
L10796	u3533	m233	CORRADO	It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
L10676	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
L10675	u3545	m233	SANDRO	There too...
L10674	u3533	m233	CORRADO	I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
L10941	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	I think it's possible.
L10940	u3533	m233	CORRADO	Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
L10939	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
L10938	u3533	m233	CORRADO	I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
L10937	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
L10936	u3533	m233	CORRADO	So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
L10935	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
L10924	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	We'll try again.
L10923	u3533	m233	CORRADO	And what are we going to do now?
L11325	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Yes, yes, of course.
L11324	u3534	m233	ETTORE	And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
L11323	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
L11322	u3534	m233	ETTORE	What is it?
L11321	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Ettore...
L11055	u3534	m233	ETTORE	It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
L11054	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	First let the poor thing have something to eat.
L11045	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
L11044	u3534	m233	ETTORE	And who is this?
L10758	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
L10757	u3536	m233	GIULIA	You men are all so dreadful!
L10756	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
L10755	u3536	m233	GIULIA	The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
L10670	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Ask her.
L10669	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Where is she going?
L10653	u3536	m233	GIULIA	What has everybody got against me this morning?
L10652	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
L11133	u3536	m233	GIULIA	I appeal to you more?
L11132	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
L11131	u3536	m233	GIULIA	But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
L11130	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
L11129	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Don't you ever paint men?
L11127	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
L11126	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	Why don't you try?
L11125	u3536	m233	GIULIA	But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
L11124	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
L11123	u3536	m233	GIULIA	I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
L11122	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	Oh, there are as many as one wants.
L11121	u3536	m233	GIULIA	And where do you find the models?
L11120	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
L11116	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Here I am.
L11115	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	Giulia...
L11061	u3537	m233	GOFFREDO	Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
L11060	u3536	m233	GIULIA	Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
L10970	u3547	m233	YOUNG SAILOR	I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
L10969	u3538	m233	LIEUTENANT	Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
L10968	u3547	m233	YOUNG SAILOR	What other boat?
L10967	u3538	m233	LIEUTENANT	Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
L10966	u3547	m233	YOUNG SAILOR	Yes, sir. Three times.
L10965	u3538	m233	LIEUTENANT	So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
L10964	u3547	m233	YOUNG SAILOR	Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
L10963	u3538	m233	LIEUTENANT	They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
L11026	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
L11025	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
L11024	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	But for you, what comes first: music or love?
L11023	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
L11022	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	Because this is a Chinese radio.
L11021	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	And why wouldn't we have one like this?
L11020	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	No, not like this one.
L11019	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	We have a radio like this, too.
L11018	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
L11017	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	And what did they say about me?
L11016	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
L11015	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
L11014	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	Yes, she takes care of the garden.
L11013	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
L11012	u3539	m233	MAN'S VOICE	I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
L11011	u3546	m233	WOMAN'S VOICE	I work there but I'm really a stranger.
L10875	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	I know, I know. One thing at a time.
L10874	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
L10873	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	Don't worry, we've got everything.
L10872	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
L10871	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
L10870	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Unfortunately, no.
L10869	u3540	m233	MARSHAL	Anything new develop?
L11195	u3541	m233	MIDWIFE	Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
L11194	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Thank you.
L11193	u3541	m233	MIDWIFE	There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
L11192	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
L11187	u3541	m233	MIDWIFE	Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
L11186	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And do you remember where she got off?
L11185	u3541	m233	MIDWIFE	I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
L10862	u3542	m233	OLD MAN	Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
L10861	u3545	m233	SANDRO	And how come you're up so early?
L10860	u3542	m233	OLD MAN	At this time of the year there are so many boats...
L10859	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
L10858	u3542	m233	OLD MAN	What boat?
L10857	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Whose boat is that?
L10835	u3542	m233	OLD MAN	From Panarea. Why?
L10834	u3545	m233	SANDRO	But where did you come from?
L10833	u3542	m233	OLD MAN	No. The owners are in Australia.
L10832	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Are you the owner of this place?
L11287	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
L11286	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Your mother?
L11283	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
L11282	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
L11281	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
L11280	u3545	m233	SANDRO	They didn't seem too good.
L11279	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Did you manage to find good rooms?
L11278	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Yes, we will.
L11277	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
L10954	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Good. Then I'll meet you there.
L10953	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
L10952	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I'll go and get my valise.
L10951	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
L10950	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Patrizia, what are you going to do?
L10881	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	I don't see why I should mind.
L10880	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
L10807	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	But you have to  consider all possibilities, Sandro.
L10806	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
L10805	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
L10960	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
L10959	u3544	m233	RAIMONDO	Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
L10785	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
L10784	u3544	m233	RAIMONDO	You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
L10728	u3544	m233	RAIMONDO	I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
L10727	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	You know, I don't love anybody.
L10726	u3544	m233	RAIMONDO	Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
L10722	u3544	m233	RAIMONDO	If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
L10721	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
L10660	u3544	m233	RAIMONDO	I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
L10659	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
L10656	u3544	m233	RAIMONDO	Lady Patrizia!
L10655	u3543	m233	PATRIZIA	Why have we stopped?
L11105	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
L11104	u3548	m233	ZURIA	Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
L11103	u3545	m233	SANDRO	You really must do me this one favor.
L11102	u3548	m233	ZURIA	Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
L11101	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
L11100	u3548	m233	ZURIA	About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
L11099	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Is that far from here?
L11098	u3548	m233	ZURIA	Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
L11097	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Is that possible?
L11096	u3548	m233	ZURIA	As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
L11095	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
L11094	u3548	m233	ZURIA	Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
L11093	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc?.
L11092	u3548	m233	ZURIA	No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
L11091	u3545	m233	SANDRO	You're kidding!
L11090	u3548	m233	ZURIA	She costs a hundred thousand lire.
L11075	u3548	m233	ZURIA	Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
L11074	u3545	m233	SANDRO	I would like to ask you something.
L11073	u3548	m233	ZURIA	Yes. Until proven otherwise.
L11072	u3545	m233	SANDRO	Zuria?
L14291	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
L14290	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't know... I don't know...
L14289	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	For what?
L14288	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
L14287	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Should you see a doctor?
L14286	u3549	m234	AGNES	It's not my time of month.
L14285	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	What do you mean?
L14284	u3549	m234	AGNES	It's not that... it's not that...
L14283	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
L14281	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Say it!
L14280	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes, Mother.
L14279	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
L14278	u3549	m234	AGNES	They were stained.
L14277	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why?
L14276	u3549	m234	AGNES	I burnt them.
L14275	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
L14274	u3549	m234	AGNES	No.
L14273	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
L14272	u3549	m234	AGNES	It made them holy.
L14271	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
L14270	u3549	m234	AGNES	In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
L14269	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why?
L14268	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes Mother.
L14267	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
L14117	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Dear Jesus...
L14116	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't know.
L14115	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why?
L14114	u3549	m234	AGNES	I'm being punished.
L14113	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes, of God.
L14112	u3549	m234	AGNES	Of God.
L14111	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
L14110	u3549	m234	AGNES	No I don't... the host is enough.
L14109	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	You've got to eat something Agnes.
L14108	u3549	m234	AGNES	I'm not hungry.
L14107	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
L14106	u3549	m234	AGNES	But she watches... she listens.
L14105	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
L14104	u3549	m234	AGNES	Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
L14103	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who?
L14102	u3549	m234	AGNES	God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
L14101	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh my dear child.
L14100	u3549	m234	AGNES	No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
L14099	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
L14098	u3549	m234	AGNES	I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
L14097	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	That's not what he meant.
L14096	u3549	m234	AGNES	Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
L14095	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who tells you these things?
L14094	u3549	m234	AGNES	That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
L14093	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Agnes...
L14092	u3549	m234	AGNES	Look at the statues, they're thin.
L14091	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why?
L14090	u3549	m234	AGNES	It's a sin to be fat.
L14089	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who told you this?
L14088	u3549	m234	AGNES	No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
L14087	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	He loves you the way you are.
L14086	u3549	m234	AGNES	I do, I have to be attractive to God.
L14085	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
L14084	u3549	m234	AGNES	Because...
L14083	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
L14082	u3549	m234	AGNES	I'm a blimp.
L14081	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Agnes...
L14080	u3549	m234	AGNES	I am, there's too much flesh on me.
L14079	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh, for Heaven's sake.
L14078	u3549	m234	AGNES	Because I'm getting fat.
L14077	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who?
L14076	u3549	m234	AGNES	No.
L14075	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	One of the other Sisters?
L14074	u3549	m234	AGNES	She'd punish me.
L14073	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why?
L14072	u3549	m234	AGNES	I can't say.
L14071	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who?
L14070	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14069	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Through someone else?
L14068	u3549	m234	AGNES	No.
L14067	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	He talked to you Himself?
L14066	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
L14755	u3549	m234	AGNES	I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
L14754	u3555	m234	MARTHA	H... how?
L14753	u3549	m234	AGNES	I put her to sleep.
L14752	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What did you do?
L14751	u3549	m234	AGNES	She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
L14750	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
L14749	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14748	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You saw it all didn't you?
L14747	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14746	u3555	m234	MARTHA	She took the baby in her arms?
L14745	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14744	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
L14740	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't remember.
L14739	u3555	m234	MARTHA	It was alive wasn't it?
L14738	u3549	m234	AGNES	It was dead.
L14733	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
L14732	u3549	m234	AGNES	God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
L14731	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, who did this to you?

L14510	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why?

L14491	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14490	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
L14372	u3555	m234	MARTHA	As much as God loves you.

L14367	u3549	m234	AGNES	I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
L14366	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You're a mistake.
L14365	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes I am.
L14364	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Are you intelligent?
L14363	u3549	m234	AGNES	No I'm not.
L14362	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, you're stupid.

L14359	u3549	m234	AGNES	No I'm not.
L14358	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
L14357	u3549	m234	AGNES	Alright.
L14356	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
L14355	u3549	m234	AGNES	I'm afraid.
L14354	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
L14353	u3549	m234	AGNES	She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
L14352	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What?
L14351	u3549	m234	AGNES	And then...
L14350	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Oh, yes.
L14349	u3549	m234	AGNES	Her headaches.
L14348	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How does she know that?
L14347	u3549	m234	AGNES	Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
L14346	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why?
L14345	u3549	m234	AGNES	She says my whole body's a mistake.
L14344	u3555	m234	MARTHA	That you're a mistake?
L14343	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14342	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And that you're stupid?
L14341	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14340	u3555	m234	MARTHA	She tells you you're ugly?
L14339	u3549	m234	AGNES	... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
L14338	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Yes?
L14337	u3549	m234	AGNES	... makes me...
L14336	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Yes?
L14335	u3549	m234	AGNES	She...
L14334	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
L14333	u3549	m234	AGNES	She watches... she listens.
L14332	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How?
L14331	u3549	m234	AGNES	She can.
L14330	u3555	m234	MARTHA	She can't hurt you any more.
L14329	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14328	u3555	m234	MARTHA	She's dead isn't she?
L14327	u3549	m234	AGNES	I can't.
L14326	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You can tell me.
L14325	u3549	m234	AGNES	No...
L14324	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
L14323	u3549	m234	AGNES	I breathed!
L14322	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What did you do?
L14321	u3549	m234	AGNES	I'm always bad.
L14320	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What did you do?
L14319	u3549	m234	AGNES	Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
L14318	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Sometimes, yes.
L14317	u3549	m234	AGNES	Answer me!  You never answer me.
L14316	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes...
L14315	u3549	m234	AGNES	Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
L14314	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And you're unhappy.
L14313	u3549	m234	AGNES	That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
L14312	u3555	m234	MARTHA	But you're troubled... aren't you?
L14311	u3549	m234	AGNES	I'm not sick.
L14310	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
L14220	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes...
L14219	u3549	m234	AGNES	Everything... I don't have children.
L14218	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What the child?
L14217	u3549	m234	AGNES	I was a mistake.
L14216	u3555	m234	MARTHA	... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
L14215	u3549	m234	AGNES	Not my fault.
L14214	u3555	m234	MARTHA	... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
L14213	u3549	m234	AGNES	I can't help it if I'm stupid.
L14212	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
L14211	u3549	m234	AGNES	If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
L14210	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Is that what she said?
L14209	u3549	m234	AGNES	A mistake... it was a mistake...
L14208	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, how did your mother get you?
L14207	u3549	m234	AGNES	A mistake...
L14206	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
L14205	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Like you?
L14204	u3549	m234	AGNES	From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
L14203	u3555	m234	MARTHA	If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
L14202	u3549	m234	AGNES	Because I don't want one.
L14201	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why not?
L14200	u3549	m234	AGNES	Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
L14199	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why not?
L14198	u3549	m234	AGNES	I could never be a mother.
L14197	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
L14196	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L14195	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, did you love your mother?
L14194	u3549	m234	AGNES	She'd get angry.
L14193	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why not?  Mmm?
L14192	u3549	m234	AGNES	No, but I can never tell her that.
L14191	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you believe she really saw them?
L14190	u3549	m234	AGNES	No.
L14189	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you?
L14188	u3549	m234	AGNES	No.
L14187	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Did your mother see angels often?
L14186	u3549	m234	AGNES	An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
L14185	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
L14184	u3549	m234	AGNES	You'll laugh.
L14183	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes...
L14182	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't know.
L14181	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who?
L14180	u3549	m234	AGNES	Somebody told her.
L14179	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How did she know that?
L14178	u3549	m234	AGNES	She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
L14177	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What things?
L14176	u3549	m234	AGNES	I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
L14175	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You have trouble sleeping?
L14174	u3549	m234	AGNES	No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
L14173	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
L14172	u3549	m234	AGNES	Where did you go?
L14171	u3555	m234	MARTHA	It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
L14170	u3549	m234	AGNES	Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
L14169	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
L14165	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
L14164	u3549	m234	AGNES	I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
L14163	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
L14162	u3549	m234	AGNES	Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
L14161	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Like what?
L14160	u3549	m234	AGNES	Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
L14159	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
L14158	u3549	m234	AGNES	No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
L14157	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
L14155	u3549	m234	AGNES	She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
L14154	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What else did she tell you?
L14153	u3549	m234	AGNES	She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
L14152	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You liked Sister Paul?
L13997	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't know.
L13996	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why should I?
L13995	u3549	m234	AGNES	No... do you?
L13994	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you know a Marie?
L13993	u3549	m234	AGNES	Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
L13992	u3555	m234	MARTHA	From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
L13991	u3549	m234	AGNES	Where do you think babies come from?
L13990	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What?
L13989	u3549	m234	AGNES	One.
L13988	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
L13987	u3549	m234	AGNES	No questions.
L13986	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Does it bother you?
L13985	u3549	m234	AGNES	Why do you smoke?
L13984	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I've stopped menstruating
L13983	u3549	m234	AGNES	Why not?
L13982	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I can't have them any more.
L13981	u3549	m234	AGNES	Would you like some?
L13980	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No.
L13979	u3549	m234	AGNES	Do you have any children?
L13978	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Not at the moment, no.
L13977	u3549	m234	AGNES	Would you like to be?
L13976	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No.
L13975	u3549	m234	AGNES	Are you married?
L13974	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Martha Louise Livingston.
L13973	u3549	m234	AGNES	What's your real name?
L13972	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Anything.
L13971	u3549	m234	AGNES	Anything?
L13970	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
L13969	u3549	m234	AGNES	What do you mean?
L13968	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Would you like to ask them?
L13967	u3549	m234	AGNES	No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
L13966	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes...
L13965	u3549	m234	AGNES	No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
L13964	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Then let's talk about something else...
L13963	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
L13962	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Yes I do,  but I want you to...
L13961	u3549	m234	AGNES	Don't you know?
L13960	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, how are babies born?
L13959	u3549	m234	AGNES	I... I don't understand.
L13958	u3555	m234	MARTHA	After God... before the waste-paper basket.
L13957	u3549	m234	AGNES	From God.
L13956	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Where'd it come from before that?
L13955	u3549	m234	AGNES	No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
L13954	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Is that where they say it came from... ?
L13953	u3549	m234	AGNES	From their heads...
L13952	u3555	m234	MARTHA	The baby they made up.
L13951	u3549	m234	AGNES	What baby?
L13950	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Where did the baby come from?
L13949	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L13948	u3555	m234	MARTHA	In the middle of all the pain?
L13947	u3549	m234	AGNES	I fell asleep.
L13946	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And then what?
L13945	u3549	m234	AGNES	I got sicker.
L13944	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And what happened?
L13943	u3549	m234	AGNES	I went to my room.
L13942	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And what did you do?
L13941	u3549	m234	AGNES	Down... there.
L13940	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Where?
L13939	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L13938	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Did it hurt?
L13937	u3549	m234	AGNES	Something I ate.
L13936	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How were you sick?
L13935	u3549	m234	AGNES	No. I was sick.
L13934	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you remember the night they said it came?
L13933	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't know.
L13932	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why should they?
L13931	u3549	m234	AGNES	I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
L13930	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Would you like to talk about it?
L13929	u3549	m234	AGNES	You want to talk about the baby don't you?
L13927	u3549	m234	AGNES	In the confessional.
L13926	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Where do you meet?
L13925	u3549	m234	AGNES	Oh, yes.
L13924	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And you like that?
L13923	u3549	m234	AGNES	At least once a week.
L13922	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Often?
L13921	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L13920	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You've been alone together?
L13919	u3549	m234	AGNES	No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
L13918	u3555	m234	MARTHA	He's told you?
L13917	u3549	m234	AGNES	Oh, I know he does.
L13916	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you think he loves you?
L13915	u3549	m234	AGNES	Oh, yes!
L13914	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
L13913	u3549	m234	AGNES	Oh, there are so many.
L13912	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who?
L13911	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L13910	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
L13909	u3549	m234	AGNES	I love you.
L13908	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Uh huh.
L13907	u3549	m234	AGNES	Right now?
L13906	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Well, who in particular?
L13905	u3549	m234	AGNES	Everyone.
L13904	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who?
L13903	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L13902	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Have you ever loved anyone?
L13901	u3549	m234	AGNES	Love.
L13900	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Second thing that comes to your mind.
L13899	u3549	m234	AGNES	God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
L13898	u3555	m234	MARTHA	First thing that comes to your mind?
L13897	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L13896	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Anything... may I sit down?
L13895	u3549	m234	AGNES	I don't know.
L13894	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What would you like to talk about.
L13893	u3549	m234	AGNES	Let's talk about something else.
L13892	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
L13891	u3549	m234	AGNES	No I'm not.
L13890	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Was it Sister Marguerite?
L13889	u3549	m234	AGNES	That wasn't me.
L13888	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I just heard you.
L13887	u3549	m234	AGNES	No I don't.
L13886	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You have a lovely voice.
L13885	u3549	m234	AGNES	Yes.
L13884	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
L14378	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Sister...
L14377	u3550	m234	ELDERLY NUN	Look into the convent records.
L14376	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What?
L14375	u3550	m234	ELDERLY NUN	???
L14374	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
L14373	u3550	m234	ELDERLY NUN	I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
L14147	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
L14146	u3551	m234	EVE	The bishop is breathing down our necks.
L14145	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why?
L14144	u3551	m234	EVE	The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
L14143	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
L14142	u3551	m234	EVE	Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
L13828	u3551	m234	EVE	Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
L13827	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Eve, she strangled a baby!
L13826	u3551	m234	EVE	Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
L13825	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
L14417	u3552	m234	LARRY	If I find anything I'll call you.
L14416	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Thanks. 
L14415	u3552	m234	LARRY	You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
L14414	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
L14413	u3552	m234	LARRY	What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
L14412	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Larry...
L14411	u3552	m234	LARRY	You got to be crazy.
L14410	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I don't know.
L14409	u3552	m234	LARRY	What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
L14408	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Something they... that they overlooked.
L14407	u3552	m234	LARRY	I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
L14406	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Larry there's got to be something missing.
L14405	u3552	m234	LARRY	Marty, what are you doing here?
L14404	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Larry...
L14132	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Thanks...
L14131	u3552	m234	LARRY	Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
L14651	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
L14650	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	No!
L14649	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I can get you new evidence next week.
L14648	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	No, no, no...
L14647	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Next week.
L14646	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	When?
L14645	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I'll have it.
L14644	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	You have proof?
L14643	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
L14642	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	It's gone on long enough. You're out.
L14641	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I'll have a decision by next week.
L14640	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
L14639	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
L14638	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
L14637	u3555	m234	MARTHA	All I want is one more week.
L14149	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
L14148	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	???
L14139	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
L14138	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
L13822	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What about Roger? He's free.
L13821	u3553	m234	LEVEAU	Martha, it's you.
L14044	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I... I'm Martha, Mama.
L14043	u3554	m234	MAMA	Who are you?
L14042	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
L14041	u3554	m234	MAMA	I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
L14040	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Marie's dead Mama.
L14039	u3554	m234	MAMA	You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
L14038	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
L14037	u3554	m234	MAMA	Not any more... now I like chocolate.
L14036	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
L14035	u3554	m234	MAMA	Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
L14034	u3555	m234	MARTHA	It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
L14033	u3554	m234	MAMA	Who are you?
L14032	u3555	m234	MARTHA	It's your favourite...
L14031	u3554	m234	MAMA	Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
L14030	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
L14054	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Uh huh.
L14053	u3558	m234	SISTER ANNE	Yes.
L14052	u3555	m234	MARTHA	The one up on the third floor?
L14051	u3558	m234	SISTER ANNE	Oh that one there, in the corner.
L14050	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
L14049	u3558	m234	SISTER ANNE	No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
L14048	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
L14047	u3558	m234	SISTER ANNE	Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
L14046	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How do you survive?
L14045	u3558	m234	SISTER ANNE	The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
L14309	u3556	m234	MONSIGNOR	Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
L14308	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
L14307	u3556	m234	MONSIGNOR	But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
L14306	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
L14305	u3556	m234	MONSIGNOR	Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
L14304	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What business is it of yours..?
L14303	u3556	m234	MONSIGNOR	Do you still go to church?
L14302	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who told you this?
L14301	u3556	m234	MONSIGNOR	And you had a sister who died in the convent.
L14300	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What does this have to do with..?
L14299	u3556	m234	MONSIGNOR	Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
L14298	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
L14297	u3556	m234	MONSIGNOR	Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
L14296	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No.
L14742	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Wasn't it!
L14741	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh, don't do this!
L14737	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What happened to the baby?
L14736	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She can't remember.
L14735	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Agnes, what happened to the baby?
L14734	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	That's enough.
L14685	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Then she's a liar.
L14684	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I doubt that's what she'd say.
L14683	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I left it with her and I went for help.
L14682	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Before or after you killed the child?
L14681	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
L14680	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You tied the cord around its neck.
L14679	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	No!
L14678	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And the baby.
L14677	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
L14676	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
L14675	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	That's a lie.
L14674	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You wanted that child out of the way.
L14673	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She didn't want any help.
L14672	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You went to the room to help with the birth.
L14671	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	The scandal...
L14670	u3555	m234	MARTHA	The baby?
L14669	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I don't know... too late to stop it.
L14668	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Too late for what?
L14667	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh, don't be ridiculous.
L14666	u3555	m234	MARTHA	For what?  An abortion?
L14665	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I didn't guess until it was too late.
L14664	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And you didn't send her to a doctor.
L14663	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes.
L14662	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Did you know she was pregnant?
L14661	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Is it because she's a nun?
L14660	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Was it you?
L14659	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why do you insist upon pressing...
L14658	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who knew she was pregnant?
L14657	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	My God, but you're determined.
L14656	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I have a few more questions to ask her.
L14655	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Hasn't she had enough?
L14654	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Where is she?
L14653	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	This is permission to take her apart.
L14636	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
L14635	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
L14634	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I'm concerned about her health.
L14633	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
L14632	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why would I lie?
L14631	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
L14630	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
L14629	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Somebody told her.
L14628	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
L14627	u3555	m234	MARTHA	There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
L14626	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
L14625	u3555	m234	MARTHA	That's what I have to believe...
L14624	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
L14623	u3555	m234	MARTHA	But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
L14622	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She is an innocent.
L14621	u3555	m234	MARTHA	But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
L14620	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
L14619	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
L14618	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
L14617	u3555	m234	MARTHA	But how did it happen?
L14616	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You're saying God did it?
L14615	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
L14614	u3555	m234	MARTHA	This is insane.
L14613	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
L14612	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Well give me a reasonable explanation
L14611	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Don't be ridiculous.
L14610	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How  ?
L14609	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
L14608	u3555	m234	MARTHA	My God, you're as crazy as...
L14607	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Why must he be anybody?
L14606	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who is he?
L14605	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	The father!
L14604	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
L14603	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She's been touched by God, yes.
L14602	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You think she's a saint?
L14601	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	For Agnes.
L14600	u3555	m234	MARTHA	For the Church?
L14599	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
L14598	u3555	m234	MARTHA	One that will ask the questions you want asked.
L14597	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
L14596	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You're what?
L14595	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
L14573	u3555	m234	MARTHA	NO... no... I said leave her alone.
L14572	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
L14489	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Then let's begin.
L14488	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Of course.
L14487	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	May I be present?
L14486	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No.
L14485	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Would it stop you if I did?
L14484	u3555	m234	MARTHA	The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
L14483	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Begin what?
L14482	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I'd like to begin.
L14481	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Listen to her singing.
L14480	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
L14479	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
L14478	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
L14477	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Become?  One is born a saint.
L14476	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you want to become one?
L14475	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes I do.
L14474	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you think they ever existed?
L14473	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
L14472	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
L14471	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	And Saint John would chew tobacco.
L14470	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Oh, you've come a long way baby.
L14469	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Mary Magdelen?
L14468	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Right...
L14467	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Pipe!
L14466	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Saint Peter?
L14465	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Even Christ would partake socially.
L14464	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Hand rolled.
L14463	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
L14462	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Long, thin and filtered.
L14461	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
L14460	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
L14459	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Fine thanks...
L14458	u3555	m234	MARTHA	All right?
L14457	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
L14456	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I'd love one.
L14455	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Would you like one?  Huh?
L14454	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	No, it reminds me.
L14453	u3555	m234	MARTHA	My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
L14451	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
L14450	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	So you left the Church because you had freckles?
L14449	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
L14448	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	And what has that to do with it?
L14447	u3555	m234	MARTHA	That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
L14446	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Stupid woman... and that's all?
L14445	u3555	m234	MARTHA	It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
L14444	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
L14443	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Nothing...
L14442	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
L14441	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You just said...
L14440	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
L14439	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
L14438	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Bullshit yourself!
L14437	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Bullshit!
L14436	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Because I am a moral person.
L14435	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
L14434	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
L14433	u3555	m234	MARTHA	An unhappy woman...
L14431	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I know you don't.
L14430	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
L14429	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Her spiritual health.
L14428	u3555	m234	MARTHA	The woman's health is at stake.
L14427	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I haven't decided yet.
L14426	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Don't deny it!
L14425	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	We'll see about that.
L14424	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I'd like yours too.
L14423	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	And my permission?
L14403	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Oh, God.
L14402	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Because I didn't know... 
L14401	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
L14400	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I knew that after the fact.
L14399	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
L14398	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh God, if only I'd known.
L14397	u3555	m234	MARTHA	There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
L14396	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh, dear God.
L14395	u3555	m234	MARTHA	She molested her!
L14394	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I don't think I care to know.
L14393	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you know what she did to her?
L14392	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She drank too much. That's what killed her.
L14391	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Listening to angels?
L14390	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes.
L14389	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Like keeping her home from school?
L14387	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And Agnes' father?
L14386	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
L14385	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
L14384	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
L14383	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Your niece!
L14382	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	About what?
L14381	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You lied to me
L14295	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
L14294	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Sister Paul?
L14293	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
L14292	u3555	m234	MARTHA	When was that?
L14265	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
L14264	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What sheets?
L14263	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	The sheets...
L14262	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What is it?
L14261	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh, Dear God...
L14260	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Was the child full term?
L14259	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	There's nothing here.
L14258	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Take at look at it.
L14257	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes.
L14256	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
L14255	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Nothing.
L14254	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Visitors to the convent.
L14253	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Earthquakes?
L14252	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
L14251	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh, some time in January.
L14250	u3555	m234	MARTHA	When would Agnes have conceived the child?
L14249	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Answers.
L14248	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	All right, what do you need.
L14247	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
L14246	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	How?
L14245	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Aquittal.
L14244	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	What?
L14243	u3555	m234	MARTHA	There's another choice.
L14242	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
L14241	u3555	m234	MARTHA	No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
L14240	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I am...
L14239	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Then help her.
L14238	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
L14237	u3555	m234	MARTHA	???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
L14236	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	???  
L14235	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
L14234	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She is not a child.
L14233	u3555	m234	MARTHA	... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
L14232	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I'm only interested...
L14231	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
L14230	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	It's my affair too.
L14229	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
L14228	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
L14227	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
L14226	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	The Catholic Church...
L14225	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I hate ignorance and stupidity.
L14224	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Nuns... you hate nuns.
L14223	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What?
L14222	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	You hate us don't you?
L14129	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
L14128	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
L14127	u3555	m234	MARTHA	It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
L14126	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
L14125	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Not simple, no.
L14124	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
L14123	u3555	m234	MARTHA	She has it now.
L14122	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
L14121	u3555	m234	MARTHA	She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
L14120	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
L14119	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
L14065	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	About two years before.
L14064	u3555	m234	MARTHA	This was before her pregnancy?
L14063	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She stopped eating completely...
L14062	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And what happened?
L14061	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I was appalled, just as you are now.
L14060	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And you weren't shocked?
L14059	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Shortly after she came to us.
L14058	u3555	m234	MARTHA	When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
L14057	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
L14056	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
L14055	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
L14020	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
L14019	u3555	m234	MARTHA	That possibility never occurred to you?
L14018	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	That's absurd!
L14017	u3555	m234	MARTHA	One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
L14016	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Who?
L14015	u3555	m234	MARTHA	It's possible isn't it?
L14014	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
L14013	u3555	m234	MARTHA	That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
L14012	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I've already told you what I thought.
L14011	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And in your eyes?
L14010	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	No... not in the eyes of the police.
L14009	u3555	m234	MARTHA	So, someone else could have done it.
L14008	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
L14007	u3555	m234	MARTHA	If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
L14006	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
L14005	u3555	m234	MARTHA	That's ridiculous...
L14004	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
L14003	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
L14002	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
L14001	u3555	m234	MARTHA	From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
L14000	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I believe Agnes is different.
L13999	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What's your opinion?
L13998	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
L13883	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
L13882	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I am not with the Inquisition.
L13881	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
L13880	u3555	m234	MARTHA	The science of psychiatry.
L13879	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
L13878	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
L13877	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
L13876	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why do you think that?
L13875	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
L13874	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Look, someone gave her the baby.
L13873	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
L13872	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Why haven't you asked her?
L13871	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
L13870	u3555	m234	MARTHA	And you didn't try to find out who?
L13869	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Obviously there was.
L13868	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Could there have been anyone else?
L13867	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
L13866	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What's his name?
L13865	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes, but I...
L13864	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Was there a priest?
L13863	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	None as far as I know.
L13862	u3555	m234	MARTHA	What man had access to her?
L13861	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I haven't a clue.
L13860	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who was the father?
L13859	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
L13858	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
L13857	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
L13856	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How did she hide it during the day?
L13855	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Yes.
L13854	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Is that normal?
L13853	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
L13852	u3555	m234	MARTHA	How did she hide it from the other nuns?
L13851	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	No-one.
L13850	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
L13849	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Unfiltered.
L13848	u3555	m234	MARTHA	I can beat that.
L13847	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	Two packs a day.
L13846	u3555	m234	MARTHA	You were a smoker?
L13845	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
L13844	u3555	m234	MARTHA	... Thank you.
L13843	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	You can call me Sister.
L13842	u3555	m234	MARTHA	Yes... I...
L13841	u3557	m234	MOTHER MIRIAM	I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
L65706	u3865	m256	BARTON	"I'll bet. Jesus ? ""The grand productive days."" What a goddamn phony."
L65705	u3864	m256	AUDREY	And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
L65704	u3865	m256	BARTON	Hah!
L65703	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
L65702	u3865	m256	BARTON	I want to know!
L65701	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Barton!
L65700	u3865	m256	BARTON	I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
L65699	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
L65698	u3865	m256	BARTON	What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
L65697	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
L65696	u3865	m256	BARTON	Before Bill came to Hollywood.
L65695	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Before what?
L65694	u3865	m256	BARTON	You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his ? what about before that?
L65693	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
L65692	u3865	m256	BARTON	You wrote his scripts for him?
L65691	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Well... THIS.
L65687	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
L65686	u3865	m256	BARTON	What are they like? What are they about?
L65685	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Yes, I'm afraid I have.
L65684	u3865	m256	BARTON	No, but the whole goddamn ? Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
L65683	u3864	m256	AUDREY	It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
L65682	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well I have to come up with ? an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
L65681	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
L65680	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
L65679	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
L65678	u3865	m256	BARTON	Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
L65677	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Hello, Barton.
L65672	u3864	m256	AUDREY	If I can. He gets jealous; he-
L65671	u3865	m256	BARTON	If you could, I'd ?
L65663	u3865	m256	BARTON	Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
L65662	u3864	m256	AUDREY	...Who is this?
L65661	u3865	m256	BARTON	Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this ? believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I ? I'm sorry - listen, how are you ? I'm sorry. You doing okay?
L65660	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Hello.
L65659	u3865	m256	BARTON	Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
L65559	u3865	m256	BARTON	What. What don't I understand?
L65558	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
L65557	u3865	m256	BARTON	Okay, but that doesn't excuse his ?
L65556	u3864	m256	AUDREY	He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
L65555	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
L65554	u3865	m256	BARTON	Really?...
L65553	u3864	m256	AUDREY	No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
L65552	u3865	m256	BARTON	What?! He's a son of a bitch!
L65551	u3864	m256	AUDREY	...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
L65546	u3865	m256	BARTON	That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
L65545	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Let him go.
L65465	u3865	m256	BARTON	No, no ?
L65464	u3864	m256	AUDREY	...I know this must look... funny.
L65463	u3865	m256	BARTON	I see.
L65461	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary ? Bill and I are... I love. We-
L65460	u3865	m256	BARTON	Please, Barton.
L65459	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
L65458	u3865	m256	BARTON	Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. ?I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
L65457	u3864	m256	AUDREY	I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
L65456	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yes I am. I'm working on a wres ? please call me Barton.
L65455	u3864	m256	AUDREY	I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
L65454	u3865	m256	BARTON	How about you? Will you be alright?
L65453	u3864	m256	AUDREY	I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
L65451	u3864	m256	AUDREY	He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
L65450	u3865	m256	BARTON	Is, uh... Is he okay?
L65676	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN ?
L65675	u3864	m256	AUDREY	I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks ? well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational?
L65670	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
L65669	u3864	m256	AUDREY	All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
L65666	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Drown all those rascals...
L65665	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
L65542	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Stop it, Bill!
L65541	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity ? the basest coin there is.
L65539	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
L65538	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
L65530	u3864	m256	AUDREY	Bill ?
L65529	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
L65525	u3864	m256	AUDREY	That doesn't help anything, Bill.
L65524	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	...This'll sometimes help.
L65519	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me ? lyin' and deceitful...
L65518	u3864	m256	AUDREY	That's hamburger grease, Bill.
L65517	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
L65882	u3865	m256	BARTON	Garland, it's me.
L65881	u3875	m256	VOICE	...Hello.
L65309	u3875	m256	VOICE	Chet! From downstairs!
L65308	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Who?
L65307	u3875	m256	VOICE	Chet!
L65306	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Who is this?
L65305	u3875	m256	VOICE	How d'ya like your room!
L65930	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
L65929	u3865	m256	BARTON	Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
L65871	u3865	m256	BARTON	He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
L65870	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	What else?
L65869	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well that's what he said.
L65866	u3865	m256	BARTON	Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
L65865	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
L65864	u3865	m256	BARTON	...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
L65852	u3865	m256	BARTON	I...
L65851	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Yeah, he's funny that way.
L65844	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
L65843	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Ever talk to him?
L65837	u3865	m256	BARTON	A week, eight, nine days ?
L65836	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	How long you been up there, Fink?
L65833	u3865	m256	BARTON	I ? I've got respect for ? for working guys, like you ?
L65832	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	What DID you mean?
L65831	u3865	m256	BARTON	No, I ? I didn't mean to sound ?
L65827	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
L65826	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Oh yeah? What kind of write?
L65825	u3865	m256	BARTON	I write.
L65674	u3865	m256	BARTON	I need help, Audrey.
L65673	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
L65668	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
L65667	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm sorry, I just feel like ?I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
L65548	u3865	m256	BARTON	Are you all right?
L65547	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
L65536	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
L65535	u3865	m256	BARTON	What's that?
L65534	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
L65533	u3865	m256	BARTON	I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
L65532	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	And what would that be, son?
L65531	u3865	m256	BARTON	Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent ? don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
L65523	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
L65522	u3865	m256	BARTON	...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man ? to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
L65521	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well... actually, no Bill...
L65520	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
L65439	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	So be it.
L65438	u3865	m256	BARTON	It's still a little early for me.
L65437	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
L65436	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
L65435	u3865	m256	BARTON	Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
L65430	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	Just Bill, please.
L65429	u3865	m256	BARTON	W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
L65428	u3874	m256	MAYHEW	I beg your pardon?
L65633	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well what do I tell him?
L65632	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
L65631	u3865	m256	BARTON	I can't write anything by tomorrow.
L65630	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going ? don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
L65629	u3865	m256	BARTON	I didn't say anything-
L65628	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
L65627	u3865	m256	BARTON	I don't understand-
L65626	u3870	m256	GEISLER	You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
L65625	u3865	m256	BARTON	But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
L65624	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
L65623	u3865	m256	BARTON	You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
L65622	u3870	m256	GEISLER	A souse!
L65621	u3865	m256	BARTON	He's a great writer ?
L65620	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
L65619	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
L65618	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
L65617	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
L65616	u3870	m256	GEISLER	What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
L65615	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well not much.
L65614	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
L65613	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started?
L65612	u3870	m256	GEISLER	On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
L65611	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well I...
L65610	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps ? this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
L65609	u3865	m256	BARTON	Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
L65608	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Wuddya got for me ? what the hell happened to your face?
L65423	u3865	m256	BARTON	Who?
L65422	u3870	m256	GEISLER	...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
L65421	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
L65420	u3865	m256	BARTON	Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected ?
L65419	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
L65418	u3865	m256	BARTON	But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
L65417	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
L65412	u3865	m256	BARTON	Then who should I talk to?
L65411	u3870	m256	GEISLER	What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
L65410	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
L65409	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
L65408	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm a writer. Ted O ?
L65407	u3870	m256	GEISLER	We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
L65406	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Huh? No, I'm ?
L65405	u3870	m256	GEISLER	Ever act?
L65404	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the ?
L65901	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Well, you just... sound a little?
L65900	u3865	m256	BARTON	Sound a little what?
L65899	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little ?
L65898	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yes... Isn't it?
L65897	u3869	m256	GARLAND	...Barton, is everything okay?
L65896	u3865	m256	BARTON	Have you read the Bible, Garland?
L65895	u3869	m256	GARLAND	...That's fine.
L65894	u3865	m256	BARTON	Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
L65893	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Well, I'm... glad to hear that ?
L65892	u3865	m256	BARTON	Not big in the sense of large ? although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
L65891	u3869	m256	GARLAND	What do you mean, Barton?
L65890	u3865	m256	BARTON	It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
L65889	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Go ahead, son.
L65888	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
L65887	u3869	m256	GARLAND	...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
L65885	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Okay.
L65884	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah, I'm fine, Garland ? I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
L65883	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
L65276	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash ? strike that, a lot of cash.
L65275	u3865	m256	BARTON	No, what did it say?
L65274	u3869	m256	GARLAND	...Look, they love you, kid ? everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
L65273	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism ? if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
L65272	u3865	m256	BARTON	...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
L65270	u3869	m256	GARLAND	I'd say you're already enjoying some.
L65269	u3865	m256	BARTON	I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
L65268	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
L65267	u3865	m256	BARTON	To see pap.
L65266	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night ? if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
L65265	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
L65264	u3869	m256	GARLAND	What do you do far a living?
L65263	u3865	m256	BARTON	To do what?
L65262	u3869	m256	GARLAND	We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
L65260	u3869	m256	GARLAND	Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
L65259	u3865	m256	BARTON	I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
L65959	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Because you DON'T LISTEN!
L65958	u3865	m256	BARTON	But Charlie ? why me? Why ?
L65952	u3865	m256	BARTON	I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
L65951	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me ? Charlie.
L65810	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
L65809	u3865	m256	BARTON	You'll be back?
L65805	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
L65804	u3865	m256	BARTON	It's more than I've got.
L65803	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime ? when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
L65802	u3865	m256	BARTON	Sure, Charlie.
L65798	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you ? well I do. Now don't argue with me.
L65797	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah, but Charlie ?
L65796	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on ? just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
L65795	u3865	m256	BARTON	...I just don't know what... to do?
L65794	u3865	m256	BARTON	Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy ? like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
L65793	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	It's okay... It's okay...
L65791	u3865	m256	BARTON	Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
L65790	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
L65789	u3865	m256	BARTON	Jesus, Charlie, I...
L65788	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
L65787	u3865	m256	BARTON	Jesus... You're leaving.
L65751	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
L65750	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
L65747	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
L65746	u3865	m256	BARTON	They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
L65745	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Jesus... They can tell that...
L65743	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	I believe you ? I KNOW you. But why should the police?
L65742	u3865	m256	BARTON	But I didn't do it ? don't you believe me?
L65741	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
L65740	u3865	m256	BARTON	I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to ?
L65739	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	What do you think happened?
L65738	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah.
L65737	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
L65736	u3865	m256	BARTON	We gotta call the police ?
L65735	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
L65734	u3865	m256	BARTON	I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
L65733	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
L65732	u3865	m256	BARTON	I didn't do this, I did NOT do this?
L65731	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hold on ?
L65730	u3865	m256	BARTON	You gotta believe me ?
L65729	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hold on ?
L65728	u3865	m256	BARTON	I've gotta call the police ? or you could call for me ?
L65727	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
L65723	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
L65722	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Will you stay with me till they get here?
L65721	u3865	m256	BARTON	Charlie, I'm in trouble ? something horrible's happened ? I've gotta call the police...
L65720	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
L65719	u3865	m256	BARTON	Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
L65718	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Why don't we go to your room-
L65717	u3865	m256	BARTON	No... Can I come in?
L65716	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Barton. Are you all right?
L65715	u3865	m256	BARTON	No... no...
L65714	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Are you sure ?
L65713	u3865	m256	BARTON	No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
L65712	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Can I come in?
L65605	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
L65604	u3865	m256	BARTON	Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
L65603	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	So they say.
L65602	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, I guess you pick your poison.
L65601	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
L65600	u3865	m256	BARTON	What do you mean?
L65599	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
L65598	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well...
L65597	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
L65596	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	What a dump...
L65595	u3865	m256	BARTON	I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
L65594	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Your room does that too?
L65590	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me ? I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
L65589	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
L65588	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact ? New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
L65587	u3865	m256	BARTON	You're leaving?
L65586	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
L65585	u3865	m256	BARTON	And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
L65583	u3865	m256	BARTON	Where there's life there's hope.
L65582	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
L65581	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
L65580	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah, but ?
L65579	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
L65578	u3865	m256	BARTON	How did you know about that?
L65577	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
L65576	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started ? I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me ? my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
L65575	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
L65572	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
L65571	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
L65570	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
L65568	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	A little lift, yeah...
L65567	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
L65566	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
L65565	u3865	m256	BARTON	Seems like nothing but, lately.
L65564	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
L65563	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
L65562	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Because that would mean they gave you mine.
L65561	u3865	m256	BARTON	Hi, Charlie.
L65560	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	I hope these are your shoes.
L65509	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
L65508	u3865	m256	BARTON	It's okay, it's okay.
L65506	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Ready... wrestle!
L65505	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Yeah, okay.
L65504	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	"...All right now, when I say ""Ready... wrestle!""  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?"
L65501	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
L65500	u3865	m256	BARTON	That's all right, really ?
L65499	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration ?
L65498	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
L65497	u3865	m256	BARTON	Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself ?
L65496	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor ? though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong ? Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
L65495	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
L65494	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah...
L65493	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Not at all. It's damned interesting.
L65492	u3865	m256	BARTON	...This must be boring you.
L65490	u3865	m256	BARTON	You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine ? you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
L65489	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time ?
L65486	u3865	m256	BARTON	Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
L65485	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...What's the expression ? me myself and I.
L65484	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
L65483	u3865	m256	BARTON	My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
L65482	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back ? with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
L65481	u3865	m256	BARTON	No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
L65480	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Got a sweetheart?
L65479	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	I myself have yet to be lassoed.
L65478	u3865	m256	BARTON	Nope.
L65477	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
L65476	u3865	m256	BARTON	No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
L65475	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
L65474	u3865	m256	BARTON	Seen a doctor?
L65473	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
L65472	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet ? what happened to your ear?
L65471	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
L65470	u3865	m256	BARTON	Charlie. How are you.
L65469	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Howdy, neighbor.
L65398	u3865	m256	BARTON	See you, Charlie.
L65397	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
L65396	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Well, I can tell you some stories ?
L65395	u3865	m256	BARTON	Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
L65393	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, we've got something in common then.
L65392	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
L65391	u3865	m256	BARTON	You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if ? well I know I sometimes run on.
L65389	u3865	m256	BARTON	Frequently played, seldom remarked.
L65388	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
L65387	u3865	m256	BARTON	Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man ? from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and ? and ? and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and ? well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
L65386	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	And I could tell you some stories ?
L65385	u3865	m256	BARTON	Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying ? a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
L65384	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	I can feel my butt getting sore already.
L65383	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and ? and ? and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
L65382	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
L65381	u3865	m256	BARTON	And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life ? why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
L65380	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hell, I could tell you some stories?
L65379	u3865	m256	BARTON	...I don't guess this means much to you.
L65378	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York ? hopefully our numbers are growing ? who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths ? not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
L65377	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Well ain't that a kick in the head!
L65376	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
L65375	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
L65374	u3865	m256	BARTON	What do I write about?
L65373	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
L65372	u3865	m256	BARTON	That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
L65371	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
L65370	u3865	m256	BARTON	That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies ? though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
L65369	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...Is the egg showing or what?!
L65367	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Pictures! Jesus!
L65366	u3865	m256	BARTON	No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now ?
L65365	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	What kind of scribbler are you ? newspaperman did you say?
L65364	u3865	m256	BARTON	Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
L65363	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people ? that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need ? a fella could do worse.
L65362	u3865	m256	BARTON	Doesn't surprise me at all.
L65361	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
L65360	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game ? door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
L65359	u3865	m256	BARTON	And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
L65358	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
L65357	u3865	m256	BARTON	Can be. Not easy, but ?
L65356	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
L65355	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, I'm a writer, actually.
L65354	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
L65353	u3865	m256	BARTON	That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work ?
L65352	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
L65351	u3865	m256	BARTON	Okay... a quick one, sure...
L65350	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
L65349	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
L65348	u3865	m256	BARTON	That's all right, really, thank you.
L65347	u3866	m256	CHARLIE	Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
L65993	u3865	m256	BARTON	I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US ?
L65992	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink ? you're a goddamn write-off.
L65991	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm sorry if I let you down.
L65986	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was ? well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
L65985	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yes sir.
L65984	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
L65983	u3865	m256	BARTON	With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
L65982	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
L65981	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
L65980	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yes sir, they ?
L65979	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
L65978	u3865	m256	BARTON	Congratulations.
L65977	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
L65975	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
L65974	u3865	m256	BARTON	Mr. Lipnik.
L65973	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Fink.
L65783	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
L65782	u3865	m256	BARTON	Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider ?
L65781	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
L65780	u3865	m256	BARTON	No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help ?
L65779	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	I apologize, Barton.
L65778	u3865	m256	BARTON	Mr. Lipnik, I ?
L65776	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
L65775	u3865	m256	BARTON	I ? Mr. Lipnik ?
L65765	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings ? well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town ? but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things ? if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool ? unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
L65764	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
L65763	u3865	m256	BARTON	And then... well...
L65762	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
L65761	u3865	m256	BARTON	...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
L65757	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
L65756	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah... rye whiskey?
L65336	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Both maybe?
L65335	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
L65327	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Lou.
L65326	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Yes, thank you.
L65325	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	That's okay, that's okay, that's okay ? that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing ? although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
L65324	u3865	m256	BARTON	To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik ?
L65321	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week ? that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
L65320	u3865	m256	BARTON	Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
L65319	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
L65318	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm at the Earle.
L65317	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	...Where did we put him?
L65301	u3865	m256	BARTON	The others are being sent.
L65300	u3867	m256	CLERK	...Those your only bags?
L65297	u3867	m256	CLERK	Don't you wanna go to your room?!
L65296	u3865	m256	BARTON	What ?
L65295	u3867	m256	CLERK	Okey-dokey, go ahead.
L65294	u3865	m256	BARTON	Huh?
L65293	u3867	m256	CLERK	...Okay
L65291	u3867	m256	CLERK	Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
L65290	u3865	m256	BARTON	Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
L65289	u3867	m256	CLERK	Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
L65288	u3865	m256	BARTON	I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
L65287	u3867	m256	CLERK	Transient or resident?
L65286	u3865	m256	BARTON	Excuse me?
L65285	u3867	m256	CLERK	...Are you a tranz or a rez?
L65284	u3867	m256	CLERK	Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
L65283	u3865	m256	BARTON	Must be.
L65282	u3867	m256	CLERK	F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
L65281	u3865	m256	BARTON	I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
L65280	u3867	m256	CLERK	Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
L65934	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	You're a sick fuck, Fink.
L65933	u3865	m256	BARTON	Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
L65926	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	No kidding, bright boy ? we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
L65925	u3865	m256	BARTON	Charlie... Charlie's back...
L65850	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
L65849	u3865	m256	BARTON	What did... What did he ?
L65842	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
L65841	u3865	m256	BARTON	...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
L65839	u3865	m256	BARTON	Nine days ? Tuesday ?
L65838	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Is this multiple choice?
L65835	u3865	m256	BARTON	Yeah.
L65834	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
L65822	u3865	m256	BARTON	Uh-huh.
L65821	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	L.A.P.D.
L65940	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	...Fred...
L65939	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
L65932	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	You two have some sick sex thing?
L65931	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	He teach you to do it?
L65928	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Only fry you once.
L65927	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
L65923	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Give you nose bleeds?
L65922	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
L65921	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
L65920	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Second one of your friends to end up dead.
L65917	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
L65916	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	...I thought you said you were a writer.
L65874	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
L65873	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Ya see how he's not writing it down?
L65872	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
L65868	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
L65867	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
L65863	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	But, you know, with the head still on.
L65862	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
L65861	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
L65860	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Anyway.
L65859	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Good luck with no fuckin' head.
L65858	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Physician, heal thyself.
L65857	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Well, some of his throat was there.
L65856	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	All of which he's now missin'.
L65855	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
L65854	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
L65853	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
L65848	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	He's a little funny in the head.
L65847	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Also known as Madman Mundt.
L65846	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
L65845	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
L65830	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Would that be good enough for ya?
L65829	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	You want my partner to kiss your ass?
L65828	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	Big fuckin' deal.
L65824	u3873	m256	MASTRIONOTTI	What do you do, Fink?
L65823	u3868	m256	DEUTSCH	Got a couple questions to ask ya.
L65990	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	"Look at ""Blood, Sweat, and Canvas"". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights ? both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering ? I thought we were together on that."
L65989	u3872	m256	LOU	Blood, Sweat, and Canvas.
L65988	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	"Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul ? well, all right, a little bit, for the critics ? but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at ""Hell Ten Feet Square""."
L65987	u3872	m256	LOU	Yes, Colonel.
L65774	u3872	m256	LOU	Mr. Lipnik, please ?
L65773	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
L65771	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
L65770	u3872	m256	LOU	Mr. Lipnik, I ?
L65338	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
L65337	u3872	m256	LOU	...Maybe we should do a treatment.
L65334	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
L65333	u3872	m256	LOU	No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
L65332	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	We got a treatment on it yet?
L65331	u3872	m256	LOU	Excellent picture.
L65330	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
L65323	u3871	m256	LIPNIK	How's about it, Bart?
L65322	u3872	m256	LOU	Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.

L67534	u3877	m257	ANDREWS	The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.

L67903	u3878	m257	BETH	I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
L67902	u3884	m257	NICK	Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
L67901	u3884	m257	NICK	Put your hands up!
L67900	u3878	m257	BETH	What are you doing here?
L67801	u3878	m257	BETH	She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
L67800	u3884	m257	NICK	You should do something about this lock.
L67798	u3878	m257	BETH	I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
L67797	u3884	m257	NICK	Why did you change your name?
L67796	u3878	m257	BETH	She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
L67795	u3884	m257	NICK	She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
L67794	u3878	m257	BETH	She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
L67792	u3884	m257	NICK	You saw all the reports, Beth!
L67791	u3878	m257	BETH	I had him in two classes.
L67790	u3884	m257	NICK	Did you know Noah Goldstein?
L67789	u3878	m257	BETH	I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
L67786	u3878	m257	BETH	I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
L67785	u3884	m257	NICK	What did she tell me, Beth?
L67784	u3878	m257	BETH	She told you, didn't she?
L67783	u3884	m257	NICK	Tell me about Catherine.
L67782	u3878	m257	BETH	What do you want, Nick?
L67692	u3878	m257	BETH	I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
L67691	u3884	m257	NICK	I thought you hardly know her.
L67690	u3878	m257	BETH	My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
L67689	u3884	m257	NICK	What is this interest you've got in her?
L67688	u3878	m257	BETH	Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
L67687	u3884	m257	NICK	I don't need any help.
L67686	u3878	m257	BETH	What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
L67529	u3878	m257	BETH	Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
L67528	u3884	m257	NICK	Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
L67526	u3878	m257	BETH	I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
L67525	u3884	m257	NICK	What was she like in school?
L67524	u3878	m257	BETH	She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
L67523	u3884	m257	NICK	She knows stuff about me that only you know.
L67522	u3878	m257	BETH	How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
L67521	u3884	m257	NICK	No.  I mean it, thank you.
L67520	u3878	m257	BETH	It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
L67481	u3878	m257	BETH	Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
L67480	u3884	m257	NICK	You did it for me.
L67476	u3884	m257	NICK	Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
L67475	u3878	m257	BETH	Sometimes I really hate you.
L67474	u3884	m257	NICK	I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
L67454	u3878	m257	BETH	Nilsen.
L67453	u3884	m257	NICK	Who?
L67452	u3878	m257	BETH	No, Nick, please --
L67451	u3884	m257	NICK	It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
L67450	u3884	m257	NICK	Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
L67449	u3878	m257	BETH	It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
L67447	u3884	m257	NICK	Who's got access to my goddamn file?
L67446	u3878	m257	BETH	What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
L67390	u3878	m257	BETH	I thought you quit.
L67389	u3884	m257	NICK	I need a cigarette.
L67381	u3884	m257	NICK	Why didn't you tell me?
L67380	u3878	m257	BETH	We were in some of the same classes.
L67378	u3884	m257	NICK	She said what you said she'd say.
L67377	u3878	m257	BETH	Catherine Tramell.
L67376	u3884	m257	NICK	Who?
L67375	u3878	m257	BETH	What was she like?
L67366	u3884	m257	NICK	What else is new?
L67365	u3878	m257	BETH	Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
L67364	u3884	m257	NICK	What are you doing here?
L67363	u3878	m257	BETH	You don't look so okay.
L67362	u3884	m257	NICK	Yeah.
L67361	u3878	m257	BETH	You okay?
L67159	u3884	m257	NICK	Thank you.
L67158	u3878	m257	BETH	Yes.
L67157	u3884	m257	NICK	It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
L67156	u3878	m257	BETH	How's not smoking?
L67155	u3884	m257	NICK	No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
L67154	u3878	m257	BETH	No?
L67153	u3884	m257	NICK	No.
L67152	u3878	m257	BETH	How about the coke?
L67151	u3884	m257	NICK	It's been three months.
L67150	u3878	m257	BETH	How about the booze?
L67148	u3884	m257	NICK	My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
L67147	u3878	m257	BETH	How is your -- personal life?
L67146	u3884	m257	NICK	Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
L67145	u3878	m257	BETH	So -- how are things?
L67144	u3878	m257	BETH	I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
L67143	u3884	m257	NICK	It's bullshit.  You know it is.
L67142	u3878	m257	BETH	As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
L67141	u3884	m257	NICK	I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
L67140	u3878	m257	BETH	How are you, Nick?
L67933	u3884	m257	NICK	We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
L67932	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I hate rugrats.
L67931	u3884	m257	NICK	We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
L67930	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What do we do now, Nick?
L67889	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
L67888	u3884	m257	NICK	What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
L67887	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
L67884	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I told you.  She kills him.
L67883	u3884	m257	NICK	How did it end?
L67882	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I finished my book.
L67852	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Somebody always does.
L67851	u3884	m257	NICK	Why?
L67850	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Somebody has to die.
L67849	u3884	m257	NICK	Why not?
L67848	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	It won't sell.
L67847	u3884	m257	NICK	They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
L67846	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What happens to them?
L67845	u3884	m257	NICK	A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
L67844	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Really.  What are you writing about.
L67843	u3884	m257	NICK	I'm writing a book.
L67842	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What are you researching?
L67841	u3884	m257	NICK	No thanks.
L67840	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
L67839	u3884	m257	NICK	I have to do some research tomorrow.
L67834	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Come over here and tell me no.
L67833	u3884	m257	NICK	No.
L67832	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Did you miss me?
L67831	u3884	m257	NICK	You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
L67830	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
L67829	u3884	m257	NICK	How'd you get in here?
L67811	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Liar.
L67810	u3884	m257	NICK	No.
L67809	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You still think I kill people, don't you?
L67807	u3884	m257	NICK	I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
L67806	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
L67805	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Did you?  What's she doing?
L67804	u3884	m257	NICK	I found Lisa Henderson.
L67803	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
L67766	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Of course I knew.
L67765	u3884	m257	NICK	You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
L67763	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
L67762	u3884	m257	NICK	Can I talk to you a minute?
L67735	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Funny.
L67734	u3884	m257	NICK	He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
L67733	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What did he say?
L67728	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I'll convince you.
L67727	u3884	m257	NICK	I don't know.
L67726	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Do you believe me?
L67725	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
L67724	u3884	m257	NICK	What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
L67723	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
L67722	u3884	m257	NICK	You paid $50,000 for your character?
L67721	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
L67720	u3884	m257	NICK	Why?
L67719	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	About three months before I met you.
L67718	u3884	m257	NICK	When?
L67717	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
L67716	u3884	m257	NICK	Try me.
L67715	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You won't believe me.
L67713	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
L67712	u3884	m257	NICK	No?
L67711	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	No.
L67708	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I never have before.
L67707	u3884	m257	NICK	I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
L67706	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
L67705	u3884	m257	NICK	Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
L67704	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
L67703	u3884	m257	NICK	Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
L67702	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Make love to me.
L67701	u3884	m257	NICK	It's OK.  It's OK.
L67700	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Everybody that I care about dies.
L67699	u3884	m257	NICK	No.
L67698	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Do you think I told her to kill You?
L67697	u3884	m257	NICK	Did you like her to watch?
L67696	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
L67640	u3884	m257	NICK	I know.
L67639	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You're in over your head.
L67638	u3884	m257	NICK	I don't have a choice.
L67637	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You shouldn't play this game.
L67636	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I told you I had a vivid imagination.
L67635	u3884	m257	NICK	I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
L67631	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
L67630	u3884	m257	NICK	Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
L67628	u3884	m257	NICK	It hurts.
L67627	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Fine.  How's your back?
L67626	u3884	m257	NICK	How's your shoulder?
L67623	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Do you want her to join us sometime?
L67622	u3884	m257	NICK	How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
L67621	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
L67620	u3884	m257	NICK	What did you think?
L67619	u3884	m257	NICK	I told her it was the fuck of the century.
L67618	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Did you think it was so special?
L67616	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	She's seen everything before.
L67615	u3884	m257	NICK	Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
L67601	u3884	m257	NICK	I'll meet you there.
L67600	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
L67598	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
L67597	u3884	m257	NICK	How's your new book?
L67596	u3884	m257	NICK	To see if I can get away with it.
L67595	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Why take the risk?
L67594	u3884	m257	NICK	I'll risk it.
L67593	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
L67592	u3884	m257	NICK	No.
L67591	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
L67590	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
L67589	u3884	m257	NICK	Yes.
L67588	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You mean did I write it before my parents died?
L67587	u3884	m257	NICK	When did you write it?
L67586	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	To see if he can get away with it.
L67585	u3884	m257	NICK	Why does he do it?
L67584	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
L67583	u3884	m257	NICK	What's it about?
L67582	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Aren't you going to thank me?
L67580	u3884	m257	NICK	What do you want from me, Catherine?
L67579	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	"Say -- ""What do you want from me, Catherine?"""
L67577	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	It's not the same thing, is it?
L67576	u3884	m257	NICK	There's Pepsi in the fridge.
L67575	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
L67574	u3884	m257	NICK	What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
L67573	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
L67572	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I know, Nicky, but I like it.
L67571	u3884	m257	NICK	My wife used to call me that.
L67570	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What if I call you Nicky?
L67569	u3884	m257	NICK	What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
L67568	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
L67567	u3884	m257	NICK	What did you pay Nilsen?
L67562	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Please.
L67561	u3884	m257	NICK	Ice?
L67560	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Fine.
L67559	u3884	m257	NICK	Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
L67557	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Not me.
L67556	u3884	m257	NICK	You can make a mistake.
L67555	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Why not?
L67554	u3884	m257	NICK	Don't get too cocky.
L67553	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
L67550	u3884	m257	NICK	Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
L67549	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Do you?
L67548	u3884	m257	NICK	I like you.
L67547	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
L67546	u3884	m257	NICK	I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
L67545	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
L67544	u3884	m257	NICK	How exactly did you hear?
L67439	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
L67438	u3884	m257	NICK	I didn't.
L67435	u3884	m257	NICK	No.
L67434	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
L67433	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
L67432	u3884	m257	NICK	Didn't you study it in school?
L67431	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
L67430	u3884	m257	NICK	She wiped out her whole family.

L67316	u3884	m257	NICK	Why not?
L67315	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.

L67267	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Yes it does, doesn't it?
L67266	u3884	m257	NICK	Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.

L67263	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

L67255	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	No.

L67252	u3880	m257	CORRIGAN	Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
L67250	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
L67249	u3880	m257	CORRIGAN	Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
L67248	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
L67247	u3880	m257	CORRIGAN	There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
L67238	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	No thank you.

L67301	u3882	m257	GUS	That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

L67232	u3882	m257	GUS	"I like that.  ""Suspension of Disbelief."""
L67231	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
L67230	u3882	m257	GUS	How's that?
L67229	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	It teaches you to lie.
L67228	u3882	m257	GUS	It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
L67227	u3879	m257	CATHERINE	Yes I am.

L67875	u3881	m257	DETECTIVE	The usual -- a girlfriend.
L67874	u3884	m257	NICK	What kind of talk?
L67873	u3881	m257	DETECTIVE	Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
L67872	u3884	m257	NICK	Was she ever a suspect?
L67871	u3881	m257	DETECTIVE	That's him.
L67870	u3884	m257	NICK	Nilsen?

L67866	u3884	m257	NICK	Routine.
L67865	u3881	m257	DETECTIVE	I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
L67864	u3884	m257	NICK	Was his wife ever a suspect?
L67863	u3881	m257	DETECTIVE	No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.

L67822	u3882	m257	GUS	How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
L67821	u3884	m257	NICK	Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
L67820	u3882	m257	GUS	If she's telling  you the truth.
L67819	u3884	m257	NICK	Catherine told me what was in it.

L67664	u3884	m257	NICK	It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
L67661	u3882	m257	GUS	That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
L67660	u3884	m257	NICK	I don't know.  I'm just not.

L67347	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
L67346	u3882	m257	GUS	Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
L67068	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
L67067	u3882	m257	GUS	Maybe the maid did it.
L67744	u3886	m257	THE WOMAN	She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
L67743	u3882	m257	GUS	What was the motive?

L67678	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	I told you to stay away from Tramell.
L67677	u3884	m257	NICK	Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
L67676	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	You knew her, didn't you?
L67674	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
L67673	u3884	m257	NICK	I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?

L67540	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.

L67538	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?

L67344	u3884	m257	NICK	How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
L67343	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
L67342	u3884	m257	NICK	Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
L67341	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
L67340	u3884	m257	NICK	She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
L67339	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.

L67327	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	"What is all this ""Nick"" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride."
L67196	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	We bring her in for questioning.
L67195	u3884	m257	NICK	So what do we do -- nothing?
L67178	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
L67177	u3884	m257	NICK	I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.

L67265	u3883	m257	LT. WALKER	Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
L67264	u3885	m257	TALCOTT	We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.

My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
L83266	u4045	m268	SETHE	You remember Halle.
L83265	u4037	m268	BABY SUGGS	What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back?

Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.

L83405	u4039	m268	DENVER	..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
L83512	u4045	m268	SETHE	No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..

L83501	u4038	m268	BELOVED	You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
L83500	u4045	m268	SETHE	Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
L83499	u4038	m268	BELOVED	You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
L83498	u4045	m268	SETHE	Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
L83497	u4038	m268	BELOVED	I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
L83496	u4045	m268	SETHE	Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
L83495	u4038	m268	BELOVED	You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!

L83570	u4041	m268	JANEY	They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
L83569	u4039	m268	DENVER	Ya think?
L83568	u4041	m268	JANEY	Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.

L83552	u4039	m268	DENVER	May I come in?
L83551	u4041	m268	JANEY	Yes?
L83540	u4039	m268	DENVER	No..No that won't do...
L83539	u4042	m268	LADY JONES	Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
L83538	u4039	m268	DENVER	Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
L83537	u4042	m268	LADY JONES	Extra?
L83536	u4039	m268	DENVER	I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.

L83481	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	All he can. All he can.
L83480	u4043	m268	PAUL	Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
L83479	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?

L83476	u4043	m268	PAUL	She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
L83475	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
L83474	u4043	m268	PAUL	Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
L83473	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	She was only-
L83472	u4043	m268	PAUL	Leave off..
L83471	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
L83470	u4043	m268	PAUL	You don't know what I think.
L83469	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	It ain't what you think.
L83468	u4043	m268	PAUL	Jesus.

L83466	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
L83465	u4043	m268	PAUL	I don't want to know.
L83464	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
L83463	u4043	m268	PAUL	There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
L83462	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	I don't believe that. I won't.
L83461	u4043	m268	PAUL	They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
L83460	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
L83459	u4043	m268	PAUL	Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
L83458	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	No use thinking these things now.
L83457	u4043	m268	PAUL	I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
L83456	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	Never found out.
L83455	u4043	m268	PAUL	You remember your price, Stamp?
L83446	u4043	m268	PAUL	Oh yeah. I got big plans.
L83445	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	You planning to do anything about it?

L83442	u4043	m268	PAUL	Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
L83441	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
L83440	u4043	m268	PAUL	For what?
L83439	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
L83438	u4043	m268	PAUL	If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
L83437	u4046	m268	STAMP PAID	This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
L83645	u4045	m268	SETHE	She was my best thing.
L83644	u4043	m268	PAUL	Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
L83643	u4045	m268	SETHE	She left me. She's gone again.
L83642	u4043	m268	PAUL	What, baby?

L83637	u4043	m268	PAUL	You got to get up from here, girl.
L83636	u4045	m268	SETHE	She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
L83635	u4043	m268	PAUL	Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
L83634	u4045	m268	SETHE	No, You looking good.
L83633	u4043	m268	PAUL	Yeah. Look bad?

Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
L84945	u4050	m269	BRANDT	That had not occurred to us, Dude.
L84936	u4057	m269	DUDE	No, man, nothing is fucked here--
L84935	u4050	m269	BRANDT	This is our concern, Dude.
L84731	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
L84730	u4057	m269	DUDE	Shit.
L84729	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
L84728	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh, man, don't say that..
L84727	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Her life is in your hands.
L84726	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.
L84725	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
L84724	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh, nothin', you know.
L84723	u4050	m269	BRANDT	They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
L84673	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Well Dude, we just don't know.
L84672	u4057	m269	DUDE	So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
L84671	u4050	m269	BRANDT	He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
L84670	u4057	m269	DUDE	Why me, man?
L84669	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
L84649	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh.
L84648	u4050	m269	BRANDT	We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
L84557	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
L84556	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
L84555	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's the LeBaron.
L84554	u4050	m269	BRANDT	Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
L85217	u4051	m269	CHIEF	Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
L85216	u4057	m269	DUDE	That guy treats women like objects, man.
L85215	u4051	m269	CHIEF	Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
L85214	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.
L85213	u4051	m269	CHIEF	What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
L85212	u4057	m269	DUDE	I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
L85211	u4051	m269	CHIEF	You don't know shit, Lebowski.
L85210	u4057	m269	DUDE	I know my rights.
L85312	u4052	m269	DA FINO	Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
L85311	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, it sucks.
L85310	u4052	m269	DA FINO	Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
L85308	u4052	m269	DA FINO	Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
L85307	u4057	m269	DUDE	Jesus fucking Christ.
L85305	u4052	m269	DA FINO	The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
L85304	u4057	m269	DUDE	The?  Who the fff--
L85303	u4052	m269	DA FINO	The Gundersons.
L85302	u4057	m269	DUDE	Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
L85301	u4052	m269	DA FINO	Hey, man, I'm not--
L85300	u4057	m269	DUDE	She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
L85299	u4052	m269	DA FINO	Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
L85298	u4057	m269	DUDE	I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
L85297	u4052	m269	DA FINO	A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
L85439	u4065	m269	WALTER	ANTI-SEMITE!

L85481	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
L85480	u4054	m269	DONNELLY	Sir, please lower your voice--
L85476	u4054	m269	DONNELLY	Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
L85475	u4057	m269	DUDE	Can we just rent it from you?
L85460	u4054	m269	DONNELLY	Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
L85459	u4057	m269	DUDE	Nothing.

L85469	u4065	m269	WALTER	This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
L85468	u4054	m269	DONNELLY	Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
L85467	u4065	m269	WALTER	Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
L85466	u4054	m269	DONNELLY	That is for the urn.
L85465	u4065	m269	WALTER	What's this?
L85462	u4054	m269	DONNELLY	We have the urn.

L84700	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.
L84695	u4057	m269	DUDE	Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
L84694	u4055	m269	DONNY	What do you mean, Dude?
L84490	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.

L84486	u4055	m269	DONNY	And this guy peed on it.
L84485	u4057	m269	DUDE	Fuckin' A.

L84469	u4055	m269	DONNY	What the fuck is he talking about?
L85419	u4065	m269	WALTER	They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
L85418	u4055	m269	DONNY	Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
L85393	u4065	m269	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
L85392	u4055	m269	DONNY	Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
L85123	u4065	m269	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
L85122	u4055	m269	DONNY	We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
L85121	u4065	m269	WALTER	What have you.  We'll, uh--
L85104	u4065	m269	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
L85103	u4055	m269	DONNY	Those are good burgers, Walter.
L85035	u4065	m269	WALTER	You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
L85034	u4055	m269	DONNY	What do you need that for, Dude?
L85022	u4055	m269	DONNY	Well--
L85021	u4065	m269	WALTER	Am I wrong?
L85020	u4055	m269	DONNY	No--
L85019	u4065	m269	WALTER	Are you gonna split hairs?
L85018	u4055	m269	DONNY	Uh-huh.
L85017	u4065	m269	WALTER	Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
L85016	u4055	m269	DONNY	They were Nazis, Dude?
L85015	u4065	m269	WALTER	Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
L85005	u4065	m269	WALTER	Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.

L84845	u4055	m269	DONNY	Who has your undies, Walter?
L84840	u4065	m269	WALTER	Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
L84839	u4055	m269	DONNY	Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
L84838	u4065	m269	WALTER	Kill that poor woman.

L84691	u4055	m269	DONNY	What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
L84690	u4065	m269	WALTER	Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
L84689	u4055	m269	DONNY	If what's during league play?
L84681	u4065	m269	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.
L84680	u4055	m269	DONNY	What's a pederast, Walter?
L84478	u4065	m269	WALTER	YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
L84477	u4055	m269	DONNY	He peed on the Dude's rug--
L84466	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?
L84465	u4055	m269	DONNY	Yeah Walter, what's your point?
L84462	u4065	m269	WALTER	So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
L84461	u4055	m269	DONNY	I was bowling--
L84460	u4065	m269	WALTER	Were you listening to the Dude's story?

L84921	u4056	m269	DRIVER	"--So he says, ""My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."""
L84525	u4057	m269	DUDE	--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

L84518	u4067	m269	YOUNG MAN	--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
L84517	u4057	m269	DUDE	I see.
L84516	u4067	m269	YOUNG MAN	They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--

L84507	u4057	m269	DUDE	Far out.
L84506	u4067	m269	YOUNG MAN	Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.

L84502	u4067	m269	YOUNG MAN	That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
L84501	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey, is this him with Nancy?
L84500	u4067	m269	YOUNG MAN	That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
L84499	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.
L84498	u4067	m269	YOUNG MAN	That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.

L84874	u4057	m269	DUDE	And the, uh, the briefcase?
L84873	u4068	m269	YOUNGER COP	Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
L84870	u4068	m269	YOUNGER COP	Separate incidents?
L84869	u4057	m269	DUDE	No.  Here.
L84868	u4068	m269	YOUNGER COP	Your rug was in the car.
L84867	u4057	m269	DUDE	...Also, my rug was stolen.
L84866	u4057	m269	DUDE	...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.

L85059	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.  Thanks man.
L85058	u4062	m269	THE STRANGER	Take it easy, Dude.
L85055	u4062	m269	THE STRANGER	Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
L85054	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
L85053	u4062	m269	THE STRANGER	I like your style, Dude.
L85051	u4057	m269	DUDE	Mm.
L85050	u4062	m269	THE STRANGER	Far from it.
L85049	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
L85048	u4062	m269	THE STRANGER	One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
L85047	u4057	m269	DUDE	Ahh, not so good, man.
L85203	u4057	m269	DUDE	Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
L85202	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
L85201	u4057	m269	DUDE	Does the Pope shit in the woods?
L85200	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
L85199	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
L85198	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
L85197	u4057	m269	DUDE	But she hasn't run off, she's been--
L85196	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
L85195	u4057	m269	DUDE	I thought you might know, man.
L85194	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
L85193	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
L85192	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
L85191	u4057	m269	DUDE	On you, maybe.
L85190	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
L85189	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
L85188	u4057	m269	DUDE	Which one was Logjammin'?
L85187	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
L85186	u4057	m269	DUDE	White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
L85185	u4063	m269	TREEHORN	What's your drink, Dude?
L85184	u4057	m269	DUDE	This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
L85455	u4057	m269	DUDE	Jeffrey Lebowski.
L85454	u4059	m269	MAN	Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
L85453	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah man.
L85452	u4059	m269	MAN	Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
L85296	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?
L85295	u4059	m269	MAN	Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
L85294	u4057	m269	DUDE	Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
L85293	u4059	m269	MAN	Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
L85292	u4057	m269	DUDE	Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
L85291	u4059	m269	MAN	Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
L85290	u4057	m269	DUDE	Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
L85173	u4059	m269	MAN	I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
L85172	u4057	m269	DUDE	No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
L85273	u4060	m269	MAUDE	What?
L85272	u4057	m269	DUDE	No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
L85271	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
L85270	u4057	m269	DUDE	So...that doctor.
L85269	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh...
L85268	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
L85267	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
L85266	u4060	m269	MAUDE	I want a child.
L85265	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well...no, of course not--
L85264	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
L85263	u4057	m269	DUDE	Increases?
L85261	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
L85260	u4060	m269	MAUDE	He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
L85259	u4057	m269	DUDE	But he's--
L85258	u4060	m269	MAUDE	We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
L85257	u4057	m269	DUDE	But your father--he runs stuff, he--
L85256	u4060	m269	MAUDE	No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
L85255	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
L85254	u4060	m269	MAUDE	I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
L85253	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
L85252	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Jeffrey--
L85251	u4057	m269	DUDE	Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
L85250	u4060	m269	MAUDE	It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
L85249	u4057	m269	DUDE	He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
L85248	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Finder's fee?
L85247	u4057	m269	DUDE	Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
L85246	u4060	m269	MAUDE	What happened to your house?
L85245	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback.
L85244	u4060	m269	MAUDE	What do you do for fun?
L85243	u4057	m269	DUDE	Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
L85242	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Uh-huh.
L85241	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
L85240	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Oh?
L85239	u4057	m269	DUDE	And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
L85238	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Mmnun.
L85237	u4057	m269	DUDE	Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
L85236	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Uh-huh.
L85235	u4057	m269	DUDE	I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
L85234	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
L85233	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
L85230	u4057	m269	DUDE	Maude?
L85229	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Jeffrey.
L85093	u4060	m269	MAUDE	I want you to see him immediately.
L85092	u4057	m269	DUDE	Delayed after-eff--
L85091	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
L85090	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
L85089	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Do you still have that doctor's number?
L85088	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
L85087	u4060	m269	MAUDE	So Dieter has the money?
L85086	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well yeah...I know that.
L85085	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
L85084	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well...yeah--
L85083	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Is he pretending to be the abductor?
L85082	u4057	m269	DUDE	Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
L85080	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
L85079	u4057	m269	DUDE	Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
L85077	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
L85076	u4057	m269	DUDE	Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
L85075	u4060	m269	MAUDE	"Her ""co-star"" in the beaver picture?"
L85074	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well--yeah, I guess--
L85073	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Dieter Hauff?
L85072	u4057	m269	DUDE	The main guy, Dieter--
L85071	u4060	m269	MAUDE	From who?
L85070	u4057	m269	DUDE	I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
L85069	u4060	m269	MAUDE	She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
L85068	u4057	m269	DUDE	Now I got--
L85067	u4060	m269	MAUDE	And please don't call her my mother.
L85066	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
L85065	u4060	m269	MAUDE	She most certainly was not!
L85064	u4057	m269	DUDE	I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
L85063	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
L85062	u4057	m269	DUDE	No it's fine, really, uh--
L85061	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
L84920	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
L84919	u4057	m269	DUDE	That's really thoughtful but I--
L84918	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
L84917	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
L84916	u4060	m269	MAUDE	--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
L84915	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, but what about--
L84914	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
L84913	u4057	m269	DUDE	A hundred.
L84912	u4060	m269	MAUDE	If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
L84911	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well--sure, I could do that--
L84910	u4060	m269	MAUDE	I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
L84909	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, but my-
L84908	u4060	m269	MAUDE	"Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this ""abduction"", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive"
L84907	u4057	m269	DUDE	Shit yeah, the achievers.
L84906	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
L84905	u4057	m269	DUDE	He fixes the cable?
L84904	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
L84897	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Take a look at this, sir.
L84896	u4057	m269	DUDE	Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
L84895	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
L84894	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh, no.
L84893	u4060	m269	MAUDE	I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
L84892	u4057	m269	DUDE	You mean coitus?
L84891	u4060	m269	MAUDE	You're not interested in sex?
L84890	u4057	m269	DUDE	I was talking about my rug.
L84889	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
L84888	u4057	m269	DUDE	Excuse me?
L84887	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
L84886	u4057	m269	DUDE	Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
L84885	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
L84884	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?
L84883	u4060	m269	MAUDE	Thank you.
L84882	u4057	m269	DUDE	Johnson?
L84881	u4060	m269	MAUDE	"Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his ""dick"" or his ""rod"" or his ""Johnson""."
L84880	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh yeah?
L84879	u4060	m269	MAUDE	In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
L84878	u4057	m269	DUDE	Is that what that's a picture of?
L85499	u4057	m269	DUDE	You're a fuck, Walter!
L85498	u4065	m269	WALTER	Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
L85497	u4057	m269	DUDE	What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
L85496	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude, I'm sorry--
L85495	u4057	m269	DUDE	What about that shit about Vietnam!
L85494	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
L85493	u4057	m269	DUDE	You make everything a fucking travesty!
L85492	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
L85491	u4057	m269	DUDE	Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
L85479	u4065	m269	WALTER	JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
L85478	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter--
L85477	u4065	m269	WALTER	We're scattering the fucking ashes!
L85472	u4065	m269	WALTER	A hundred and eighty dollars?!
L85471	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well can we--
L85457	u4057	m269	DUDE	The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
L85456	u4065	m269	WALTER	Walter Sobchak.
L85450	u4065	m269	WALTER	Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
L85449	u4057	m269	DUDE	Wha. . . Donny--
L85448	u4065	m269	WALTER	Call the medics, Dude.
L85447	u4057	m269	DUDE	Wha.
L85446	u4065	m269	WALTER	It's a heart attack.
L85445	u4057	m269	DUDE	Then what's...
L85444	u4065	m269	WALTER	There weren't any shots.
L85443	u4057	m269	DUDE	They shot Donny!
L85442	u4065	m269	WALTER	No Dude.
L85441	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
L85424	u4057	m269	DUDE	Come on, Walter!.
L85423	u4065	m269	WALTER	What's mine is mine.
L85417	u4065	m269	WALTER	AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
L85416	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
L85410	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey, cool it Walter.
L85409	u4065	m269	WALTER	Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
L85391	u4065	m269	WALTER	That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
L85390	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.
L85389	u4065	m269	WALTER	I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
L85388	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.
L85387	u4065	m269	WALTER	Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
L85384	u4057	m269	DUDE	We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
L85383	u4065	m269	WALTER	Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
L85382	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, you fuck!
L85377	u4065	m269	WALTER	Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
L85376	u4057	m269	DUDE	He can't walk, Walter!
L85375	u4065	m269	WALTER	Oh, shit.
L85372	u4065	m269	WALTER	Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
L85371	u4057	m269	DUDE	WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
L85370	u4065	m269	WALTER	It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
L85358	u4057	m269	DUDE	You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
L85357	u4065	m269	WALTER	AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
L85340	u4065	m269	WALTER	Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
L85339	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
L85338	u4065	m269	WALTER	I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
L85337	u4057	m269	DUDE	This driveway.
L85336	u4065	m269	WALTER	Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
L85335	u4057	m269	DUDE	And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
L85334	u4065	m269	WALTER	You know this!
L85333	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, and you were--
L85332	u4065	m269	WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
L85331	u4057	m269	DUDE	You're fucking Polish Catholic--
L85330	u4065	m269	WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about?
L85329	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
L85328	u4065	m269	WALTER	I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
L85327	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?
L85326	u4065	m269	WALTER	Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
L85325	u4057	m269	DUDE	Shit yeah!
L85324	u4065	m269	WALTER	Yeah?
L85323	u4057	m269	DUDE	His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
L85322	u4065	m269	WALTER	What's your point, Dude?
L85321	u4057	m269	DUDE	I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
L85320	u4065	m269	WALTER	Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
L85319	u4057	m269	DUDE	I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
L85287	u4057	m269	DUDE	WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
L85286	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
L85285	u4057	m269	DUDE	THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
L85284	u4065	m269	WALTER	I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
L85283	u4057	m269	DUDE	It is a fucking emergency.
L85282	u4065	m269	WALTER	Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
L85281	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?
L85280	u4065	m269	WALTER	I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
L85279	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
L85278	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude?
L85277	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
L85156	u4065	m269	WALTER	And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
L85155	u4057	m269	DUDE	And the fucking money!
L85154	u4065	m269	WALTER	You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
L85153	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
L85152	u4065	m269	WALTER	Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
L85151	u4057	m269	DUDE	We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
L85150	u4065	m269	WALTER	Is this your homework, Larry?
L85149	u4057	m269	DUDE	Is the car out front yours?
L85148	u4065	m269	WALTER	Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
L85147	u4057	m269	DUDE	Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
L85146	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
L85145	u4057	m269	DUDE	Look, man, did you--
L85144	u4065	m269	WALTER	Is this your homework, Larry?
L85125	u4065	m269	WALTER	Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
L85124	u4057	m269	DUDE	Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
L85120	u4065	m269	WALTER	Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
L85119	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh.
L85118	u4065	m269	WALTER	And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
L85117	u4057	m269	DUDE	No.
L85116	u4065	m269	WALTER	Not exactly a lightweight.
L85115	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.
L85114	u4065	m269	WALTER	The bulk of the series.
L85113	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uh-huh.
L85112	u4065	m269	WALTER	Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
L85111	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
L85110	u4065	m269	WALTER	All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
L85109	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.
L85108	u4065	m269	WALTER	Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
L85107	u4057	m269	DUDE	Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
L85106	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?
L85105	u4057	m269	DUDE	Who the fuck is that?
L85102	u4065	m269	WALTER	Near the In-and-Out Burger--
L85101	u4057	m269	DUDE	The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
L85100	u4065	m269	WALTER	He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
L85033	u4057	m269	DUDE	Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
L85032	u4065	m269	WALTER	--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
L85031	u4057	m269	DUDE	Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
L85030	u4065	m269	WALTER	No, I'm--
L85029	u4057	m269	DUDE	What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
L85028	u4065	m269	WALTER	And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
L85027	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.
L85026	u4065	m269	WALTER	Nihilists!  Jesus.
L85025	u4057	m269	DUDE	They kept saying they believe in nothing.
L85024	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?
L85023	u4057	m269	DUDE	They're nihilists.
L85014	u4057	m269	DUDE	This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
L85013	u4065	m269	WALTER	Now Dude--
L85012	u4057	m269	DUDE	That makes me feel all warm inside.
L85011	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude--
L85010	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
L85009	u4065	m269	WALTER	Not if I have anything to say about it.
L85008	u4057	m269	DUDE	Thanks Walter.
L85007	u4065	m269	WALTER	Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
L85006	u4057	m269	DUDE	I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
L84972	u4065	m269	WALTER	Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
L84971	u4057	m269	DUDE	All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
L84970	u4065	m269	WALTER	Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
L84965	u4065	m269	WALTER	FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
L84964	u4057	m269	DUDE	What about the toe?
L84963	u4065	m269	WALTER	Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
L84962	u4057	m269	DUDE	They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
L84961	u4065	m269	WALTER	I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
L84960	u4057	m269	DUDE	But Walter--
L84959	u4065	m269	WALTER	You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
L84958	u4057	m269	DUDE	Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
L84957	u4065	m269	WALTER	Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
L84956	u4057	m269	DUDE	The nail polish, Walter.
L84955	u4065	m269	WALTER	How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
L84954	u4057	m269	DUDE	Whose toe was it, Walter?
L84953	u4065	m269	WALTER	That wasn't her toe.
L84851	u4057	m269	DUDE	Aw, fuck it.
L84850	u4065	m269	WALTER	Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
L84849	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
L84848	u4065	m269	WALTER	Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
L84847	u4057	m269	DUDE	You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
L84844	u4065	m269	WALTER	And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
L84843	u4057	m269	DUDE	Our car, Walter?
L84842	u4065	m269	WALTER	Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
L84841	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter--
L84837	u4065	m269	WALTER	"Yeah yeah, ""kill that poor woman."""
L84836	u4057	m269	DUDE	But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
L84833	u4065	m269	WALTER	For Christ's sake, Dude.
L84832	u4057	m269	DUDE	That's it.  I'm out of here.
L84828	u4065	m269	WALTER	Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
L84827	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
L84823	u4065	m269	WALTER	C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
L84822	u4057	m269	DUDE	Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
L84817	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter--
L84816	u4065	m269	WALTER	I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
L84815	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
L84810	u4065	m269	WALTER	That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
L84809	u4057	m269	DUDE	No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
L84808	u4065	m269	WALTER	What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
L84807	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
L84806	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
L84805	u4057	m269	DUDE	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
L84804	u4065	m269	WALTER	Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
L84799	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, please--
L84798	u4065	m269	WALTER	You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
L84797	u4057	m269	DUDE	Uzi?
L84796	u4065	m269	WALTER	Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
L84795	u4057	m269	DUDE	What the fuck?
L84794	u4065	m269	WALTER	Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
L84793	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter!
L84792	u4065	m269	WALTER	Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
L84791	u4057	m269	DUDE	Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
L84790	u4065	m269	WALTER	The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
L84789	u4057	m269	DUDE	I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
L84788	u4065	m269	WALTER	Wooden bridge, huh?
L84787	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
L84786	u4065	m269	WALTER	We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
L84785	u4057	m269	DUDE	We throw the money out of the moving car!
L84784	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?
L84783	u4057	m269	DUDE	There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
L84782	u4065	m269	WALTER	What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
L84781	u4057	m269	DUDE	FUCK.
L84778	u4065	m269	WALTER	Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
L84777	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
L84776	u4065	m269	WALTER	...Huh?
L84775	u4065	m269	WALTER	That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
L84774	u4057	m269	DUDE	Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
L84773	u4065	m269	WALTER	Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
L84765	u4065	m269	WALTER	Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
L84764	u4057	m269	DUDE	Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
L84763	u4065	m269	WALTER	Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
L84762	u4065	m269	WALTER	Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
L84761	u4057	m269	DUDE	We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
L84760	u4065	m269	WALTER	Easy, Dude.
L84759	u4057	m269	DUDE	They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
L84758	u4065	m269	WALTER	What the fuck is going on there?
L84757	u4057	m269	DUDE	Oh shit.  Walter.
L84745	u4065	m269	WALTER	It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
L84744	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
L84743	u4065	m269	WALTER	My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
L84742	u4057	m269	DUDE	We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
L84741	u4065	m269	WALTER	Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
L84740	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
L84739	u4065	m269	WALTER	Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
L84738	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
L84737	u4057	m269	DUDE	Agh--
L84736	u4065	m269	WALTER	My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
L84735	u4057	m269	DUDE	What the hell is this?
L84734	u4065	m269	WALTER	The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
L84733	u4057	m269	DUDE	The what?
L84714	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's your roll.
L84713	u4065	m269	WALTER	The fucking point is--
L84712	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's your roll--
L84711	u4065	m269	WALTER	Have it your way.  The point is--
L84710	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
L84709	u4065	m269	WALTER	Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
L84708	u4057	m269	DUDE	I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
L84707	u4065	m269	WALTER	Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
L84697	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
L84696	u4065	m269	WALTER	That...fucking...bitch!
L84693	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?
L84692	u4057	m269	DUDE	I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
L84688	u4057	m269	DUDE	I told him if it was during league play--
L84687	u4065	m269	WALTER	What if it's during a game?
L84686	u4057	m269	DUDE	...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
L84685	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah.
L84684	u4065	m269	WALTER	Just for making the hand-off?
L84683	u4057	m269	DUDE	Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
L84682	u4065	m269	WALTER	Anyway.  How much they offer you?
L84679	u4065	m269	WALTER	When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
L84678	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh.
L84677	u4065	m269	WALTER	The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
L84676	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?
L84675	u4065	m269	WALTER	Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
L84631	u4065	m269	WALTER	Calmer than you are.
L84630	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
L84629	u4065	m269	WALTER	I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
L84628	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well, just take 't easy, man.
L84627	u4065	m269	WALTER	That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
L84626	u4057	m269	DUDE	Just, just take it easy, Walter.
L84625	u4065	m269	WALTER	Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
L84624	u4057	m269	DUDE	You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
L84623	u4065	m269	WALTER	Am I wrong!
L84622	u4057	m269	DUDE	No, you're not wrong--
L84621	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
L84620	u4057	m269	DUDE	He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
L84619	u4065	m269	WALTER	You mean--beyond pacifism?
L84618	u4057	m269	DUDE	And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
L84617	u4065	m269	WALTER	You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
L84616	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
L84610	u4065	m269	WALTER	MARK IT ZERO!
L84609	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
L84604	u4065	m269	WALTER	Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
L84603	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey Walter--
L84602	u4065	m269	WALTER	Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
L84598	u4065	m269	WALTER	This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
L84597	u4057	m269	DUDE	Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
L84590	u4065	m269	WALTER	Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
L84589	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey man--
L84588	u4065	m269	WALTER	First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
L84587	u4057	m269	DUDE	Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
L84586	u4065	m269	WALTER	"What do you mean ""brought it bowling""? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude."
L84585	u4057	m269	DUDE	You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
L84584	u4065	m269	WALTER	I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
L84583	u4057	m269	DUDE	What the fuck are you--
L84582	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
L84581	u4057	m269	DUDE	What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
L84580	u4065	m269	WALTER	State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
L84579	u4057	m269	DUDE	Huh?
L84578	u4065	m269	WALTER	Theodore Herzel.
L84577	u4057	m269	DUDE	You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
L84576	u4065	m269	WALTER	Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
L84488	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
L84487	u4065	m269	WALTER	Donny!  Please!
L84484	u4065	m269	WALTER	Okay. That, uh.
L84483	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah, but--
L84482	u4065	m269	WALTER	Am I wrong!
L84481	u4057	m269	DUDE	No, but--
L84480	u4065	m269	WALTER	Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
L84479	u4057	m269	DUDE	So who--
L84476	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, he peed on my rug--
L84475	u4065	m269	WALTER	What the fuck are you--
L84474	u4057	m269	DUDE	Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
L84473	u4065	m269	WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
L84472	u4057	m269	DUDE	This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
L84471	u4065	m269	WALTER	Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
L84468	u4065	m269	WALTER	Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
L84467	u4057	m269	DUDE	What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
L84464	u4065	m269	WALTER	There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
L84463	u4057	m269	DUDE	What's your point, Walter?
L84456	u4065	m269	WALTER	This was a valued, uh.
L84455	u4057	m269	DUDE	Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
L84454	u4065	m269	WALTER	This was, uh--

L85040	u4064	m269	VOICE	Right, Dude.
L85039	u4057	m269	DUDE	Another Caucasian, Gary.

L84635	u4057	m269	DUDE	Shit!
L84634	u4064	m269	VOICE	Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
L84431	u4057	m269	DUDE	It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
L84430	u4064	m269	VOICE	WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

L85361	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	All right, get out.  Both of you.
L85360	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well. . . yeah.
L85359	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Well?  Aren't you?
L85356	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
L85355	u4057	m269	DUDE	We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
L85351	u4057	m269	DUDE	Where's the money, Lebowski?
L85350	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
L84948	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
L84947	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Brandt, give him the envelope.
L84944	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
L84943	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
L84942	u4057	m269	DUDE	I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
L84941	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
L84940	u4057	m269	DUDE	I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
L84939	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	WHAT?!
L84938	u4057	m269	DUDE	C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
L84934	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
L84933	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well we--I don't--
L84932	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
L84663	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
L84662	u4057	m269	DUDE	Fuckin' A.
L84661	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
L84660	u4057	m269	DUDE	'Scuse me?
L84659	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Bunny.
L84658	u4057	m269	DUDE	Mind if I smoke a jay?
L84656	u4057	m269	DUDE	Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
L84655	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
L84654	u4057	m269	DUDE	I don't know, sir.
L84653	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Huh?
L84652	u4057	m269	DUDE	Dude.
L84651	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
L84548	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
L84547	u4057	m269	DUDE	Ah fuck it.
L84546	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
L84545	u4057	m269	DUDE	No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
L84544	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	But I do work, so if you don't mind--
L84543	u4057	m269	DUDE	Is this a--what day is this?
L84542	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
L84541	u4057	m269	DUDE	Employed?
L84540	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Are you employed, sir?
L84539	u4057	m269	DUDE	Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
L84538	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
L84537	u4057	m269	DUDE	Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
L84536	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
L84535	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
L84534	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
L84533	u4057	m269	DUDE	You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
L84532	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Did I urinate on your rug?
L84531	u4057	m269	DUDE	So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
L84530	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
L84529	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
L84528	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
L84527	u4057	m269	DUDE	Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
L85381	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
L85380	u4065	m269	WALTER	Shit, sorry man.
L85374	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
L85373	u4065	m269	WALTER	Oh, shit.
L85366	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Stay away from me, mister!
L85365	u4065	m269	WALTER	This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
L85364	u4065	m269	WALTER	Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
L85363	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	I said out.  Now.
L85362	u4065	m269	WALTER	Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
L85354	u4065	m269	WALTER	I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
L85353	u4058	m269	LEBOWSKI	Who the hell is he?
L84615	u4065	m269	WALTER	This is a league game, Smokey!

L84613	u4061	m269	SMOKEY	All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!

L84596	u4065	m269	WALTER	This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.

L91963	u4094	m273	INTERN	Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
L91962	u4090	m273	ANNA	Something was wrong.
L91961	u4094	m273	INTERN	--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
L91960	u4090	m273	ANNA	I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
L91959	u4094	m273	INTERN	Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
L91958	u4090	m273	ANNA	Why?
L92349	u4090	m273	ANNA	--Nick!!
L92348	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
L92339	u4090	m273	ANNA	I haven't killed any--
L92338	u4091	m273	COTTER	--the witch kills children--
L91939	u4091	m273	COTTER	There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
L91938	u4090	m273	ANNA	Looks like business is booming.
L91918	u4091	m273	COTTER	That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
L91917	u4090	m273	ANNA	That's a joke?
L91916	u4091	m273	COTTER	Druid Hill Park.
L91906	u4090	m273	ANNA	We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
L91905	u4091	m273	COTTER	You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
L91904	u4090	m273	ANNA	Oh, sorry, right.
L91903	u4091	m273	COTTER	--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
L91879	u4090	m273	ANNA	Not the only things missing, Nick.
L91878	u4091	m273	COTTER	This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
L91746	u4090	m273	ANNA	So whoever built this--
L91745	u4091	m273	COTTER	Yeah, so?
L91736	u4090	m273	ANNA	No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
L91735	u4091	m273	COTTER	Oak?
L91723	u4090	m273	ANNA	Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
L91722	u4091	m273	COTTER	Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
L91689	u4090	m273	ANNA	The Witch's voice.
L91688	u4091	m273	COTTER	The Voiiiiices made him do it.
L91643	u4091	m273	COTTER	Then there she blows.
L91642	u4090	m273	ANNA	I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
L91641	u4091	m273	COTTER	--how old?
L91638	u4090	m273	ANNA	No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
L91637	u4091	m273	COTTER	What's she look like?
L91634	u4091	m273	COTTER	Who?
L91633	u4090	m273	ANNA	She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
L91632	u4091	m273	COTTER	Why are we here?
L91627	u4091	m273	COTTER	Think again.
L91626	u4090	m273	ANNA	Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
L91625	u4091	m273	COTTER	'Thought those all got stolen.
L91584	u4091	m273	COTTER	--a six week bun in the oven--
L91583	u4090	m273	ANNA	"--it's called ""morning sickness,"" asshole--"
L91582	u4091	m273	COTTER	--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
L91581	u4090	m273	ANNA	--Christ almighty--
L91580	u4091	m273	COTTER	The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
L91576	u4090	m273	ANNA	Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
L91575	u4091	m273	COTTER	"Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the ""feeling."""
L91574	u4091	m273	COTTER	Christ.
L91573	u4090	m273	ANNA	Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
L91572	u4091	m273	COTTER	"Shit? This is from ""Josh's Blair Witch Mix,"" man!"
L92353	u4090	m273	ANNA	--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
L92352	u4096	m273	NICK	Oh, Jesus, no--
L92337	u4090	m273	ANNA	--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
L92336	u4096	m273	NICK	--like you hurt the baby--
L92331	u4096	m273	NICK	I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
L92330	u4090	m273	ANNA	Why?
L92329	u4096	m273	NICK	Are you marked like this??
L92328	u4090	m273	ANNA	--no, what's wrong with you?
L92327	u4096	m273	NICK	The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
L92326	u4090	m273	ANNA	Whatever you want.
L92325	u4096	m273	NICK	I want to see something!
L92168	u4090	m273	ANNA	--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
L92167	u4096	m273	NICK	Then I'm going--
L92166	u4090	m273	ANNA	I can't.
L92165	u4096	m273	NICK	I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
L92012	u4096	m273	NICK	Here.
L92011	u4090	m273	ANNA	Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
L92010	u4096	m273	NICK	What'd you dream?
L92009	u4090	m273	ANNA	I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
L92008	u4096	m273	NICK	Just...try and go back to sleep.
L92007	u4090	m273	ANNA	No.
L92006	u4096	m273	NICK	Just now?
L92005	u4090	m273	ANNA	What?
L92004	u4096	m273	NICK	Was that you laughing?
L92003	u4090	m273	ANNA	I guess, yeah.
L92002	u4096	m273	NICK	--you should get back into bed.
L92001	u4090	m273	ANNA	Nothing. I dunno--
L91978	u4090	m273	ANNA	Sleep.
L91977	u4096	m273	NICK	What can I get you?
L91972	u4090	m273	ANNA	--Cotter's--
L91971	u4096	m273	NICK	We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
L91953	u4090	m273	ANNA	Get your goddamn--
L91952	u4096	m273	NICK	--now c'mon!
L91948	u4096	m273	NICK	--bullshit!
L91947	u4090	m273	ANNA	I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
L91946	u4096	m273	NICK	We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
L91945	u4090	m273	ANNA	For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
L91942	u4090	m273	ANNA	We've looked at half of one tape.
L91941	u4096	m273	NICK	I think we get the gist.
L91902	u4090	m273	ANNA	No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
L91901	u4096	m273	NICK	And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
L91900	u4090	m273	ANNA	I want to see the tapes.
L91899	u4096	m273	NICK	This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
L91845	u4096	m273	NICK	--scared the living shit out of us.
L91844	u4090	m273	ANNA	--or someone--
L91804	u4090	m273	ANNA	Yes.
L91803	u4096	m273	NICK	You want me to scooch over next to you?
L91802	u4090	m273	ANNA	I don't know. Nightmare.
L91801	u4096	m273	NICK	Baby names?
L91800	u4090	m273	ANNA	I don't know.
L91799	u4096	m273	NICK	"You said the name ""James."""
L91798	u4090	m273	ANNA	What?
L91767	u4090	m273	ANNA	--fine, later, fine.
L91766	u4096	m273	NICK	Anna--
L91765	u4090	m273	ANNA	You feel no need to get married or anything.
L91764	u4096	m273	NICK	Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
L91763	u4090	m273	ANNA	"Why is there no ""our"" here?"
L91762	u4096	m273	NICK	Your body, your call.
L91761	u4090	m273	ANNA	You don't want it though.
L91760	u4096	m273	NICK	Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
L91759	u4090	m273	ANNA	Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
L91758	u4096	m273	NICK	Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
L91757	u4090	m273	ANNA	You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
L91756	u4096	m273	NICK	No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
L91755	u4090	m273	ANNA	It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
L91754	u4096	m273	NICK	Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
L91751	u4096	m273	NICK	No--<u>this</u> is weird.
L91750	u4090	m273	ANNA	Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
L91749	u4096	m273	NICK	The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
L91748	u4090	m273	ANNA	--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
L91747	u4096	m273	NICK	--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
L91742	u4096	m273	NICK	Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
L91741	u4090	m273	ANNA	--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
L91740	u4096	m273	NICK	It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
L91739	u4090	m273	ANNA	That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
L91734	u4090	m273	ANNA	What is <u>this</u>?
L91733	u4096	m273	NICK	--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
L91714	u4096	m273	NICK	<u>Yes</u>.
L91713	u4090	m273	ANNA	You sure?
L91712	u4096	m273	NICK	No.
L91701	u4096	m273	NICK	--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
L91700	u4090	m273	ANNA	--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
L91699	u4096	m273	NICK	--<u>myth</u>--
L91651	u4096	m273	NICK	--whatever; that's her.
L91650	u4090	m273	ANNA	No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
L91647	u4096	m273	NICK	That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
L91646	u4090	m273	ANNA	What?
L91645	u4096	m273	NICK	Jesus.
L91640	u4090	m273	ANNA	She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
L91639	u4096	m273	NICK	So says her website.
L91636	u4090	m273	ANNA	Domini. Domini Von Teer.
L91635	u4096	m273	NICK	"Whatzername--the ""psychic"" Anna hired."
L91620	u4090	m273	ANNA	It's like traveling back in time.
L91619	u4096	m273	NICK	Cheery little place.
L92269	u4091	m273	COTTER	I can't let you in.
L92268	u4097	m273	SID	It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
L92267	u4091	m273	COTTER	I can't.
L92266	u4097	m273	SID	Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
L92265	u4091	m273	COTTER	You have to go.
L92264	u4097	m273	SID	I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
L92057	u4097	m273	SID	Looks like a rope.
L92056	u4091	m273	COTTER	The, uh, blur there.
L92055	u4097	m273	SID	You mind me asking: why the fuck?
L92054	u4091	m273	COTTER	Yeah.
L92053	u4097	m273	SID	<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
L92052	u4091	m273	COTTER	--no one'll ever know.
L92051	u4097	m273	SID	--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
L92050	u4091	m273	COTTER	--hours before--

L92048	u4091	m273	COTTER	Absolutely.
L92047	u4097	m273	SID	Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
L92046	u4091	m273	COTTER	I know, I know.
L92045	u4097	m273	SID	You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
L92076	u4092	m273	DOMINI	It's not about witches, goddamnit!
L92075	u4091	m273	COTTER	The witch?
L92064	u4091	m273	COTTER	Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
L92063	u4092	m273	DOMINI	So lemme see it.
L92035	u4091	m273	COTTER	Four in the morning?
L92034	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--go!
L92033	u4091	m273	COTTER	I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
L92032	u4092	m273	DOMINI	If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
L92031	u4091	m273	COTTER	Can't you like just divine it?
L92028	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
L92027	u4091	m273	COTTER	I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
L92026	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
L92025	u4091	m273	COTTER	Okay, a blur.
L92018	u4091	m273	COTTER	Fine.
L92017	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
L92016	u4091	m273	COTTER	There, what? I didn't see anything.
L91993	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
L91992	u4091	m273	COTTER	Does it hurt?
L91987	u4091	m273	COTTER	Fine.
L91986	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Turn the tapes back on.
L91985	u4091	m273	COTTER	This is a little nuts.
L91981	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Something. Someone.
L91980	u4091	m273	COTTER	What? That made her lose the baby?
L91979	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
L91950	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
L91949	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
L91897	u4091	m273	COTTER	Well, please keep me fucking informed!
L91896	u4092	m273	DOMINI	I don't know yet.
L91895	u4091	m273	COTTER	Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
L91894	u4092	m273	DOMINI	I don't think it was them.
L91890	u4092	m273	DOMINI	No.
L91889	u4091	m273	COTTER	My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
L91888	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
L91887	u4091	m273	COTTER	How'd you know they were--
L91883	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--no, I think they're all in there.
L91882	u4091	m273	COTTER	<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
L91874	u4091	m273	COTTER	--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
L91873	u4092	m273	DOMINI	--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
L91683	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Sometimes.
L91682	u4091	m273	COTTER	So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
L91678	u4092	m273	DOMINI	Both. Now.
L91677	u4091	m273	COTTER	Beer and weed is what I've got.
L91676	u4092	m273	DOMINI	I want amphetamines.
L91675	u4091	m273	COTTER	You want a hand?
L92309	u4091	m273	COTTER	Anna's the witch.
L92308	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
L92286	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
L92285	u4091	m273	COTTER	--who?
L92284	u4093	m273	HEATHER	"--it's the ""Blair Witch Cult""--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--"
L92276	u4091	m273	COTTER	--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
L92275	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
L92274	u4091	m273	COTTER	--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
L92260	u4091	m273	COTTER	No one ever comes here.
L92259	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Who?
L92255	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Goes right along with these two.
L92254	u4091	m273	COTTER	"For ""James?"""
L92253	u4093	m273	HEATHER	"That's a ""j."""
L92228	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
L92227	u4091	m273	COTTER	--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
L92226	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Nobody's going anywhere--
L92217	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--before you lose your emotional lunch.
L92216	u4091	m273	COTTER	I'd strongly advise you to join us--
L92201	u4093	m273	HEATHER	<u>What</u>--
L92200	u4091	m273	COTTER	Be it still alive, James?
L92198	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--Domini!
L92197	u4091	m273	COTTER	--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
L92196	u4093	m273	HEATHER	The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
L92195	u4091	m273	COTTER	Yeah. Me too.
L92194	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--I saw what I saw.
L92193	u4091	m273	COTTER	The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
L92192	u4091	m273	COTTER	--I don't know.
L92191	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What the fuck--??
L92190	u4091	m273	COTTER	Next time try putting on shoes--
L92189	u4093	m273	HEATHER	It's <u>freezing</u>.
L92188	u4091	m273	COTTER	--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
L92187	u4093	m273	HEATHER	How's she going to know where to--
L92186	u4091	m273	COTTER	Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
L92184	u4091	m273	COTTER	Down there in the Park.
L92183	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Where?

L92179	u4093	m273	HEATHER	You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
L92178	u4091	m273	COTTER	Fucking owl!
L92177	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Cotter?
L92176	u4091	m273	COTTER	--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--

L92174	u4091	m273	COTTER	--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
L92173	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
L92129	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
L92128	u4091	m273	COTTER	She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
L92126	u4091	m273	COTTER	Don't have one.
L92125	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Fire escape??

L92023	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Still don't see it--
L92022	u4091	m273	COTTER	Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
L91937	u4091	m273	COTTER	I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
L91936	u4093	m273	HEATHER	English.
L91933	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.

L91923	u4091	m273	COTTER	What?
L91922	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--Cotter: shut up.
L91921	u4091	m273	COTTER	Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
L91915	u4091	m273	COTTER	Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
L91914	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What about night?
L91908	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.

L91785	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Try a long walk.
L91784	u4091	m273	COTTER	No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
L91783	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
L91782	u4091	m273	COTTER	No.
L91781	u4093	m273	HEATHER	No fucking.

L91772	u4091	m273	COTTER	So where the hell am I going to sleep?
L91771	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Never would've guessed.
L91770	u4091	m273	COTTER	Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
L91769	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Nice tent.
L91728	u4091	m273	COTTER	Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?

L92231	u4091	m273	COTTER	It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.

L92224	u4091	m273	COTTER	Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?

L92258	u4093	m273	HEATHER	You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
L92257	u4096	m273	NICK	--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
L92256	u4093	m273	HEATHER	"Put 'em together that's a ""k."" James Kurth--"

L92238	u4096	m273	NICK	Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
L92237	u4093	m273	HEATHER	I can't do it!
L92230	u4093	m273	HEATHER	We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
L92229	u4096	m273	NICK	Domini's the only logical explanation.
L92223	u4096	m273	NICK	--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
L92222	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
L92221	u4096	m273	NICK	Domini.
L92220	u4093	m273	HEATHER	We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
L92214	u4096	m273	NICK	Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
L92213	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Spare me.
L92208	u4096	m273	NICK	I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
L92207	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What?
L92164	u4093	m273	HEATHER	That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
L92163	u4096	m273	NICK	There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
L92162	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
L92161	u4096	m273	NICK	You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
L92160	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Shoot.
L92159	u4096	m273	NICK	Okay. Hypothetically.

L92151	u4096	m273	NICK	Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
L92150	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
L92149	u4096	m273	NICK	Finally got her back to sleep.
L91691	u4096	m273	NICK	Whatever.
L91690	u4093	m273	HEATHER	She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
L91623	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
L91622	u4096	m273	NICK	They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
L91621	u4093	m273	HEATHER	The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.

L92144	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
L92143	u4098	m273	WOMAN'S VOICE	--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
L92142	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--the Sheriff's Office--
L92141	u4098	m273	WOMAN'S VOICE	--yes--
L92140	u4093	m273	HEATHER	I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
L92139	u4098	m273	WOMAN'S VOICE	....Ma'am?
L92137	u4093	m273	HEATHER	His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
L92136	u4098	m273	WOMAN'S VOICE	Could I tell him what it's regarding?
L92135	u4093	m273	HEATHER	--it's urgent!
L92134	u4098	m273	WOMAN'S VOICE	He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
L92133	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
L92132	u4098	m273	WOMAN'S VOICE	Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
L92117	u4093	m273	HEATHER	No.
L92116	u4095	m273	MAN'S VOICE	I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
L92115	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Yes.
L92114	u4095	m273	MAN'S VOICE	There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
L92113	u4093	m273	HEATHER	What happened to my Dad??
L92112	u4095	m273	MAN'S VOICE	Your mother's pastor.
L92111	u4093	m273	HEATHER	Who <u>is</u> this??
L92110	u4095	m273	MAN'S VOICE	She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
L109038	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
L109037	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
L109036	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
L109035	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
L109034	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I'm going to Paris.
L109008	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
L109007	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	We don't know what we're into!
L109006	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What do you want to do?
L109005	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Forget it.
L109004	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
L109003	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
L109002	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- if we can get a clean shot --
L109001	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	-- he went inside! --
L108941	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	This doesn't go upstairs.
L108940	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
L108939	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	No.  We can't risk it.
L108915	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
L108914	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
L108913	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
L108778	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	I'm not asking.
L108777	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
L108776	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	I want a second opinion.
L108775	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
L108774	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
L108773	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
L108772	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
L108771	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
L108770	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
L108769	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
L108599	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
L108598	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	And what if I couldn't do that?
L108597	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
L108596	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
L108595	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I thought you were never going to do that.
L108594	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Yes.
L108593	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	You're asking me a direct question?
L108592	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
L108591	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I don't know what we're talking about.
L108590	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
L109103	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Why?
L109102	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...they won't let you go...
L109101	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What do they want me to do?
L109100	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
L109099	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I think so.
L109098	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
L109097	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What is Treadstone?
L109096	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
L109095	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Treadstone.
L109094	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...it's a problem...
L109093	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.
L109092	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
L109091	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Paris.  I live in Paris...
L109090	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...which one are you?...
L109089	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Treadstone?
L109088	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
L109087	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What do you mean?
L109086	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
L109085	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I won't ask again.
L109135	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That'll be their second worst mistake.
L109134	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Jason...  They can't let you go...
L109133	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Keep it. 
L109132	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
L109131	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Jason Bourne is dead.
L109130	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We have to go home, Jason.
L109129	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't think so.
L109128	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
L109127	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That's all I get?
L109126	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	So it's time to go home.
L109125	u4216	m282	BOURNE	So now you know.
L109124	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
L109123	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I know you've been trying to kill me.
L109122	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
L109121	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L109120	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
L109119	u4216	m282	BOURNE	<u>What did you do to me</u>?
L109118	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
L109117	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Are you Treadstone?
L109027	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	Get the kids out!
L109026	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L109025	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
L109023	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
L109022	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Who do you think sent me?
L109015	u4216	m282	BOURNE	It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
L109014	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
L109013	u4216	m282	BOURNE	MPG Capital.
L109012	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
L108637	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yeah, I know...
L108636	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	Sir, you waited on line.
L108635	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, maybe I should just...
L108634	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
L108633	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
L108632	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	You have your passport?
L108631	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Right.
L108630	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	Well, either you are, or you aren't.
L108629	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
L108628	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	You're a U.S. Citizen?
L108827	u4224	m282	OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, sir.
L108826	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
L108825	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
L108824	u4224	m282	OPERATOR/PHONE	-- sir? --
L108823	u4216	m282	BOURNE	D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
L108822	u4224	m282	OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
L108821	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
L108820	u4224	m282	OPERATOR/PHONE	Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
L108819	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Paris?
L108817	u4216	m282	BOURNE	...yes -- oui -- uh...
L108843	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
L108842	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
L108841	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
L108840	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Right.  Yes.  Of course.
L108839	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	His brother.  You know his brother?
L108838	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Who?  Who came?
L108837	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
L108836	u4216	m282	BOURNE	...I understand...
L108835	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
L108834	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
L108833	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.
L108832	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	You are a friend of his?
L108831	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.  Is he there?
L108830	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
L108829	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes, I'm here...
L108828	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
L108958	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That'd be great.
L108957	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
L108956	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I hadn't heard.
L108955	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
L108954	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Excuse me?
L108953	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Was it the break-in?
L108952	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Okay.
L108951	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
L108950	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.
L108949	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
L108948	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
L108947	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Did you?
L108946	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	We thought you were gone for good.
L108945	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Really.
L108944	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
L108943	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Thanks.
L108942	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
L109145	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Not really.
L109144	u4222	m282	MARIE	You have ID?
L109143	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Think I could rent a scooter?
L109142	u4222	m282	MARIE	Yes.
L109141	u4216	m282	BOURNE	This your store?
L109140	u4222	m282	MARIE	Can I help you?
L109114	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.

L109040	u4216	m282	BOURNE	You could do that?
L109039	u4222	m282	MARIE	It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.

L108990	u4222	m282	MARIE	What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
L108989	u4216	m282	BOURNE	It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
L108988	u4222	m282	MARIE	What is that?
L108987	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Nykwana Wombosi. 
L108986	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
L108960	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
L108959	u4222	m282	MARIE	I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
L108919	u4222	m282	MARIE	It's a company... MPG Capital.
L108918	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Who paid the bill?
L108917	u4222	m282	MARIE	You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
L108893	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
L108892	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- we'll tell them what happened --

L108887	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- there's no time --
L108886	u4222	m282	MARIE	But the police --

L108884	u4222	m282	MARIE	Oh, Jesus...
L108883	u4216	m282	BOURNE	And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
L108882	u4222	m282	MARIE	He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
L108881	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I didn't know this would happen.
L108880	u4222	m282	MARIE	I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
L108879	u4216	m282	BOURNE	You're wrong.  I didn't know.
L108878	u4222	m282	MARIE	I trusted you.
L108877	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.
L108876	u4222	m282	MARIE	You knew he was coming.
L108875	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
L108874	u4222	m282	MARIE	He came to kill us.
L108873	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
L108872	u4222	m282	MARIE	He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
L108871	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
L108870	u4222	m282	MARIE	He's dead isn't he?

L108864	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
L108863	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
L108862	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
L108861	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- just --
L108860	u4222	m282	MARIE	...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
L108859	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
L108858	u4222	m282	MARIE	...omigod, no...
L108857	u4216	m282	BOURNE	WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
L108854	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
L108853	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
L108850	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
L108849	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
L108848	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
L108814	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Go ahead.
L108813	u4222	m282	MARIE	See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
L108812	u4216	m282	BOURNE	All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
L108811	u4222	m282	MARIE	This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
L108809	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I guess so.
L108808	u4222	m282	MARIE	This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
L108799	u4216	m282	BOURNE	How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
L108798	u4222	m282	MARIE	Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
L108797	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
L108796	u4222	m282	MARIE	You got me pretty fucking curious.
L108795	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, I don't know what's up there.
L108794	u4222	m282	MARIE	Anytime.
L108793	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Thanks for the ride.
L108792	u4222	m282	MARIE	Okay, so...
L108790	u4222	m282	MARIE	Jason...
L108789	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't remember any of this.
L108788	u4222	m282	MARIE	I should go.
L108787	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I guess.
L108786	u4222	m282	MARIE	So this is it, right?
L108785	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
L108784	u4222	m282	MARIE	Where?
L108783	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
L108782	u4222	m282	MARIE	Looks familiar?
L108781	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Four-fifty.  That's the address...
L108780	u4222	m282	MARIE	That's it?  Is that it?
L108779	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
L108764	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I thought about it.  I don't know.
L108763	u4222	m282	MARIE	You ever think maybe you have a family?
L108762	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
L108761	u4222	m282	MARIE	You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
L108760	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I can't believe I slept.
L108759	u4222	m282	MARIE	We're about an hour away.
L108758	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Where are we?
L108757	u4222	m282	MARIE	I needed a break.
L108742	u4222	m282	MARIE	You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
L108741	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
L108740	u4222	m282	MARIE	People do amazing things when they're scared.
L108739	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
L108738	u4222	m282	MARIE	Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
L108737	u4216	m282	BOURNE	There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
L108736	u4222	m282	MARIE	Okay, so you're a victim.
L108735	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I was shot twice in the back.
L108734	u4222	m282	MARIE	Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
L108733	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L108732	u4222	m282	MARIE	What are you talking about?
L108731	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
L108730	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- you could put it together --
L108729	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
L108728	u4222	m282	MARIE	Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
L108727	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Nothing.  It's just not there.
L108726	u4222	m282	MARIE	When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
L108725	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.
L108724	u4222	m282	MARIE	And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
L108718	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That's what I'm saying.
L108717	u4222	m282	MARIE	Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
L108716	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
L108715	u4222	m282	MARIE	What?  Like amnesia?
L108714	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
L108713	u4222	m282	MARIE	Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
L108712	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
L108711	u4222	m282	MARIE	Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
L108710	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Listen to what you want.
L108709	u4222	m282	MARIE	What does that mean?
L108708	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L108707	u4222	m282	MARIE	I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
L108706	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
L108705	u4222	m282	MARIE	Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
L108704	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I know that.
L108703	u4222	m282	MARIE	Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
L108701	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Then I'll find another ride.
L108700	u4222	m282	MARIE	What if I say no?
L108699	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I won't hurt you.
L108698	u4222	m282	MARIE	And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
L108697	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
L108696	u4222	m282	MARIE	You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
L108695	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
L108694	u4222	m282	MARIE	You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
L108693	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
L108692	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
L108691	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Wait up --  -- just wait up --
L108690	u4222	m282	MARIE	<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
L108689	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
L108688	u4222	m282	MARIE	You have blood on your pants.
L108687	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I said ten thousand.
L108686	u4222	m282	MARIE	For twenty thousand dollars.
L108685	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I want to go home.
L108684	u4222	m282	MARIE	So what's in Paris?
L108670	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
L108669	u4222	m282	MARIE	Jesus...
L108668	u4216	m282	BOURNE	You don't want the police any more than I do.
L108667	u4222	m282	MARIE	Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
L108666	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
L108665	u4222	m282	MARIE	Get the fuck away from my car.
L108664	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I've got a situation here and --
L108663	u4222	m282	MARIE	It's a little late for that.
L108662	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Please.  I don't want to scare you.
L108661	u4222	m282	MARIE	Oh, Jesus...

L108976	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
L108975	u4223	m282	MORGUE BOSS	So get the hell out of here.
L108974	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Shit, we didn't sign in.
L108973	u4223	m282	MORGUE BOSS	I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
L108972	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Where did this body go?

L109053	u4217	m282	CLERK	What?
L109052	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Get in the basement.
L109051	u4217	m282	CLERK	That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
L109050	u4216	m282	BOURNE	He run away often?

L108615	u4222	m282	MARIE	All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
L108614	u4217	m282	CLERK	Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
L108937	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
L108936	u4227	m282	RESEARCH TECH #1	-- I'm on it --
L108935	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- let's check that Interpol window again --
L108755	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Enhance it.
L108754	u4227	m282	RESEARCH TECH #1	It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
L108753	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What's that?
L108752	u4227	m282	RESEARCH TECH #1	Sir...
L108748	u4227	m282	RESEARCH TECH #1	Hang on... 
L108747	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
L108746	u4227	m282	RESEARCH TECH #1	That's the only angle.
L108745	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
L108751	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	That'll solve all our problems.
L108750	u4232	m282	ZORN	Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
L108749	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What?
L108681	u4232	m282	ZORN	All of them?
L108680	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
L108679	u4232	m282	ZORN	Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
L108678	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What the fuck is he doing?
L108677	u4232	m282	ZORN	Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
L108676	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What?
L108626	u4232	m282	ZORN	-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
L108625	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- but it was <u>him</u> --
L108624	u4232	m282	ZORN	-- he accessed the account --
L108623	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- and they're sure it's him? --
L108589	u4232	m282	ZORN	I tried.
L108588	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Tell him we're busy.
L108587	u4232	m282	ZORN	Abbott wants to talk.
L108586	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What?
L108650	u4228	m282	SECURITY CHIEF	-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
L108649	u4219	m282	DEPUTY DCM	-- you gotta give me more to go on --
L108648	u4228	m282	SECURITY CHIEF	-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
L108647	u4219	m282	DEPUTY DCM	-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
L108646	u4228	m282	SECURITY CHIEF	-- we're evacuating the building --
L108645	u4219	m282	DEPUTY DCM	-- what're you talking about? --
L108569	u4229	m282	THE MAN	I won't forget this.
L108568	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
L108565	u4229	m282	THE MAN	I don't know.
L108564	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	You drink rum?
L108563	u4229	m282	THE MAN	I don't remember Zurich.
L108562	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
L108561	u4229	m282	THE MAN	No.
L108560	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
L108557	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	I told you.  You need to rest.
L108556	u4229	m282	THE MAN	What if it doesn't come back?
L108554	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
L108553	u4229	m282	THE MAN	How did I get here?
L108552	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
L108551	u4229	m282	THE MAN	<u>Where am I</u>?
L108550	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
L108549	u4229	m282	THE MAN	Where am I?
L108548	u4220	m282	GIANCARLO	You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
L126767	u4425	m293	TEX	First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
L126766	u4411	m293	ADAM	What are you talking about?
L126765	u4425	m293	TEX	You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
L126764	u4411	m293	ADAM	You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
L126763	u4425	m293	TEX	The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
L126762	u4411	m293	ADAM	All right -- where's the letter?
L126690	u4425	m293	TEX	 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
L126689	u4411	m293	ADAM	Where are you, ol' buddy?
L126688	u4425	m293	TEX	Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
L126934	u4411	m293	ADAM	What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
L126933	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
L126932	u4411	m293	ADAM	Reggie -- listen to me --
L126931	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Then say it.
L126930	u4411	m293	ADAM	I heard you, I heard you.
L126929	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I said, tell me to go to the --
L126928	u4421	m293	REGGIE	All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
L126927	u4411	m293	ADAM	What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
L126926	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
L126925	u4411	m293	ADAM	And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
L126924	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
L126922	u4411	m293	ADAM	Here, give it to me.
L126921	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You didn't have to chase me so hard --
L126900	u4411	m293	ADAM	There's not a reason on earth why you should.
L126899	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
L126898	u4411	m293	ADAM	Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
L126897	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You lied to me so many times --
L126896	u4411	m293	ADAM	Reggie -- listen to me!
L126893	u4411	m293	ADAM	Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
L126892	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
L126881	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No!
L126880	u4411	m293	ADAM	Reggie -- please believe me!
L126879	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Then who did? You're the only one left.
L126878	u4411	m293	ADAM	But I didn't kill anybody.
L126877	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm through listening to you!
L126876	u4411	m293	ADAM	Reggie -- why won't you listen?
L126848	u4411	m293	ADAM	Don't be an idiot!
L126847	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
L126846	u4411	m293	ADAM	I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
L126845	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
L126844	u4411	m293	ADAM	Reggie -- stop!
L126756	u4411	m293	ADAM	Look.
L126755	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Tex? You mean he's here, too?
L126754	u4411	m293	ADAM	It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
L126753	u4421	m293	REGGIE	It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
L126752	u4411	m293	ADAM	Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
L126751	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
L126750	u4411	m293	ADAM	I know, but this is all we've got left.
L126749	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
L126748	u4411	m293	ADAM	Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
L126747	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Now what?
L126746	u4411	m293	ADAM	It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
L126745	u4421	m293	REGGIE	as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lyses! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
L126742	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
L126741	u4411	m293	ADAM	There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
L126740	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Of course there is!
L126739	u4411	m293	ADAM	Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
L126738	u4421	m293	REGGIE	That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
L126737	u4411	m293	ADAM	Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
L126736	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I think it only said where -- but I can't --
L126735	u4411	m293	ADAM	With whom? Where?
L126734	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
L126733	u4411	m293	ADAM	Can you remember anything at all?
L126732	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
L126729	u4411	m293	ADAM	Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
L126728	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
L126727	u4411	m293	ADAM	Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
L126720	u4421	m293	REGGIE	"No -- last time I said ""I love you, Alex."""
L126719	u4411	m293	ADAM	Yes, you told me.
L126718	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I love you, Adam.
L126717	u4411	m293	ADAM	Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
L126716	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
L126715	u4411	m293	ADAM	Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
L126714	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
L126713	u4411	m293	ADAM	It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
L126710	u4411	m293	ADAM	The letter --
L126709	u4421	m293	REGGIE	To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
L126708	u4411	m293	ADAM	Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
L126704	u4411	m293	ADAM	I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
L126703	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Lord, you're stubborn.
L126702	u4411	m293	ADAM	Let's look anyway.
L126701	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
L126699	u4411	m293	ADAM	I sure am. Get it.
L126698	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Lord, you're stubborn.
L126697	u4411	m293	ADAM	Where's that airlines bag?
L126696	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
L126695	u4411	m293	ADAM	I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
L126694	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Why?
L126693	u4411	m293	ADAM	I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
L126692	u4411	m293	ADAM	Open up.
L126691	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What is it?
L126686	u4411	m293	ADAM	There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
L126685	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Adam --
L126684	u4411	m293	ADAM	If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
L126683	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You're going to look for him -- now?
L126682	u4411	m293	ADAM	That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
L126666	u4411	m293	ADAM	Relax -- you're gaining.
L126665	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
L126664	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well -- come on.
L126663	u4411	m293	ADAM	When you come on, you really come on.
L126662	u4411	m293	ADAM	No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
L126661	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
L126660	u4411	m293	ADAM	How do you think I got here?
L126659	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
L126658	u4411	m293	ADAM	Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
L126657	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
L126656	u4411	m293	ADAM	Why do you think I brought you here?
L126655	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You don't look so bad in this light.
L126654	u4411	m293	ADAM	It's all right -- look.
L126653	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Adam!
L126652	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
L126651	u4411	m293	ADAM	What's the matter?
L126650	u4411	m293	ADAM	It's lovely.
L126649	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What about it?
L126648	u4411	m293	ADAM	Oh, you should see your face.
L126647	u4411	m293	ADAM	Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
L126646	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What?
L126645	u4411	m293	ADAM	It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
L126644	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No -- I guess not.
L126643	u4411	m293	ADAM	What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
L126642	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh!
L126641	u4411	m293	ADAM	That's right.
L126640	u4421	m293	REGGIE	All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
L126639	u4411	m293	ADAM	How was I leading you on?
L126638	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
L126637	u4411	m293	ADAM	I think that's what you ordered.
L126636	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I could eat a horse.
L126633	u4411	m293	ADAM	Yes, but --
L126632	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
L126631	u4411	m293	ADAM	It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
L126630	u4421	m293	REGGIE	-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
L126629	u4411	m293	ADAM	Oh, come on!
L126839	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
L126838	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
L126837	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
L126836	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
L126835	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
L126834	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
L126591	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
L126590	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Are you sure there's no mistake?
L126589	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
L126588	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
L126587	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
L126586	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes -- ?
L126285	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Agents.
L126284	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
L126283	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Me? Why me?
L126282	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
L126281	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh. Then who's this one?
L126280	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
L126279	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But no one actually saw him die.
L126278	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	No, Mrs. Lampert.
L126277	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
L126276	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
L126275	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
L126274	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	That's the spirit.
L126273	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
L126272	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
L126271	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
L126270	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
L126269	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
L126268	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
L126267	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
L126266	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
L126263	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
L126262	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
L126261	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
L126256	u4421	m293	REGGIE	May I have a cigarette, please?
L126255	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
L126254	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Steal it how?
L126253	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
L126252	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
L126250	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Can I at least keep the onion soup?
L126249	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
L126248	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
L126247	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Caf.
L126244	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
L126243	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Barely, yes.
L126242	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
L126241	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
L126240	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
L126239	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
L126236	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
L126235	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
L126234	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Carson?
L126233	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	That's not Carson Dyle.
L126232	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, what?
L126231	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	No.
L126230	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
L126229	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Describe him.
L126228	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
L126227	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
L126226	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Dyle, or whatever his name is.
L126225	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Who?
L126224	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
L126223	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Agents.
L126222	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
L126221	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Were you followed?
L126220	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
L126206	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
L126205	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
L126204	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
L126203	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
L126014	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
L126013	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh.
L126012	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Because they're still here.
L126011	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Why not?
L126010	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
L126009	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
L126008	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
L126007	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
L126006	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
L126005	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But --
L126004	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
L126003	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
L126002	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
L126001	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
L126000	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
L125999	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Thanks very much.
L125998	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I believe you.
L125997	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
L125996	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
L125995	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But I don't have it.
L125994	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	And I'm afraid we want it back.
L125993	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh, I see.
L125992	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Ours.
L125991	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Then whose is it? His or theirs?
L125990	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
L125989	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
L125988	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
L125987	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
L125986	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
L125985	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
L125984	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
L125983	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
L125982	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
L125966	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
L125965	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
L125964	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
L125963	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Very sweet.
L125962	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
L125961	u4421	m293	REGGIE	His -- real -- ?
L125960	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
L125959	u4421	m293	REGGIE	So that was it.
L125958	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
L125957	u4421	m293	REGGIE	May I have a sandwich, please?
L125956	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
L125955	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
L125954	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
L125953	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Agent.
L125952	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
L125951	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
L125950	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
L125949	u4421	m293	REGGIE	We? You mean you're --?
L125948	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Only we call them agents.
L125947	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You mean spies and things like that?
L125946	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
L125945	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
L125944	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
L125943	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No thanks.
L125942	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
L125940	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
L125939	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
L125938	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
L125936	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
L125935	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
L125934	u4412	m293	BARTHOLOMEW	I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
L125981	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	No, thank heaven.
L125980	u4413	m293	BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
L125979	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
L125978	u4413	m293	BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	The last one, please.
L125977	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	No.
L125976	u4413	m293	BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
L125975	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
L125974	u4413	m293	BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Next, please.
L125973	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	No.
L125972	u4413	m293	BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
L125971	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
L125970	u4413	m293	BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	1944. The next face, please.
L125969	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	He looks so young -- when was this taken?
L125968	u4413	m293	BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Very good.
L125967	u4422	m293	REGGIE'S VOICE	It's Charles!
L126978	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
L126977	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
L126976	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
L126975	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
L126974	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
L126973	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You'd lie about anything.
L126972	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
L126971	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
L126970	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
L126969	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
L126968	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
L126967	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh.
L126966	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	No.
L126965	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But you're -- divorced?
L126964	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Yes.
L126963	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
L126962	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
L126961	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
L126960	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Brian.
L126959	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What's your first name today?
L126958	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
L126957	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Starting with his own.
L126956	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
L126955	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Bartholomew?
L126954	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
L126953	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Then how do I know this is your office?
L126952	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
L126951	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Around one.
L126950	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
L126949	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
L126948	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
L126947	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
L126946	u4414	m293	CRUIKSHANK	Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
L126945	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
L126452	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	I'll take that.
L126451	u4415	m293	DYLE	We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
L126450	u4415	m293	DYLE	What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
L126449	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Not my room!
L126446	u4415	m293	DYLE	It's all right with us --
L126445	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
L126442	u4415	m293	DYLE	But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
L126441	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
L126438	u4415	m293	DYLE	Or you --  Or you --
L126437	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Me?
L126436	u4415	m293	DYLE	I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
L126435	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Then who does?
L126434	u4415	m293	DYLE	And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
L126336	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	That's the idea.
L126335	u4415	m293	DYLE	Back where?
L126333	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	You're out, Dyle -- right now!
L126332	u4415	m293	DYLE	Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
L126331	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
L126330	u4415	m293	DYLE	Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
L126329	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
L126328	u4415	m293	DYLE	Very pretty. Now what?
L126327	u4415	m293	DYLE	The view had better be worth it.
L126326	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Keep going.
L126325	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Open it.
L126324	u4415	m293	DYLE	Do I knock or something?
L126323	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Okay -- up there.
L126322	u4415	m293	DYLE	Sorry about that.
L126321	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	I said with the mouth shut.
L126320	u4415	m293	DYLE	How long do you intend -- ?
L126319	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	We wait -- with our mouths shut.
L126318	u4415	m293	DYLE	What now?
L126314	u4415	m293	DYLE	You'll wreck your raincoat.
L126313	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
L126628	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
L126627	u4415	m293	DYLE	The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
L126626	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
L126625	u4415	m293	DYLE	Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
L126624	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
L126623	u4415	m293	DYLE	Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
L126622	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't believe it.
L126621	u4415	m293	DYLE	Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
L126620	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You mean, you're a thief?
L126619	u4415	m293	DYLE	When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
L126618	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What do you mean?
L126617	u4415	m293	DYLE	It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
L126616	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
L126615	u4415	m293	DYLE	After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
L126614	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Go on.
L126613	u4415	m293	DYLE	Are you going to listen?
L126612	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well!
L126611	u4415	m293	DYLE	Why don't you shut up!
L126610	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Fiction or non-fiction?
L126609	u4415	m293	DYLE	Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
L126608	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
L126607	u4415	m293	DYLE	I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
L126606	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
L126605	u4415	m293	DYLE	I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
L126604	u4421	m293	REGGIE	It's a start, anyway.
L126603	u4415	m293	DYLE	What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
L126602	u4415	m293	DYLE	Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
L126601	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
L126600	u4415	m293	DYLE	No -- not yet.
L126599	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
L126598	u4415	m293	DYLE	Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
L126597	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
L126596	u4415	m293	DYLE	Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
L126583	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't believe it.
L126582	u4415	m293	DYLE	Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
L126581	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How often do you go through this little ritual?
L126580	u4415	m293	DYLE	The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
L126577	u4415	m293	DYLE	I don't think I know that one.
L126576	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Shut the door!
L126575	u4415	m293	DYLE	I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
L126574	u4415	m293	DYLE	Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
L126573	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What are you doing?
L126572	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I dare you.
L126571	u4415	m293	DYLE	Then I suggest you call one of them.
L126570	u4421	m293	REGGIE	This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
L126569	u4415	m293	DYLE	Reggie -- open the door.
L126568	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The shower's in there.
L126567	u4415	m293	DYLE	Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
L126566	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Got you.
L126555	u4415	m293	DYLE	Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
L126554	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
L126552	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No --
L126551	u4415	m293	DYLE	What? Assassinate somebody?
L126550	u4421	m293	REGGIE	First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
L126549	u4415	m293	DYLE	Yes, I know.
L126548	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
L126547	u4415	m293	DYLE	Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
L126546	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
L126545	u4415	m293	DYLE	Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
L126544	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm scared.
L126543	u4415	m293	DYLE	Hm?
L126542	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Alex --
L126541	u4415	m293	DYLE	No sense messing up the streets.
L126540	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm sorry.
L126539	u4415	m293	DYLE	I'd love some, thanks.
L126538	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
L126537	u4415	m293	DYLE	What -- like Scobie?
L126536	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
L126535	u4415	m293	DYLE	Who?
L126534	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
L126533	u4415	m293	DYLE	A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
L126532	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What's so illogical about that?
L126531	u4415	m293	DYLE	Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
L126530	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
L126529	u4415	m293	DYLE	Why?
L126528	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I think Tex did it.
L126526	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
L126525	u4415	m293	DYLE	Maybe.
L126524	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Or Tex?
L126523	u4415	m293	DYLE	Maybe.
L126522	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
L126495	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No.
L126494	u4415	m293	DYLE	Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
L126457	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
L126456	u4415	m293	DYLE	He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
L126455	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
L126454	u4415	m293	DYLE	Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
L126427	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
L126426	u4415	m293	DYLE	Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
L126415	u4415	m293	DYLE	I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
L126414	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
L126413	u4415	m293	DYLE	Tuesday.
L126412	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What day is it?
L126410	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'll be right there.
L126409	u4415	m293	DYLE	That sounds like their problem.
L126408	u4421	m293	REGGIE	They've got Jean-Louis!
L126403	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
L126402	u4415	m293	DYLE	The phone's ringing --
L126401	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I think I love you, Alex --
L126400	u4415	m293	DYLE	Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
L126399	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh. 
L126398	u4415	m293	DYLE	But I'm not through complaining yet.
L126397	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You did.
L126396	u4415	m293	DYLE	Who told you to do that?
L126395	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Cutting it out.
L126394	u4415	m293	DYLE	What are you doing?
L126393	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Okay.
L126392	u4415	m293	DYLE	Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
L126391	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
L126390	u4415	m293	DYLE	Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
L126389	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Said what?
L126388	u4415	m293	DYLE	There, you said it.
L126387	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Why can't you be serious?
L126386	u4415	m293	DYLE	Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
L126385	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm not fifteen.
L126384	u4415	m293	DYLE	So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
L126383	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
L126382	u4415	m293	DYLE	Reggie -- listen to me --
L126381	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
L126379	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Come here.
L126378	u4415	m293	DYLE	Whitefoot, of course.
L126377	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Which one are you?
L126376	u4415	m293	DYLE	Why not a lying Blackfoot?
L126375	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
L126374	u4415	m293	DYLE	Because he's wearing moccasins.
L126373	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
L126372	u4415	m293	DYLE	There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
L126371	u4421	m293	REGGIE	There must be some way.
L126370	u4415	m293	DYLE	You can't.
L126369	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
L126368	u4415	m293	DYLE	I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
L126367	u4421	m293	REGGIE	There -- you're a new man.
L126366	u4415	m293	DYLE	I'm no easier to live with than he was.
L126365	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I thought that was Peter Joshua.
L126364	u4415	m293	DYLE	Yes, but we're divorced.
L126363	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
L126362	u4415	m293	DYLE	Alexander.
L126361	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
L126360	u4415	m293	DYLE	Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
L126359	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Sure.
L126358	u4415	m293	DYLE	Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
L126357	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
L126356	u4415	m293	DYLE	Would you like to see my passport?
L126355	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
L126354	u4415	m293	DYLE	Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
L126353	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Does it hurt?
L126352	u4421	m293	REGGIE	It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
L126351	u4415	m293	DYLE	Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
L126349	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
L126348	u4415	m293	DYLE	I left him hanging around the American Express.
L126347	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Scobie?
L126346	u4415	m293	DYLE	I met a man with sharp nails.
L126345	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
L126312	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
L126311	u4415	m293	DYLE	The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
L126310	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Your --
L126309	u4415	m293	DYLE	Yes, he is. He was my brother.
L126308	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Carson Dyle is dead.
L126307	u4415	m293	DYLE	But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
L126306	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
L126305	u4415	m293	DYLE	I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
L126304	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Why you lied to me.
L126303	u4415	m293	DYLE	No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
L126302	u4421	m293	REGGIE	It's the only name I've got. How about you?
L126301	u4415	m293	DYLE	Reggie?
L126300	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
L126830	u4416	m293	FLIX	No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
L126829	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm -- I'm sorry.
L126828	u4416	m293	FLIX	I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
L126827	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Please keep it.
L126826	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Here's ten.
L126825	u4416	m293	FLIX	Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
L126824	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
L126823	u4416	m293	FLIX	The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
L126822	u4421	m293	REGGIE	And the last one?
L126821	u4416	m293	FLIX	A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
L126820	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
L126819	u4416	m293	FLIX	Forty-five thousand.
L126818	u4421	m293	REGGIE	In money.
L126817	u4416	m293	FLIX	In human life? In greed? In suffering?
L126816	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What's its value today?
L126815	u4416	m293	FLIX	It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
L126814	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
L126813	u4416	m293	FLIX	In your money, perhaps $65,000.
L126812	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm afraid it is important.
L126811	u4416	m293	FLIX	The money is unimportant.
L126810	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How much is it worth?
L126809	u4416	m293	FLIX	I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
L126808	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
L126807	u4416	m293	FLIX	Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
L126805	u4416	m293	FLIX	The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
L126804	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes.
L126803	u4416	m293	FLIX	I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
L126802	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Monsieur Flix -- ?
L126497	u4425	m293	TEX	The kid said --
L126496	u4417	m293	GIDEON	What do you mean, no?
L126478	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
L126477	u4425	m293	TEX	Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
L126476	u4417	m293	GIDEON	You know I'd tell you if I had it.
L126475	u4425	m293	TEX	You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
L126474	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Meaning what?
L126473	u4425	m293	TEX	You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
L126472	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Not unless we're blind.
L126471	u4425	m293	TEX	There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
L126470	u4417	m293	GIDEON	No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
L126469	u4425	m293	TEX	You sure nuthin's missin'?
L126468	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Why bother him?
L126467	u4425	m293	TEX	And if it is?
L126466	u4417	m293	GIDEON	What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
L126148	u4425	m293	TEX	That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
L126147	u4417	m293	GIDEON	I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
L126131	u4425	m293	TEX	And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
L126130	u4417	m293	GIDEON	That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
L126430	u4417	m293	GIDEON	She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
L126429	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But his mother --
L126428	u4417	m293	GIDEON	I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
L126055	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Stop it!
L126054	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
L126053	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Leave me alone -- !
L126052	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
L126051	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know anything.
L126050	u4417	m293	GIDEON	It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
L126049	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Tell me what?
L126048	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
L126047	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What do you want?
L126046	u4417	m293	GIDEON	Mrs. Lampert --
L126680	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
L126679	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No -- in my room.
L126678	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	In Mr. Dyle's room?
L126677	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I was, too.
L125880	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	And this? And this?
L125879	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't understand.
L125878	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	And this?
L125877	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Of course it is.
L125876	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
L125875	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Is that all? Can I go now?
L125874	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
L125873	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
L125872	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Did you?
L125871	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
L125870	u4421	m293	REGGIE	My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed.  Not very much, is it?
L125869	u4421	m293	REGGIE	A letter? May I see it?
L125868	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
L125867	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
L125866	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	"One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  ""Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elyses""  Why there?"
L125862	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I wish you wouldn't.
L125861	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	Is it all right?
L125860	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	It is all right.
L125859	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I know.  I'm sorry.
L125858	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
L125857	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know.
L125856	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
L125855	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know.
L125854	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	Where did he keep his money?
L125853	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know.
L125852	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	About how wealthy would you say?
L125851	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know. I suppose so.
L125850	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	He was a wealthy man?
L125849	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He didn't have one.
L125848	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	Oh. Swiss. His profession?
L125847	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Swiss.
L125846	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	He was American?
L125845	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm very confused.
L125844	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
L125843	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Leave?
L125842	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
L125841	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm very cold.
L125840	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	You loved him?
L125837	u4418	m293	GRANDPIERRE	I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
L125836	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes.
L126795	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	No -- but I will ask.
L126794	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
L126793	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	But he is gone.
L126789	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
L126788	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
L126787	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
L126499	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, Jean-Louis.
L126498	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	Up there! It is up there!
L126491	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	We won! We won!
L126490	u4421	m293	REGGIE	If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
L126489	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	I found it! I found it!
L126488	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
L126486	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	Up there! I would put it up there!
L126485	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Voil? what?
L126484	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil?!
L126483	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
L126482	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	I know. I would bury it in the garden.
L126481	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
L126459	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What should we give him?
L126458	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
L125830	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	Okay.
L125829	u4421	m293	REGGIE	-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
L125828	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
L125763	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
L125762	u4419	m293	JEAN-LOUIS	Oh, la.
L126200	u4420	m293	PETER	Good night.
L126199	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
L126198	u4420	m293	PETER	Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
L126197	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Don't put yourself out.
L126196	u4420	m293	PETER	Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
L126195	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Words can hurt very much.
L126194	u4420	m293	PETER	You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
L126193	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What are you talking about?
L126192	u4420	m293	PETER	I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
L126191	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How do you know what they're doing?
L126190	u4420	m293	PETER	They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
L126189	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I believe what he said.
L126188	u4420	m293	PETER	I wouldn't take that too seriously.
L126187	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
L126186	u4420	m293	PETER	What'd he say?
L126184	u4420	m293	PETER	What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
L126183	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes -- that's right.
L126179	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The man you had the fight with.
L126178	u4420	m293	PETER	Who is it?
L126174	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Do you tell lies?
L126173	u4420	m293	PETER	Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
L126172	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
L126171	u4420	m293	PETER	That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
L126170	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
L126169	u4420	m293	PETER	Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
L126168	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
L126167	u4420	m293	PETER	No, they won't -- I won't let them.
L126166	u4421	m293	REGGIE	But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
L126165	u4420	m293	PETER	So they think he left it with you.
L126164	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
L126163	u4420	m293	PETER	No, it isn't -- where's the money?
L126162	u4421	m293	REGGIE	That's all.
L126161	u4420	m293	PETER	Go on.
L126160	u4421	m293	REGGIE	A quarter of a million dollars.
L126159	u4420	m293	PETER	What?
L126158	u4421	m293	REGGIE	There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
L126157	u4420	m293	PETER	There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
L126125	u4420	m293	PETER	You took the words right out of my mouth.
L126124	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Be careful, Peter.
L126123	u4420	m293	PETER	Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
L126122	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
L126121	u4420	m293	PETER	I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
L126120	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Peter -- are you all right?
L126113	u4420	m293	PETER	Good night.
L126112	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Nothing. Good night.
L126111	u4420	m293	PETER	What?
L126110	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Do you know what's wrong with you?
L126109	u4420	m293	PETER	Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
L126108	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
L126107	u4420	m293	PETER	How would you like a spanking?
L126106	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
L126104	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How about once more around the park?
L126103	u4420	m293	PETER	On the street where you live.
L126102	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Where?
L126101	u4420	m293	PETER	We're here.
L126100	u4420	m293	PETER	Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
L126099	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
L126098	u4420	m293	PETER	What your husband was mixed up in.
L126097	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What was what?
L126096	u4420	m293	PETER	What was it?
L126095	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How do you shave in there?
L126094	u4420	m293	PETER	You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
L126087	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
L126086	u4420	m293	PETER	I wasn't --
L126085	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
L126084	u4420	m293	PETER	Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
L126083	u4421	m293	REGGIE	That's what I'm not supposed to say.
L126082	u4420	m293	PETER	Who said?
L126081	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
L126080	u4420	m293	PETER	I don't think I follow you.
L126079	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
L126078	u4420	m293	PETER	You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
L126077	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Having a nervous breakdown.
L126076	u4420	m293	PETER	What are you doing in here?
L126045	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Lay on, MacDuff.
L126044	u4420	m293	PETER	En garde.
L126042	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
L126041	u4420	m293	PETER	You mean you and me?
L126040	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
L126039	u4420	m293	PETER	What was all that?
L126037	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Starting tonight?
L126036	u4420	m293	PETER	Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
L126033	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
L126032	u4420	m293	PETER	Of course? I thought he was dead.
L126022	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The man and the woman are married --
L126021	u4420	m293	PETER	I'm still having trouble with English.
L126020	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Don't you understand French?
L126019	u4420	m293	PETER	What's going on?
L126018	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
L126017	u4420	m293	PETER	You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
L126016	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Hallo, Peter.
L125903	u4420	m293	PETER	Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
L125902	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
L125901	u4420	m293	PETER	We'll find you a hotel.
L125900	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know where to go.
L125899	u4420	m293	PETER	Come on. You can't stay here.
L125898	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
L125897	u4420	m293	PETER	Instant divorce you mean?
L125896	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
L125895	u4420	m293	PETER	Doing what?
L125894	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
L125893	u4420	m293	PETER	Do you know what you're going to do?
L125892	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Charles sold it all -- at auction.
L125891	u4420	m293	PETER	Where did everything go?
L125889	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
L125888	u4420	m293	PETER	I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
L125887	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Thank you.
L125886	u4420	m293	PETER	It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
L125885	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How did you find out?
L125884	u4420	m293	PETER	I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
L125883	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What are you doing here?
L125822	u4420	m293	PETER	Is there only one Charles Lampert?
L125821	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Charles is.
L125820	u4420	m293	PETER	Are you in the book?
L125819	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
L125818	u4420	m293	PETER	It's terrible -- you just made it up.
L125817	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How do you know?
L125816	u4420	m293	PETER	Shakespeare never said that.
L125815	u4421	m293	REGGIE	"Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: ""When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again""?"
L125814	u4420	m293	PETER	No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
L125813	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Now you're angry.
L125812	u4420	m293	PETER	Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
L125811	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
L125810	u4420	m293	PETER	Is your husband with you?
L125809	u4421	m293	REGGIE	That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
L125808	u4420	m293	PETER	Yes, but we're divorced.
L125807	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
L125806	u4420	m293	PETER	Oh. I guess.
L125805	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
L125804	u4420	m293	PETER	I'm not sure I --
L125803	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
L125802	u4420	m293	PETER	Well, you're honest, anyway.
L125801	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, you see, I don't really love him.
L125800	u4420	m293	PETER	Please, not on my account.
L125799	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
L125798	u4420	m293	PETER	Good for you.
L125797	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes.
L125796	u4420	m293	PETER	Is there a Mr. Lampert?
L125795	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm Regina Lampert.
L125794	u4420	m293	PETER	Peter Joshua.
L125793	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
L125792	u4420	m293	PETER	Sorry. Which view would you like?
L125791	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
L125790	u4420	m293	PETER	Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
L125788	u4421	m293	REGGIE	You give up awfully easy, don't you?
L125787	u4420	m293	PETER	How's that?
L125786	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Quitter.
L125785	u4420	m293	PETER	Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
L125784	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
L125783	u4420	m293	PETER	I don't know -- how would I know?
L125782	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Why, do you think we're going to?
L125781	u4420	m293	PETER	He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
L125780	u4421	m293	REGGIE	It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
L125779	u4420	m293	PETER	Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
L126407	u4425	m293	TEX	Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
L126406	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Can you give me one good reason why I should?
L126074	u4425	m293	TEX	You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
L126073	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Please stop -- please!
L126072	u4425	m293	TEX	It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
L126070	u4425	m293	TEX	Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
L126069	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Stop that!
L126066	u4425	m293	TEX	Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
L126065	u4421	m293	REGGIE	No -- no, I'm don't.
L126064	u4425	m293	TEX	You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
L126063	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Wha -- what do you want?
L126062	u4425	m293	TEX	Howdy, Miz Lampert.
L125921	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't understa--
L125920	u4425	m293	TEX	Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
L125919	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Yes?
L125918	u4425	m293	TEX	Miz Lampert, ma'am...
L126781	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	We will separate -- you look over there.
L126780	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't see him.
L126779	u4421	m293	REGGIE	A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
L126778	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	What?
L126777	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
L126776	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	What's the matter, chrie?
L126775	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
L126774	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
L126773	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I'm glad. But what's all this?
L126772	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
L126771	u4421	m293	REGGIE	What's he up to?
L126770	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
L126769	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
L126725	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Oh la vache!
L126724	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
L126723	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
L126722	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
L125927	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
L125926	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	What is it about?
L125925	u4421	m293	REGGIE	The American Embassy.
L125924	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Who is it from?
L125915	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	He's allergic to him.
L125914	u4421	m293	REGGIE	How can you tell?
L125913	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	He must have known Charles pretty well.
L125912	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I've never seen him before.
L125911	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Do you know him?
L125910	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
L125909	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Have you no idea who could have done it?
L125908	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
L125907	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
L125906	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Didn't Charles have any friends?
L125905	u4421	m293	REGGIE	It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
L125827	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Don't you want me to stay?
L125826	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	He knows everything.
L125777	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
L125776	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
L125775	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	But that is no reason to get a divorce!
L125774	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Because I don't love him.
L125773	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	But why do you want a divorce?
L125771	u4421	m293	REGGIE	I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
L125770	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	But what?
L125769	u4421	m293	REGGIE	He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
L125768	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	a alors! From Charles?
L125767	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
L125765	u4424	m293	SYLVIE	Va jouer, mon ange.
L125764	u4421	m293	REGGIE	Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
L126432	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	We want that money -- now!
L126431	u4425	m293	TEX	This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
L126425	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Who invited you?
L126424	u4425	m293	TEX	Howdy, Miz Lampert.
L126146	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
L126145	u4425	m293	TEX	Shoot no, not after all these years.
L126140	u4425	m293	TEX	He took care of Charlie for us.
L126139	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	Yeah? What's that?
L126138	u4425	m293	TEX	Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
L126137	u4423	m293	SCOBIE	We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
L127158	u4436	m294	KILLER	Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
L127157	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	You do?
L127156	u4436	m294	KILLER	I think I know how to restore your reputation.
L127155	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
L127154	u4436	m294	KILLER	He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
L127153	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	Why?
L127152	u4436	m294	KILLER	I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
L127151	u4426	m294	ANNETTE	Yeah?
L127582	u4427	m294	BEN	Ok!
L127581	u4430	m294	CINDY	I get the imports.
L127580	u4427	m294	BEN	One more time.
L127542	u4430	m294	CINDY	Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
L127541	u4427	m294	BEN	That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
L127540	u4430	m294	CINDY	Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
L127539	u4427	m294	BEN	Not my imports.
L127538	u4430	m294	CINDY	I get all your CDs.
L127263	u4430	m294	CINDY	Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
L127262	u4427	m294	BEN	WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
L127261	u4430	m294	CINDY	ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
L127260	u4427	m294	BEN	You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
L127259	u4430	m294	CINDY	I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
L127120	u4427	m294	BEN	Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
L127119	u4430	m294	CINDY	I think it's funny.
L127108	u4427	m294	BEN	As fucking if.
L127107	u4430	m294	CINDY	If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
L127106	u4427	m294	BEN	Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
L127105	u4430	m294	CINDY	I never fucked Rod.
L127104	u4427	m294	BEN	What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
L127103	u4430	m294	CINDY	I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
L127102	u4427	m294	BEN	Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
L127288	u4448	m294	TOM	Calm down Brent.
L127287	u4428	m294	BRENT	I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
L127286	u4448	m294	TOM	That's impossible.
L127285	u4428	m294	BRENT	IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
L127201	u4428	m294	BRENT	Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
L127200	u4448	m294	TOM	You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
L127199	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
L127198	u4448	m294	TOM	Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
L127197	u4428	m294	BRENT	is there anything you do?
L127196	u4448	m294	TOM	Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
L127195	u4428	m294	BRENT	If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
L127076	u4448	m294	TOM	Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
L127075	u4428	m294	BRENT	So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
L127074	u4448	m294	TOM	So?
L127073	u4428	m294	BRENT	She's my daughter, Tom.
L127072	u4448	m294	TOM	The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
L127071	u4428	m294	BRENT	Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
L127061	u4428	m294	BRENT	I just wanted to check that you were okay?
L127060	u4448	m294	TOM	Hi Jody.
L127057	u4448	m294	TOM	Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
L127056	u4428	m294	BRENT	But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
L127055	u4448	m294	TOM	Good.
L127054	u4428	m294	BRENT	No.
L127053	u4448	m294	TOM	You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
L127615	u4428	m294	BRENT	Run!
L127614	u4434	m294	JODY	No!
L127294	u4428	m294	BRENT	Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
L127293	u4434	m294	JODY	Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
L127292	u4428	m294	BRENT	What did you hear?
L127291	u4434	m294	JODY	No I wasn't.
L127290	u4428	m294	BRENT	You were eavesdropping.
L127284	u4428	m294	BRENT	Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
L127283	u4434	m294	JODY	Who is she Daddy?
L127282	u4428	m294	BRENT	It can't be.
L127281	u4434	m294	JODY	You know her?
L127249	u4434	m294	JODY	She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
L127248	u4428	m294	BRENT	Are you sure?
L127247	u4434	m294	JODY	It was a she.
L127190	u4428	m294	BRENT	I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
L127189	u4434	m294	JODY	I thought you'd be pleased.
L127188	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm not.
L127187	u4434	m294	JODY	You are upset.
L127186	u4428	m294	BRENT	No honey.
L127185	u4434	m294	JODY	Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
L127184	u4428	m294	BRENT	Ok.
L127182	u4428	m294	BRENT	You never went, uh, all the way?
L127181	u4434	m294	JODY	Not much further.
L127180	u4428	m294	BRENT	I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
L127179	u4434	m294	JODY	Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
L127178	u4428	m294	BRENT	How much further?
L127177	u4434	m294	JODY	A little.
L127176	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
L127175	u4434	m294	JODY	Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
L127174	u4428	m294	BRENT	Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
L127173	u4434	m294	JODY	What do you mean?
L127170	u4428	m294	BRENT	I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
L127169	u4434	m294	JODY	What's wrong?
L127168	u4428	m294	BRENT	Hi honey.
L127068	u4434	m294	JODY	I will. Is that all?
L127067	u4428	m294	BRENT	I want you to head right home after school.
L127066	u4434	m294	JODY	No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
L127065	u4428	m294	BRENT	Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
L127064	u4434	m294	JODY	I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
L127063	u4428	m294	BRENT	How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
L127062	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
L127059	u4434	m294	JODY	Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
L127058	u4428	m294	BRENT	Hi honey.
L127032	u4428	m294	BRENT	They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
L127031	u4434	m294	JODY	Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
L127030	u4428	m294	BRENT	You said that two weeks ago.
L127029	u4434	m294	JODY	It won't happen again.
L127028	u4428	m294	BRENT	Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
L127027	u4434	m294	JODY	What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
L127026	u4428	m294	BRENT	You're grounded Friday night!
L127025	u4434	m294	JODY	Daddy you scared me!
L127024	u4428	m294	BRENT	It's almost ten o'clock.
L127404	u4428	m294	BRENT	I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
L127403	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	We're seeing all the signs in town.
L127402	u4428	m294	BRENT	Are you sure?
L127401	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Should we close down any eruption?
L127400	u4428	m294	BRENT	No?
L127399	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
L127392	u4428	m294	BRENT	No. I'll handle this.
L127391	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	We need you here. I can bring her in.
L127390	u4428	m294	BRENT	There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
L127389	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	You found her?
L127041	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
L127040	u4428	m294	BRENT	What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
L127252	u4428	m294	BRENT	She's underage.
L127251	u4438	m294	MARGE	This will relax her.
L127250	u4428	m294	BRENT	What are you doing?
L127194	u4428	m294	BRENT	No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
L127193	u4438	m294	MARGE	Did you warn her?
L127192	u4428	m294	BRENT	She's still a virgin.
L127191	u4438	m294	MARGE	Well?
L127166	u4438	m294	MARGE	She just turned off her light.
L127165	u4428	m294	BRENT	Is Jody still awake?
L127038	u4428	m294	BRENT	Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
L127037	u4438	m294	MARGE	What happened?
L127491	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
L127490	u4428	m294	BRENT	Why?
L127489	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	Yeah. You should check downstairs.
L127488	u4428	m294	BRENT	Really?
L127487	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
L127486	u4428	m294	BRENT	No, you couldn't.
L127485	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
L127484	u4428	m294	BRENT	No.
L127483	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
L127482	u4428	m294	BRENT	Is there a picture of her somewhere?
L127479	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
L127478	u4428	m294	BRENT	I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
L127477	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I can.
L127476	u4428	m294	BRENT	Can you get inside?
L127475	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
L127474	u4428	m294	BRENT	Can you describe her? How old was she?
L127473	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
L127472	u4428	m294	BRENT	She was murdered?
L127471	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	A bullet to the right cerebellum.
L127470	u4428	m294	BRENT	Of what?
L127469	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
L127468	u4428	m294	BRENT	She works at a church?
L127467	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	St. Michael's.
L127466	u4428	m294	BRENT	You know where I can find her?
L127465	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	She's not here.
L127464	u4428	m294	BRENT	I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
L127463	u4429	m294	CARETAKER	Hello?
L127525	u4431	m294	DAD	No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
L127524	u4445	m294	SANDY	You're not?
L127523	u4431	m294	DAD	Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
L127522	u4445	m294	SANDY	Daddy....
L127521	u4431	m294	DAD	Your brother told us.
L127519	u4431	m294	DAD	I know where you're going.
L127633	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
L127632	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	But I shouldn't shut it down?
L127630	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	Ok.
L127629	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
L127628	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
L127627	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Jesus. Any word from Brent?
L127626	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
L127625	u4432	m294	DEPUTY	Who's?
L127624	u4443	m294	POLICEMAN	We just found another body.
L127665	u4433	m294	JIMMY	I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
L127664	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
L127662	u4433	m294	JIMMY	I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
L127661	u4437	m294	LEONARD	I'm sure you should have failed.
L127660	u4433	m294	JIMMY	You gave me a 'D'.
L127659	u4437	m294	LEONARD	What?
L127658	u4433	m294	JIMMY	You fucked me up!
L127655	u4433	m294	JIMMY	What are you doing here?
L127654	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Pay no attention to me.
L127675	u4437	m294	LEONARD	You think you're my sister?
L127674	u4434	m294	JODY	Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
L127573	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
L127572	u4434	m294	JODY	You're the killed.
L127571	u4437	m294	LEONARD	I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
L127570	u4434	m294	JODY	Yes.
L127569	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
L127568	u4434	m294	JODY	_ Your father raped someone?
L127567	u4437	m294	LEONARD	He's a rapist. Like mine.
L127566	u4434	m294	JODY	What do you know about my father?
L127565	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
L127564	u4434	m294	JODY	Me? Why me?
L127563	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
L127562	u4434	m294	JODY	Really?
L127561	u4437	m294	LEONARD	We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
L127559	u4437	m294	LEONARD	I really do. For your own safety.
L127558	u4434	m294	JODY	You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
L127557	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Then you should go.
L127556	u4434	m294	JODY	Of course I'm scared.
L127555	u4437	m294	LEONARD	of COURSE. You're not scared?
L127554	u4434	m294	JODY	You know about that too?
L127553	u4437	m294	LEONARD	You aren't going to the party?
L127552	u4434	m294	JODY	Sure.
L127551	u4437	m294	LEONARD	Can you just follow me? The back is full?
L127550	u4434	m294	JODY	Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
L127549	u4437	m294	LEONARD	My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
L127548	u4434	m294	JODY	I am.
L127315	u4445	m294	SANDY	Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
L127314	u4434	m294	JODY	I can't right now.
L127313	u4445	m294	SANDY	Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
L127312	u4434	m294	JODY	Stag?
L127311	u4445	m294	SANDY	I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
L127310	u4434	m294	JODY	Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
L127309	u4445	m294	SANDY	Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
L127308	u4434	m294	JODY	You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
L127307	u4445	m294	SANDY	It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
L127306	u4434	m294	JODY	I won't.
L127305	u4445	m294	SANDY	Especially not your dad.
L127304	u4434	m294	JODY	Ok.
L127303	u4445	m294	SANDY	You can't tell your parents.
L127302	u4434	m294	JODY	No.
L127301	u4445	m294	SANDY	Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
L127300	u4434	m294	JODY	What party?
L127299	u4445	m294	SANDY	Mark invited me to the party.
L127298	u4434	m294	JODY	What?
L127297	u4445	m294	SANDY	Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
L127296	u4434	m294	JODY	FINE. Are you?
L127295	u4445	m294	SANDY	You ok?
L127255	u4445	m294	SANDY	The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
L127254	u4434	m294	JODY	Someone tried to kill me.
L127230	u4434	m294	JODY	NO?!
L127229	u4445	m294	SANDY	You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
L127228	u4434	m294	JODY	Not that many.
L127227	u4445	m294	SANDY	There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
L127226	u4434	m294	JODY	Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
L127149	u4445	m294	SANDY	OK. increase the peace.
L127148	u4434	m294	JODY	I promised I'd go right home after school.
L127147	u4445	m294	SANDY	I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
L127146	u4434	m294	JODY	How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
L127145	u4445	m294	SANDY	Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
L127144	u4434	m294	JODY	I don't know what I'm so scared of.
L127143	u4445	m294	SANDY	That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
L127142	u4434	m294	JODY	You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
L127141	u4445	m294	SANDY	No!
L127140	u4434	m294	JODY	Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
L127139	u4445	m294	SANDY	Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
L127138	u4434	m294	JODY	He says he loves me.
L127137	u4445	m294	SANDY	Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
L127136	u4434	m294	JODY	I was desperate. It was gross.
L127135	u4445	m294	SANDY	Oh nice save.
L127131	u4445	m294	SANDY	I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
L127130	u4434	m294	JODY	Does she fuck?
L127129	u4445	m294	SANDY	He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
L127128	u4434	m294	JODY	But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
L127127	u4445	m294	SANDY	You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
L127126	u4434	m294	JODY	You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
L127125	u4445	m294	SANDY	You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
L127124	u4434	m294	JODY	You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
L127123	u4445	m294	SANDY	What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
L127095	u4434	m294	JODY	You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
L127094	u4445	m294	SANDY	No! That's his table.
L127092	u4445	m294	SANDY	Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
L127091	u4434	m294	JODY	You eventually have to talk to him.
L127090	u4445	m294	SANDY	The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
L127089	u4434	m294	JODY	You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
L127088	u4445	m294	SANDY	I don't watch him eat everyday.
L127087	u4434	m294	JODY	Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
L127086	u4445	m294	SANDY	Why?
L127085	u4434	m294	JODY	Mark Shale.
L127084	u4445	m294	SANDY	Who?
L127083	u4434	m294	JODY	Go sit next to him.
L127419	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
L127418	u4434	m294	JODY	No.
L127417	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
L127416	u4434	m294	JODY	You Miss Dunlop?
L127415	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
L127414	u4434	m294	JODY	Don't you think it's sick?
L127413	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
L127412	u4434	m294	JODY	You heard about that?
L127411	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Everyone's getting ready for the party.
L127410	u4434	m294	JODY	This place is empty.
L127409	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Follow me.
L127408	u4434	m294	JODY	Twenty eight years ago.
L127407	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
L127406	u4434	m294	JODY	Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
L127405	u4440	m294	MISS DUNLOP	Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
L127648	u4435	m294	KENNY	Pretend we're just another couple.
L127647	u4434	m294	JODY	What are you doing?
L127644	u4435	m294	KENNY	Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
L127643	u4434	m294	JODY	Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
L127635	u4435	m294	KENNY	I love you.
L127634	u4434	m294	JODY	Thanks for coming back for me.
L127621	u4435	m294	KENNY	Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
L127620	u4434	m294	JODY	Go to the police station!
L127617	u4435	m294	KENNY	He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
L127616	u4434	m294	JODY	My dad's down there!
L127518	u4434	m294	JODY	Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
L127517	u4435	m294	KENNY	I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
L127516	u4434	m294	JODY	What?
L127515	u4435	m294	KENNY	Jody. Wait.
L127514	u4434	m294	JODY	This party is sick.
L127513	u4435	m294	KENNY	Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
L127512	u4435	m294	KENNY	Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
L127511	u4434	m294	JODY	And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
L127510	u4435	m294	KENNY	Sharon's far from a slut.
L127509	u4434	m294	JODY	You flaunt some slut in my face.
L127508	u4435	m294	KENNY	That's not why we broke up.
L127507	u4434	m294	JODY	You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
L127506	u4435	m294	KENNY	Yeah.
L127505	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm making you feel like meat?
L127504	u4435	m294	KENNY	Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
L127503	u4434	m294	JODY	What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
L127501	u4434	m294	JODY	Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
L127500	u4435	m294	KENNY	Are you coming to the party?
L127499	u4435	m294	KENNY	I don't know. I kind of am.
L127498	u4434	m294	JODY	So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
L127497	u4435	m294	KENNY	But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
L127496	u4434	m294	JODY	I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
L127495	u4435	m294	KENNY	I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
L127494	u4434	m294	JODY	My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
L127493	u4435	m294	KENNY	All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
L127363	u4435	m294	KENNY	Yes!
L127362	u4434	m294	JODY	I'll think about it.
L127361	u4435	m294	KENNY	They're not picking me up until six.
L127360	u4434	m294	JODY	I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
L127359	u4435	m294	KENNY	I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
L127358	u4434	m294	JODY	I do not.
L127357	u4435	m294	KENNY	Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
L127356	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm not using him as an excuse.
L127355	u4435	m294	KENNY	If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
L127354	u4434	m294	JODY	No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
L127353	u4435	m294	KENNY	Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
L127352	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
L127351	u4435	m294	KENNY	You know I want to go with you.
L127350	u4434	m294	JODY	Did Sharon say no?
L127349	u4435	m294	KENNY	Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
L127348	u4434	m294	JODY	Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
L127347	u4435	m294	KENNY	Why?
L127346	u4434	m294	JODY	Yeah. I think it's really sick.
L127345	u4435	m294	KENNY	I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
L127344	u4434	m294	JODY	I did.
L127343	u4435	m294	KENNY	I heard you got attacked.
L127342	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm fine.
L127341	u4435	m294	KENNY	Are you O.K.?
L127023	u4435	m294	KENNY	Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
L127022	u4434	m294	JODY	What?
L127021	u4435	m294	KENNY	You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
L127019	u4435	m294	KENNY	Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
L127018	u4434	m294	JODY	I got to get home.
L127017	u4435	m294	KENNY	So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
L127016	u4434	m294	JODY	I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
L127015	u4435	m294	KENNY	Why?
L127014	u4434	m294	JODY	Cut it out.
L127461	u4434	m294	JODY	NO!
L127460	u4438	m294	MARGE	Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
L127459	u4434	m294	JODY	THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
L127456	u4434	m294	JODY	Who was the fourth?
L127455	u4438	m294	MARGE	Yes.
L127454	u4434	m294	JODY	The principal?
L127453	u4438	m294	MARGE	Mr. Sisler was one of them.
L127452	u4434	m294	JODY	You're not telling me something.
L127451	u4438	m294	MARGE	Two men left town right after it happened.
L127450	u4434	m294	JODY	The men. Do any of them still live around here?
L127449	u4438	m294	MARGE	Who?
L127448	u4434	m294	JODY	Who were they?
L127447	u4438	m294	MARGE	I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
L127446	u4434	m294	JODY	The word is Mob.
L127445	u4438	m294	MARGE	I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
L127444	u4434	m294	JODY	How could you?
L127443	u4438	m294	MARGE	EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
L127442	u4434	m294	JODY	And the police did nothing?
L127441	u4438	m294	MARGE	They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
L127440	u4434	m294	JODY	People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
L127439	u4438	m294	MARGE	They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
L127438	u4434	m294	JODY	Why not?
L127437	u4438	m294	MARGE	No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
L127436	u4434	m294	JODY	You didn't believe her?
L127435	u4438	m294	MARGE	She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
L127434	u4434	m294	JODY	Attacked how?
L127433	u4438	m294	MARGE	Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
L127432	u4434	m294	JODY	I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
L127431	u4438	m294	MARGE	What?
L127430	u4434	m294	JODY	Wait.
L127427	u4438	m294	MARGE	Don't make me order you.
L127426	u4434	m294	JODY	Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
L127425	u4438	m294	MARGE	She's nobody you should be concerned with.
L127424	u4434	m294	JODY	Who is she?
L127423	u4438	m294	MARGE	I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
L127387	u4434	m294	JODY	The library. I'll be fine.
L127386	u4438	m294	MARGE	Where are you going?
L127385	u4438	m294	MARGE	Not that I know of.
L127384	u4434	m294	JODY	No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
L127383	u4438	m294	MARGE	I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
L127382	u4434	m294	JODY	No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
L127381	u4438	m294	MARGE	Did he say anything else about her?
L127380	u4434	m294	JODY	That's what he said.
L127379	u4438	m294	MARGE	What?
L127378	u4434	m294	JODY	I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
L127377	u4438	m294	MARGE	I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
L127376	u4434	m294	JODY	Yeah. Who is she?
L127375	u4438	m294	MARGE	Lisa Sherman?
L127374	u4434	m294	JODY	Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
L127373	u4438	m294	MARGE	You can ask me anything.
L127372	u4434	m294	JODY	I need to ask you something.
L127371	u4438	m294	MARGE	Yes?
L127370	u4434	m294	JODY	Mom?
L127369	u4438	m294	MARGE	Hi princess.
L127368	u4434	m294	JODY	Hi mom.
L127245	u4434	m294	JODY	His mother's an only child.
L127244	u4436	m294	KILLER	His mother's side.
L127243	u4434	m294	JODY	On what side of the family?
L127242	u4436	m294	KILLER	Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
L127241	u4434	m294	JODY	Kenny's aunt?
L127240	u4436	m294	KILLER	I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
L127239	u4434	m294	JODY	Yeah.
L127238	u4436	m294	KILLER	Are you Jody?
L127237	u4434	m294	JODY	Yes?
L127591	u4435	m294	KENNY	I'm worried about someone.
L127590	u4446	m294	SHARON	What?
L127589	u4435	m294	KENNY	I got to go.
L127588	u4446	m294	SHARON	What are you doing?
L127587	u4446	m294	SHARON	I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
L127586	u4435	m294	KENNY	There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
L127585	u4446	m294	SHARON	What?
L127584	u4435	m294	KENNY	Just thinking about something.
L127583	u4446	m294	SHARON	You ok?
L127577	u4445	m294	SANDY	You're the one who's hand is shaking.
L127576	u4439	m294	MARK	Now don't be nervous.
L127575	u4445	m294	SANDY	So are you.
L127574	u4439	m294	MARK	You're so beautiful.
L127276	u4445	m294	SANDY	No, you keep one.
L127275	u4439	m294	MARK	You can have both if you want.
L127273	u4439	m294	MARK	They're tasty.
L127272	u4445	m294	SANDY	Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
L127271	u4439	m294	MARK	Did you want one?
L127270	u4445	m294	SANDY	You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
L127265	u4439	m294	MARK	Hi Sandy.
L127264	u4445	m294	SANDY	Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
L127116	u4445	m294	SANDY	And she didn't?
L127115	u4439	m294	MARK	Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
L127579	u4441	m294	NERD 1	Told you to hide it.
L127578	u4442	m294	NERD 2	Hey! That was a 3k machine.
L127533	u4442	m294	NERD 2	I'm not leaving it here.
L127532	u4441	m294	NERD 1	You can't bring it.
L127531	u4442	m294	NERD 2	No.
L127530	u4441	m294	NERD 1	Hide your laptop here.
L127529	u4442	m294	NERD 2	Ok.
L127528	u4441	m294	NERD 1	There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
L127012	u4447	m294	STACY	ROD!
L127011	u4444	m294	ROD	Stacy?
L127002	u4444	m294	ROD	Yes. Unfair to me.
L127001	u4447	m294	STACY	Unfair?!
L127000	u4444	m294	ROD	You're being unfair.
L126999	u4447	m294	STACY	Rod!
L126997	u4447	m294	STACY	I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
L126996	u4444	m294	ROD	Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
L126995	u4447	m294	STACY	I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
L126994	u4444	m294	ROD	That wasn't me ...
L126993	u4447	m294	STACY	If sheep don't count.
L126992	u4444	m294	ROD	On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
L126991	u4447	m294	STACY	Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
L126990	u4444	m294	ROD	Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
L126989	u4447	m294	STACY	What?
L126988	u4444	m294	ROD	Let me just ask you a serious question first.
L126987	u4447	m294	STACY	Maybe you better just drive me home.
L126986	u4444	m294	ROD	Maybe it won't stay in.
L126984	u4444	m294	ROD	But you don't really mean it.
L126983	u4447	m294	STACY	I said no.
L129752	u4468	m296	BARNEY	So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
L129751	u4477	m296	GITTES	An honest living.
L129750	u4468	m296	BARNEY	'Course you do, Jake.
L129749	u4477	m296	GITTES	I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact ? it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
L129746	u4468	m296	BARNEY	Jake, for Christ's sake.
L129745	u4477	m296	GITTES	Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
L129744	u4468	m296	BARNEY	Take it easy, Jake.
L129743	u4477	m296	GITTES	Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
L129733	u4468	m296	BARNEY	Heat's murder.
L129732	u4477	m296	GITTES	Look at that.
L130274	u4477	m296	GITTES	The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
L130273	u4469	m296	CLERK	A ruler?
L130272	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, then, how about a ruler?
L130271	u4469	m296	CLERK	Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
L130270	u4477	m296	GITTES	Can I check one of these volumes out?
L130269	u4469	m296	CLERK	If that's what it says.
L130268	u4477	m296	GITTES	But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
L130267	u4469	m296	CLERK	That's right.
L130266	u4477	m296	GITTES	Then these are all new owners?
L130265	u4469	m296	CLERK	Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
L130264	u4477	m296	GITTES	How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
L130261	u4469	m296	CLERK	Row twenty-three, section C.
L130260	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'll settle for L.A. County.
L130730	u4477	m296	GITTES	Who do you blame for that? Her?
L130729	u4470	m296	CROSS	The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
L130728	u4477	m296	GITTES	Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
L130727	u4470	m296	CROSS	Oh, my, yes.
L130726	u4477	m296	GITTES	I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
L130725	u4470	m296	CROSS	I have no idea. How much do you want?
L130724	u4477	m296	GITTES	How much are you worth?
L130723	u4470	m296	CROSS	Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
L130722	u4477	m296	GITTES	How do you do that?
L130721	u4470	m296	CROSS	That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
L130720	u4477	m296	GITTES	There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
L130719	u4470	m296	CROSS	No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
L130718	u4477	m296	GITTES	And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
L130717	u4470	m296	CROSS	That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
L130716	u4477	m296	GITTES	Haven't the faintest idea.
L130715	u4470	m296	CROSS	Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
L130714	u4477	m296	GITTES	...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
L130712	u4477	m296	GITTES	That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
L130711	u4470	m296	CROSS	What does this mean?
L130710	u4470	m296	CROSS	Yes... I think I can manage...
L130709	u4477	m296	GITTES	An obituary column... can you read in this light?
L130708	u4470	m296	CROSS	What is it?
L130707	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
L130705	u4477	m296	GITTES	With her mother.
L130704	u4470	m296	CROSS	Where is she?
L130703	u4477	m296	GITTES	She's fine.
L130702	u4470	m296	CROSS	Is she all right?
L130701	u4477	m296	GITTES	I've got her.
L130700	u4470	m296	CROSS	Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
L130257	u4477	m296	GITTES	We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
L130256	u4470	m296	CROSS	Avocado groves?
L130255	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
L130254	u4470	m296	CROSS	Just find the girl.
L130253	u4477	m296	GITTES	Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
L130252	u4470	m296	CROSS	I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
L130251	u4477	m296	GITTES	How did you find out?
L130250	u4470	m296	CROSS	Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
L130249	u4477	m296	GITTES	If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
L130248	u4470	m296	CROSS	Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
L130247	u4477	m296	GITTES	I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
L130246	u4470	m296	CROSS	Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
L130245	u4477	m296	GITTES	What about her?
L130244	u4470	m296	CROSS	My daughter.
L130243	u4477	m296	GITTES	I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
L130242	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
L130241	u4470	m296	CROSS	At my age, you tend to lose track...
L130240	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
L130239	u4470	m296	CROSS	Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
L130238	u4477	m296	GITTES	When was the last time?
L130237	u4470	m296	CROSS	No.
L130236	u4477	m296	GITTES	You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
L130235	u4470	m296	CROSS	If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
L130234	u4477	m296	GITTES	Maybe.
L130233	u4470	m296	CROSS	Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
L130232	u4477	m296	GITTES	No. She's probably scared to death.
L130231	u4470	m296	CROSS	Doesn't that strike you as odd?
L130230	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah.
L130229	u4470	m296	CROSS	Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
L130228	u4477	m296	GITTES	You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
L130227	u4470	m296	CROSS	Yes, his girlfriend.
L130226	u4477	m296	GITTES	His girlfriend?
L130225	u4470	m296	CROSS	'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
L130224	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
L130223	u4470	m296	CROSS	...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
L130222	u4470	m296	CROSS	Was he right?
L130221	u4477	m296	GITTES	It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
L130220	u4470	m296	CROSS	Why is that funny?
L130219	u4470	m296	CROSS	You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
L130218	u4477	m296	GITTES	What for?
L130217	u4470	m296	CROSS	Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
L130216	u4477	m296	GITTES	If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
L130215	u4470	m296	CROSS	Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
L130214	u4477	m296	GITTES	My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
L130213	u4470	m296	CROSS	It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
L130212	u4477	m296	GITTES	Too bad?
L130211	u4470	m296	CROSS	That's too bad.
L130210	u4477	m296	GITTES	None.
L130209	u4470	m296	CROSS	Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
L130208	u4477	m296	GITTES	Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
L130207	u4470	m296	CROSS	Honest?
L130206	u4477	m296	GITTES	Very.
L130205	u4470	m296	CROSS	Would you call him a capable man?
L130204	u4477	m296	GITTES	We worked in Chinatown together.
L130203	u4470	m296	CROSS	Where from?
L130202	u4477	m296	GITTES	Oh yes.
L130201	u4470	m296	CROSS	Do you know him?
L130200	u4477	m296	GITTES	Lou Escobar ? he's a Lieutenant.
L130199	u4470	m296	CROSS	Who's the investigating officer?
L130198	u4477	m296	GITTES	They're calling it an accident.
L130197	u4470	m296	CROSS	Tell me. What do the police say?
L130196	u4477	m296	GITTES	Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
L130194	u4477	m296	GITTES	I think I gave it to her.
L130193	u4470	m296	CROSS	How did she get that idea?
L130192	u4477	m296	GITTES	No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
L130191	u4470	m296	CROSS	But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
L130190	u4477	m296	GITTES	Probably.
L130189	u4470	m296	CROSS	It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
L130188	u4477	m296	GITTES	It doesn't hurt.
L130187	u4470	m296	CROSS	If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
L130186	u4477	m296	GITTES	Thanks.
L130185	u4470	m296	CROSS	You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
L130183	u4470	m296	CROSS	What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
L130182	u4477	m296	GITTES	Always?
L130179	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
L130178	u4470	m296	CROSS	I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
L130177	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sir?
L130570	u4477	m296	GITTES	Just bring your checkbook.
L130569	u4471	m296	CROSS' VOICE	What are you talking about?
L130568	u4477	m296	GITTES	Either that or she'll be in jail.
L130567	u4471	m296	CROSS' VOICE	Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
L130566	u4477	m296	GITTES	At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
L130565	u4471	m296	CROSS' VOICE	Of course I do. Where are you?
L130564	u4477	m296	GITTES	Do you remember the figures we discussed?
L130563	u4471	m296	CROSS' VOICE	You've got her? Where?
L130562	u4477	m296	GITTES	Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
L130561	u4471	m296	CROSS' VOICE	Hello.
L130698	u4477	m296	GITTES	Curly, you know how long I been in business.
L130697	u4472	m296	CURLY	You sure this is okay?
L130696	u4477	m296	GITTES	Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
L130695	u4472	m296	CURLY	Okay, you got yourself a boat.
L130694	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'll throw that in too.
L130693	u4472	m296	CURLY	Plus what I owe you?
L130692	u4477	m296	GITTES	I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
L130691	u4472	m296	CURLY	I don't know...
L130690	u4477	m296	GITTES	Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
L130689	u4472	m296	CURLY	Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
L130688	u4477	m296	GITTES	How much do you owe me, Curly?
L130684	u4477	m296	GITTES	Tell her later.
L130683	u4472	m296	CURLY	I'll just tell my wife.
L130682	u4477	m296	GITTES	Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
L130681	u4472	m296	CURLY	Sure, as soon as we eat.
L130680	u4477	m296	GITTES	Could you drive me somewhere?
L130679	u4472	m296	CURLY	Off the alley.
L130678	u4477	m296	GITTES	Where's that?
L130677	u4472	m296	CURLY	In the garage.
L130676	u4477	m296	GITTES	Curly, where's your car?
L130675	u4472	m296	CURLY	Sure thing.
L130672	u4472	m296	CURLY	How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
L130671	u4477	m296	GITTES	No thanks.
L130670	u4472	m296	CURLY	Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
L130669	u4477	m296	GITTES	Call me Jake. How is everything?
L130668	u4472	m296	CURLY	Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
L129667	u4477	m296	GITTES	Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
L129666	u4472	m296	CURLY	Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
L129665	u4477	m296	GITTES	What kind of guy do you think I am?
L129663	u4477	m296	GITTES	Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
L129662	u4472	m296	CURLY	I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
L129661	u4477	m296	GITTES	You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
L129660	u4472	m296	CURLY	...No...
L129658	u4472	m296	CURLY	Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
L129657	u4477	m296	GITTES	Oh they don't?
L129656	u4472	m296	CURLY	They don't kill a guy for that.
L129653	u4472	m296	CURLY	I think I'll kill her.
L129652	u4477	m296	GITTES	What's that, Curly?
L129651	u4472	m296	CURLY	Thanks. You know something, Jake?
L129650	u4477	m296	GITTES	Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
L129649	u4472	m296	CURLY	You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
L129648	u4477	m296	GITTES	You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
L129647	u4472	m296	CURLY	Ain't worth thinking about.
L129646	u4477	m296	GITTES	What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
L129645	u4472	m296	CURLY	She's just no good.
L129986	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sue the shit out of 'em.
L129985	u4473	m296	DUFFY	Then what'll you do?
L129782	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
L129781	u4473	m296	DUFFY	I said okay, Jake.
L129780	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's a filthy habit.
L129779	u4473	m296	DUFFY	Okay.
L129778	u4477	m296	GITTES	There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
L129760	u4477	m296	GITTES	Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
L129759	u4473	m296	DUFFY	Jake, listen.
L129758	u4477	m296	GITTES	So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
L130375	u4477	m296	GITTES	But what?
L130374	u4474	m296	EMMA	Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but ?-
L130373	u4477	m296	GITTES	How do they do that?
L130372	u4474	m296	EMMA	No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
L130371	u4477	m296	GITTES	The apple core?
L130370	u4474	m296	EMMA	The apple core club.
L130369	u4477	m296	GITTES	Where did you get this material?
L130368	u4474	m296	EMMA	Thank you...
L130367	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's just lovely.
L130366	u4474	m296	EMMA	Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
L130365	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well you own a lot of land.
L130364	u4474	m296	EMMA	I'm not.
L130363	u4477	m296	GITTES	Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
L130362	u4474	m296	EMMA	Why?
L130361	u4477	m296	GITTES	I've been wanting to meet you.
L130360	u4474	m296	EMMA	Yes.
L130764	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
L130763	u4477	m296	GITTES	Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
L130762	u4477	m296	GITTES	An accident?
L130761	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
L130760	u4477	m296	GITTES	Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
L130755	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Gittes, stay outta this.
L130754	u4477	m296	GITTES	Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
L130753	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130752	u4477	m296	GITTES	Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
L130751	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
L130750	u4477	m296	GITTES	Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
L130749	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
L130665	u4477	m296	GITTES	Gee, thanks, Lou.
L130664	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Give you three minutes.
L130663	u4477	m296	GITTES	I guess not.
L130662	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You never learn, do you, Gittes?
L130660	u4477	m296	GITTES	Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
L130659	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Well, let's go.
L130658	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah.
L130657	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	That's it?
L130656	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
L130655	u4477	m296	GITTES	Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
L130654	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
L130653	u4477	m296	GITTES	What for?
L130652	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	No, Gittes, you'll show us.
L130651	u4477	m296	GITTES	She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
L130650	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	What's the maid's address?
L130649	u4477	m296	GITTES	Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
L130648	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Where?
L130647	u4477	m296	GITTES	Matter of fact I do.
L130646	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
L130544	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Shut up.  Go on.
L130543	u4477	m296	GITTES	I know what he says.
L130538	u4477	m296	GITTES	They only dump the water at night.
L130537	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Too late for what?
L130536	u4477	m296	GITTES	It's too late.
L130534	u4477	m296	GITTES	C'mon I'll show you.
L130533	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	What are you talking about?
L130532	u4477	m296	GITTES	He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
L130531	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	And why's that?
L130530	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
L130529	u4477	m296	GITTES	Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
L130528	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
L130527	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
L130526	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
L130525	u4477	m296	GITTES	I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
L130524	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Absolutely.
L130523	u4477	m296	GITTES	You accusing me of extortion?
L130522	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
L130521	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
L130520	u4477	m296	GITTES	I heard it was an accident.
L130519	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
L130518	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah?
L130517	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
L130516	u4477	m296	GITTES	What pictures?
L130515	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	I want the rest of the pictures.
L130514	u4477	m296	GITTES	I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
L130513	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
L130511	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	How did she...  ...happen to have them?
L130510	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
L130506	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
L130505	u4477	m296	GITTES	Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
L130504	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Isn't that your number?
L130503	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Let me show you something.
L130502	u4477	m296	GITTES	I don't.
L130501	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	How do you happen to know her?
L130500	u4477	m296	GITTES	Didn't you call?
L130499	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	What are you doing here?
L129938	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	When I do, you'll hear about it.
L129937	u4477	m296	GITTES	Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
L129936	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
L129933	u4477	m296	GITTES	You mean that's what you're going to call it.
L129932	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	No. It was an accident.
L129931	u4477	m296	GITTES	No?
L129930	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	I don't want it anymore.
L129918	u4477	m296	GITTES	No.
L129917	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Or her name?
L129916	u4477	m296	GITTES	No.
L129915	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
L129892	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You're welcome to try. There he is.
L129891	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'd like to talk to him.
L129890	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Oh yes.
L129889	u4477	m296	GITTES	Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
L129888	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Who?
L129887	u4477	m296	GITTES	Looking for someone.
L129886	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
L129885	u4477	m296	GITTES	Congratulations.
L129884	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Since I made Lieutenant.
L129883	u4477	m296	GITTES	Since when?
L129882	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
L129879	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
L129878	u4477	m296	GITTES	I get by.
L129877	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You've done well by yourself.
L129876	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
L129875	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	How'd you get past the guards?
L129874	u4477	m296	GITTES	Thanks, Lou.
L129871	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Yeah, they are.
L129870	u4477	m296	GITTES	Summer colds are the worst.
L129869	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
L129868	u4477	m296	GITTES	How are you, Lou?
L129867	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Hello, Jake.
L129920	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
L129919	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
L129911	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Well yes.
L129910	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Mr. Gittes.
L129909	u4476	m296	EVELYN	A private investigator?
L129908	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
L129907	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes.
L129906	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	A complete surprise?
L129905	u4476	m296	EVELYN	He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
L129904	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	You and your husband never discussed her?
L129903	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Certainly not!
L129902	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Do you know where she might be?
L129901	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No.
L129900	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
L129899	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No.
L129898	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
L129897	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...Well, it didn't make him happy...
L129895	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
L129894	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Of course.
L129893	u4475	m296	ESCOBAR	It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
L130742	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
L130741	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I'm all right.
L130740	u4477	m296	GITTES	Let me handle that.
L130634	u4476	m296	EVELYN	He didn't wear bifocals.
L130633	u4477	m296	GITTES	How do you know?
L130631	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Okay...
L130630	u4477	m296	GITTES	On his day off. Get the exact address.
L130629	u4476	m296	EVELYN	With us.
L130628	u4477	m296	GITTES	...where does Kyo live?
L130627	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Where can we go?
L130626	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'll take care of it.
L130625	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I have to go home and get my things.
L130624	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
L130623	u4476	m296	EVELYN	How about a plane?
L130622	u4477	m296	GITTES	You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
L130621	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Back to Mexico.
L130620	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah... where are you taking her now?
L130618	u4477	m296	GITTES	...so that's why you hate him...
L130617	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
L130616	u4477	m296	GITTES	To Mexico...
L130615	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
L130612	u4476	m296	EVELYN	She's my sister and my daughter!
L130611	u4477	m296	GITTES	I said I want the truth.
L130607	u4476	m296	EVELYN	She's my sister.
L130606	u4477	m296	GITTES	I said the truth!
L130605	u4476	m296	EVELYN	She's my daughter.
L130604	u4477	m296	GITTES	Katherine?... Katherine who?
L130603	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Katherine.
L130602	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's good. Now what's her name?
L130600	u4477	m296	GITTES	Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
L130599	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...no...
L130598	u4477	m296	GITTES	Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
L130597	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
L130596	u4477	m296	GITTES	There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
L130595	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What are you saying?
L130594	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
L130593	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
L130592	u4477	m296	GITTES	I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
L130591	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What the hell is this all about?
L130590	u4477	m296	GITTES	Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
L130589	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No...
L130588	u4477	m296	GITTES	You know any good criminal lawyers?
L130587	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What did you do that for?
L130586	u4477	m296	GITTES	You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
L130585	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
L130584	u4477	m296	GITTES	J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
L130583	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
L130582	u4477	m296	GITTES	Going somewhere?
L130581	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
L130580	u4477	m296	GITTES	I want to see her.
L130579	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Upstairs. Why?
L130578	u4477	m296	GITTES	Where's the girl?
L130577	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
L130576	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sure.
L130575	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Did you get some sleep?
L130487	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...That's not what I meant.
L130486	u4477	m296	GITTES	Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
L130485	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Aren't you coming back with me?
L130484	u4477	m296	GITTES	I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
L130482	u4477	m296	GITTES	Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
L130481	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I can't...
L130478	u4477	m296	GITTES	I will if you don't.
L130477	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You won't go to the police if I tell you?
L130476	u4477	m296	GITTES	Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
L130475	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You're insane.
L130474	u4477	m296	GITTES	Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
L130473	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What does it look like?
L130472	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130471	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes.
L130470	u4477	m296	GITTES	You mean she just found out?
L130469	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
L130468	u4477	m296	GITTES	What about?
L130467	u4476	m296	EVELYN	She's too upset.
L130465	u4477	m296	GITTES	Then let's go talk to her.
L130464	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I am not!
L130463	u4477	m296	GITTES	You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
L130462	u4476	m296	EVELYN	She's not tied up!
L130461	u4477	m296	GITTES	C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
L130460	u4476	m296	EVELYN	The police?
L130459	u4477	m296	GITTES	It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
L130458	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You bastard.
L130457	u4477	m296	GITTES	Okay, give me the keys.
L130456	u4476	m296	EVELYN	It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
L130455	u4477	m296	GITTES	Including the death of your husband?
L130454	u4476	m296	EVELYN	It's possible.
L130453	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
L130452	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
L130451	u4477	m296	GITTES	Give me an example.
L130450	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
L130449	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
L130448	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Do? To who?
L130447	u4477	m296	GITTES	That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
L130446	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What did he say?  What did he say?
L130445	u4477	m296	GITTES	There hasn't been a lot of time.
L130444	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You didn't tell me.
L130443	u4477	m296	GITTES	This morning.
L130442	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You saw my fa... father? When?
L130441	u4477	m296	GITTES	I saw him.
L130440	u4476	m296	EVELYN	He owns it. You know?
L130439	u4477	m296	GITTES	I know.
L130438	u4476	m296	EVELYN	It has to do with my father.
L130437	u4477	m296	GITTES	The Albacore Club.
L130436	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
L130435	u4477	m296	GITTES	Where are you going?
L130434	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
L130433	u4477	m296	GITTES	And I want to know where.
L130432	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Just... I have to.
L130431	u4477	m296	GITTES	Where?
L130428	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
L130427	u4477	m296	GITTES	...A flaw...
L130426	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
L130425	u4477	m296	GITTES	There's something black in the green part of your eye.
L130424	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What about it?
L130423	u4477	m296	GITTES	Your eye.
L130422	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What's wrong?
L130420	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Could you do anything about it?
L130419	u4477	m296	GITTES	I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
L130418	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...No. Why was it.
L130417	u4477	m296	GITTES	You can't always tell what's going on there.
L130416	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Hold still. Why?
L130415	u4477	m296	GITTES	Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
L130414	u4476	m296	EVELYN	So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
L130413	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah.
L130412	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
L130407	u4477	m296	GITTES	They do in Chinatown.
L130406	u4476	m296	EVELYN	The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
L130405	u4477	m296	GITTES	As little as possible.
L130404	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Doing what?
L130403	u4477	m296	GITTES	Working for the District Attorney.
L130402	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What were you doing there?
L130401	u4477	m296	GITTES	It was in Chinatown.
L130400	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
L130399	u4477	m296	GITTES	Why?
L130398	u4476	m296	EVELYN	When was the last time?
L130397	u4477	m296	GITTES	Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
L130396	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
L130395	u4477	m296	GITTES	What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
L130394	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
L130393	u4477	m296	GITTES	I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
L130392	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
L130391	u4477	m296	GITTES	Easy, it's an innocent question.
L130390	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I gave everybody the night off.
L130389	u4477	m296	GITTES	What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
L130388	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Why?
L130387	u4477	m296	GITTES	Maid's night off?
L130383	u4477	m296	GITTES	Get in the car.
L130382	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I'll stay.
L130356	u4477	m296	GITTES	They may not know it but they are.
L130355	u4476	m296	EVELYN	They can't be.
L130354	u4477	m296	GITTES	You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
L130330	u4477	m296	GITTES	Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
L130329	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Is that unusual?
L130328	u4477	m296	GITTES	There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
L130327	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What? What is it?
L130326	u4477	m296	GITTES	We got it. We got it, baby.
L130325	u4477	m296	GITTES	It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
L130324	u4476	m296	EVELYN	And Hollis knew about it?
L130323	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
L130322	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No, I think I'd remember.
L130321	u4477	m296	GITTES	Know him?
L130320	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Jasper Lamar Crabb?
L130319	u4477	m296	GITTES	In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
L130318	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No.
L130317	u4477	m296	GITTES	Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
L130316	u4476	m296	EVELYN	The Valley?
L130315	u4477	m296	GITTES	The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
L130314	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What dam?
L130313	u4477	m296	GITTES	That dam is a con job.
L130150	u4477	m296	GITTES	Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
L130149	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What are you thinking?
L130147	u4477	m296	GITTES	What about you? Do you and your father get along?
L130146	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Of course I'm sure.
L130145	u4477	m296	GITTES	You sure shout that?
L130144	u4476	m296	EVELYN	For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
L130143	u4477	m296	GITTES	Never forgave him for what?
L130142	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes. He never forgave him for it.
L130141	u4477	m296	GITTES	Oh, yeah?
L130140	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
L130139	u4477	m296	GITTES	Then it was over the water department.
L130138	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
L130137	u4477	m296	GITTES	Over the water department, or over you?
L130136	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
L130135	u4477	m296	GITTES	Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
L130134	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Oh.
L130133	u4477	m296	GITTES	You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130132	u4477	m296	GITTES	So you married your father's business partner?
L130131	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
L130130	u4477	m296	GITTES	Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
L130128	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
L130127	u4477	m296	GITTES	Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
L130126	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
L130076	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
L130075	u4477	m296	GITTES	Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
L130074	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
L130068	u4477	m296	GITTES	Another satisfied client's wife.
L130067	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Another satisfied client?
L130062	u4477	m296	GITTES	More like other people putting their business in my nose.
L130061	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
L130060	u4477	m296	GITTES	Been meaning to talk to you about that.
L130059	u4476	m296	EVELYN	How did it happen?
L130056	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I don't believe you.
L130055	u4477	m296	GITTES	No, not for that one.
L130054	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
L130053	u4477	m296	GITTES	No. I'm just a snoop.
L130052	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You must've had a reason to ask me that.
L130051	u4477	m296	GITTES	No reason.
L130050	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes... why?
L130049	u4477	m296	GITTES	That your maiden name?
L130048	u4476	m296	EVELYN	K... Cross.
L130046	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
L130045	u4477	m296	GITTES	For very long?
L130044	u4477	m296	GITTES	You were seeing someone, too.
L130043	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I mean I can't tell you.
L130042	u4477	m296	GITTES	You mean you don't know where you were?
L130041	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I can't tell you.
L130040	u4477	m296	GITTES	Where you were when your husband died.
L130039	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Is there anything else you want to know?
L130038	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
L130037	u4477	m296	GITTES	Did he know?
L130036	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Mr. Gittes.
L130035	u4477	m296	GITTES	Did you have affairs?
L130034	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I don't like the word 'cheat.'
L130032	u4477	m296	GITTES	She's cheating on him.
L130031	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Unless what?
L130030	u4477	m296	GITTES	Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
L130029	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Why?
L130028	u4477	m296	GITTES	You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130027	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I was grateful.
L130026	u4477	m296	GITTES	And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
L130025	u4477	m296	GITTES	He told you?
L130024	u4476	m296	EVELYN	My husband.
L130023	u4477	m296	GITTES	How did you find out?
L130022	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
L130020	u4476	m296	EVELYN	But he wasn't killed.
L130019	u4477	m296	GITTES	If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
L130018	u4476	m296	EVELYN	It wasn't much of a lie.
L130017	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
L130016	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
L130015	u4477	m296	GITTES	I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
L130014	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I have?
L130013	u4477	m296	GITTES	Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
L130012	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Well, how much would you like?
L130011	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
L130010	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
L130009	u4477	m296	GITTES	I got your check in the mall.
L129927	u4477	m296	GITTES	A check?
L129926	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
L129925	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Oh... thank you.
L129924	u4477	m296	GITTES	You left your keys in the ignition.
L129923	u4476	m296	EVELYN	...Just a minute...
L129922	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
L129859	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Please call first.
L129858	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'll stop by.
L129857	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
L129856	u4477	m296	GITTES	Looks like you went quite a distance.
L129855	u4476	m296	EVELYN	No. I went riding rather early.
L129854	u4477	m296	GITTES	Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
L129853	u4476	m296	EVELYN	It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
L129852	u4477	m296	GITTES	Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
L129851	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
L129850	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
L129849	u4476	m296	EVELYN	You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
L129848	u4477	m296	GITTES	May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
L129847	u4476	m296	EVELYN	What do you mean?
L129846	u4477	m296	GITTES	You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
L129845	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
L129844	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
L129843	u4477	m296	GITTES	I should talk this over with your husband.
L129842	u4477	m296	GITTES	I don't want to drop it.
L129841	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes, Mr. Gittes?
L129840	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mrs. Mulwray?
L129839	u4476	m296	EVELYN	So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
L129838	u4476	m296	EVELYN	I said I'll drop it.
L129837	u4477	m296	GITTES	What?
L129836	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
L129835	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
L129834	u4477	m296	GITTES	Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
L129833	u4476	m296	EVELYN	That's not his apartment.
L129832	u4477	m296	GITTES	Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
L129831	u4476	m296	EVELYN	My husband's at the office.
L129830	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah. Fine, thank you.
L129829	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Iced tea.
L129828	u4477	m296	GITTES	What are you having?
L129827	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Would you like something to drink?
L129773	u4477	m296	GITTES	Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
L129772	u4476	m296	EVELYN	Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
L129771	u4477	m296	GITTES	Not that Mulwray?
L129789	u4477	m296	GITTES	Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me ? so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
L129788	u4486	m296	SOPHIE	Yes, Mr. Gittes.
L129787	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sophie.
L129757	u4486	m296	SOPHIE	Yes, Mr. Gittes.
L129756	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sophie.
L129755	u4486	m296	SOPHIE	But, Mr. Gittes.
L129754	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
L129706	u4486	m296	SOPHIE	He's in the dark room.
L129705	u4477	m296	GITTES	Walsh here?
L130642	u4491	m296	WALSH'S VOICE	Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
L130641	u4477	m296	GITTES	Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
L129714	u4491	m296	WALSH'S VOICE	It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
L129713	u4477	m296	GITTES	Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
L129712	u4491	m296	WALSH'S VOICE	I think I got something.
L129711	u4477	m296	GITTES	Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
L129710	u4491	m296	WALSH'S VOICE	What'd you expect? That's his job.
L129709	u4477	m296	GITTES	Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
L129708	u4491	m296	WALSH'S VOICE	Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
L129707	u4477	m296	GITTES	Where'd he go yesterday?
L130006	u4477	m296	GITTES	'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
L130005	u4478	m296	IDA'S VOICE	You'll find one of those people.
L130004	u4477	m296	GITTES	The obituary column?
L130003	u4478	m296	IDA'S VOICE	No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
L130002	u4477	m296	GITTES	...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
L130001	u4478	m296	IDA'S VOICE	Oh no.
L130000	u4477	m296	GITTES	I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
L129999	u4478	m296	IDA'S VOICE	Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
L129998	u4477	m296	GITTES	Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
L129997	u4478	m296	IDA'S VOICE	I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
L129996	u4477	m296	GITTES	When did you come in?
L129995	u4478	m296	IDA'S VOICE	Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
L129994	u4477	m296	GITTES	Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
L129993	u4478	m296	IDA'S VOICE	Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
L129992	u4477	m296	GITTES	Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
L129991	u4477	m296	GITTES	Okay.
L129990	u4487	m296	SOPHIE'S VOICE	Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
L129981	u4477	m296	GITTES	Don't know her. Take a number.
L129980	u4487	m296	SOPHIE'S VOICE	Ida Sessions.
L129979	u4477	m296	GITTES	Who?
L129978	u4487	m296	SOPHIE'S VOICE	A Miss Sessions calling.
L129977	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah, Sophie.
L130352	u4477	m296	GITTES	We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
L130351	u4482	m296	PALMER	Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
L130350	u4477	m296	GITTES	Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
L130349	u4482	m296	PALMER	I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
L130348	u4477	m296	GITTES	I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
L130347	u4482	m296	PALMER	Oh, good.
L130346	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
L130345	u4482	m296	PALMER	We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
L130344	u4477	m296	GITTES	Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
L130343	u4477	m296	GITTES	Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
L130342	u4482	m296	PALMER	I'm sorry. We don't.
L130341	u4477	m296	GITTES	Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
L130340	u4482	m296	PALMER	Of course.
L130339	u4477	m296	GITTES	There's just one question.
L130338	u4482	m296	PALMER	Perhaps if we could meet your father.
L130337	u4477	m296	GITTES	Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
L130334	u4477	m296	GITTES	Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
L130333	u4482	m296	PALMER	Oh my goodness.
L130123	u4477	m296	GITTES	I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
L130122	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Yes...
L130121	u4477	m296	GITTES	Hard working, have a wife and kids...
L130120	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Yes...
L130119	u4477	m296	GITTES	You're a married man, am I right?
L130118	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
L130117	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's like saying they're in Arizona.
L130116	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	I said, the northwest valley.
L130115	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
L130114	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
L130113	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
L130112	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
L130111	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
L130110	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
L130109	u4477	m296	GITTES	Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
L130108	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	I don't understand.
L130107	u4477	m296	GITTES	I never was.
L130106	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
L130105	u4477	m296	GITTES	Only when I breathe.
L130104	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
L130103	u4477	m296	GITTES	I cut myself shaving.
L130102	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
L130101	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
L130100	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
L129819	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Hope so. He's working for us.
L129818	u4477	m296	GITTES	Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
L129814	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Help yourself.
L129813	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
L129812	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, tell him I'll be back.
L129811	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	I'm sorry, I --
L129810	u4477	m296	GITTES	You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
L129809	u4477	m296	GITTES	Maybe he takes it very seriously.
L129808	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	He never even kids about it.
L129807	u4477	m296	GITTES	And Mulwray isn't?
L129806	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
L129804	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
L129803	u4477	m296	GITTES	J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
L129802	u4492	m296	YELBURTON	Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
L129770	u4493	m296	YOUNG WOMAN	That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife.
L129769	u4477	m296	GITTES	Never.
L129768	u4493	m296	YOUNG WOMAN	Never?
L129767	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, no.
L129766	u4493	m296	YOUNG WOMAN	Have we ever met?
L129765	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
L129764	u4493	m296	YOUNG WOMAN	Do you know me?
L129763	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yes?
L129762	u4493	m296	YOUNG WOMAN	Mr. Gittes?
L129969	u4488	m296	THE BOY	Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
L129968	u4477	m296	GITTES	When it comes? What'd you tell him?
L129967	u4488	m296	THE BOY	When it comes.
L129966	u4477	m296	GITTES	What about the water?
L129965	u4488	m296	THE BOY	The water.
L129963	u4477	m296	GITTES	Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
L129962	u4488	m296	THE BOY	Si.
L129961	u4477	m296	GITTES	Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
L129957	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
L129956	u4479	m296	MORTY	It's not completely dry.
L129955	u4477	m296	GITTES	It's bone dry, Morty.
L129954	u4479	m296	MORTY	Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
L129953	u4477	m296	GITTES	The L.A. River?
L129952	u4479	m296	MORTY	Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
L129951	u4477	m296	GITTES	Come again?
L129950	u4479	m296	MORTY	Drowned, too.
L129949	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah.
L129944	u4477	m296	GITTES	So how are you, Morty?
L129943	u4479	m296	MORTY	That's a long fall.
L129942	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
L129941	u4479	m296	MORTY	Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
L129940	u4477	m296	GITTES	Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
L129939	u4479	m296	MORTY	Jake, what're you doin' here?
L130496	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
L130495	u4489	m296	VOICE ON PHONE	Sure you do.
L130494	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah?... I do?
L130492	u4477	m296	GITTES	Who?
L130491	u4489	m296	VOICE ON PHONE	Ida Sessions wants to see you.
L130490	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah.
L130489	u4489	m296	VOICE ON PHONE	Gittes?... Gittes?
L129694	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
L129693	u4477	m296	GITTES	This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
L129690	u4477	m296	GITTES	Water and Power?
L129689	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
L129688	u4477	m296	GITTES	All right, what's your husband's first name?
L129687	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	But I have to know.
L129686	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
L129685	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	But...
L129684	u4477	m296	GITTES	Then go home and forget about it.
L129683	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	...Yes of course.
L129682	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
L129680	u4477	m296	GITTES	Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
L129679	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	Of course not.
L129678	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
L129677	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
L129676	u4477	m296	GITTES	I am sorry.
L129675	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	I'm afraid so.
L129674	u4477	m296	GITTES	No, really?
L129672	u4477	m296	GITTES	Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
L129671	u4480	m296	MRS. MULWRAY	Mr. Gittes...
L129670	u4477	m296	GITTES	How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
L130286	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah, I'll do that.
L130285	u4484	m296	RAINMAKER	Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
L130284	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah.
L130283	u4484	m296	RAINMAKER	Never heard of 'em... new owners?
L130282	u4477	m296	GITTES	That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
L130281	u4484	m296	RAINMAKER	City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
L130280	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah.  Do you have any references?
L130279	u4484	m296	RAINMAKER	No problem with me on the Job.
L130098	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Yes. Yes, they were partners.
L130097	u4477	m296	GITTES	They were partners.
L130096	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Along with Mr. Mulwray.
L130095	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
L130094	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
L130093	u4477	m296	GITTES	How did they get it away from him?
L130092	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Yes.
L130091	u4477	m296	GITTES	He owned the entire water supply for the city?
L130090	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Yes.
L130089	u4477	m296	GITTES	He owned the water department?
L130088	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	He owned it.
L130087	u4477	m296	GITTES	He did or he didn't?
L130086	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Yes. No.
L130085	u4477	m296	GITTES	Julian Cross worked for the water department?
L130083	u4477	m296	GITTES	I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
L130082	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
L130081	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
L130080	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
L129801	u4477	m296	GITTES	Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
L129800	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	He was expecting you?
L129799	u4477	m296	GITTES	Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
L129798	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	Since lunch.
L129797	u4477	m296	GITTES	It's personal. Has he been out long?
L129796	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	May I ask what this is regarding?
L129795	u4477	m296	GITTES	Gittes.
L129794	u4485	m296	SECRETARY	He's not in, Mr.?
L129793	u4477	m296	GITTES	Mr. Mulwray, please.
L130748	u4477	m296	GITTES	Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
L130747	u4490	m296	WALSH	Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
L130746	u4477	m296	GITTES	Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
L129989	u4490	m296	WALSH	Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
L129988	u4477	m296	GITTES	Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
L129987	u4490	m296	WALSH	Yeah?
L129984	u4477	m296	GITTES	I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
L129983	u4490	m296	WALSH	Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
L129792	u4477	m296	GITTES	They're all a bunch of phonies.
L129791	u4490	m296	WALSH	So he says you sent them?
L129786	u4477	m296	GITTES	When I find out who that phony bitch was.
L129785	u4490	m296	WALSH	No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
L129784	u4477	m296	GITTES	All she needed for that was the phone book!
L129783	u4490	m296	WALSH	Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
L129725	u4477	m296	GITTES	Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
L129724	u4490	m296	WALSH	Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
L129723	u4477	m296	GITTES	Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
L129722	u4490	m296	WALSH	Yeah.
L129721	u4477	m296	GITTES	Apple core?
L129720	u4490	m296	WALSH	I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing ? apple core.
L129719	u4477	m296	GITTES	What about?
L129718	u4490	m296	WALSH	They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
L129717	u4477	m296	GITTES	This?
L129742	u4481	m296	OTHER CUSTOMER	No, you have a press agent do it.
L129741	u4477	m296	GITTES	Neither do I.
L129740	u4481	m296	OTHER CUSTOMER	We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
L129739	u4477	m296	GITTES	Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
L129738	u4481	m296	OTHER CUSTOMER	Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
L129737	u4477	m296	GITTES	Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
L129736	u4481	m296	OTHER CUSTOMER	Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
L129735	u4477	m296	GITTES	What's that, pal?
L130175	u4483	m296	PILOT	Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
L130174	u4477	m296	GITTES	You don't say?
L130173	u4483	m296	PILOT	She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
L130172	u4477	m296	GITTES	We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
L130171	u4483	m296	PILOT	Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
L130170	u4477	m296	GITTES	Why'd she run away?
L130169	u4483	m296	PILOT	That's for sure.
L130168	u4477	m296	GITTES	Well, you never know, do you?
L130167	u4483	m296	PILOT	Course, she settled down nicely.
L130166	u4483	m296	PILOT	Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
L130165	u4477	m296	GITTES	She ran away?
L130164	u4483	m296	PILOT	No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
L130163	u4477	m296	GITTES	You must be thinking of a different daughter.
L130162	u4483	m296	PILOT	She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
L130161	u4477	m296	GITTES	She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
L130160	u4483	m296	PILOT	That right?... She used to be some looker.
L130159	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'm working for his daughter.
L130158	u4483	m296	PILOT	Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
L130157	u4477	m296	GITTES	I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
L130156	u4483	m296	PILOT	Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
L130155	u4483	m296	PILOT	But that's what you told your wife.
L130154	u4477	m296	GITTES	Not exactly.
L133880	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
L133879	u4505	m298	KANE	Please, Mr. Bernstein.
L133878	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
L133877	u4505	m298	KANE	You don't really think so?
L133876	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
L133650	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
L133649	u4505	m298	KANE	We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
L133648	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
L133647	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
L133646	u4505	m298	KANE	Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
L133638	u4505	m298	KANE	I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
L133637	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
L133627	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
L133626	u4505	m298	KANE	"Gentlemen of the ""Enquirer""!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the ""Enquirer's"" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark."
L133623	u4505	m298	KANE	I know.
L133622	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	"You know how long it took the ""Chronicle"" to get that staff together?  Twenty years."
L133621	u4505	m298	KANE	You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
L133620	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
L133617	u4505	m298	KANE	Look at that.
L133616	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
L133615	u4505	m298	KANE	Let's hope they like it there.
L133607	u4505	m298	KANE	These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
L133606	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
L133605	u4505	m298	KANE	I'll write it myself.
L133604	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
L133603	u4505	m298	KANE	My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
L133578	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Oh!
L133577	u4505	m298	KANE	It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
L133574	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
L133573	u4505	m298	KANE	Ready for dinner, Brad?
L133572	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
L133571	u4505	m298	KANE	Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
L133570	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	This is all figured at three cents a copy.
L133569	u4505	m298	KANE	Two cents.
L133568	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Three cents.
L133563	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
L133562	u4505	m298	KANE	"I've just made a shocking discovery. The ""Enquirer"" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!"
L133527	u4505	m298	KANE	Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
L133526	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	I can't take shorthand.
L133525	u4505	m298	KANE	It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
L133524	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	I didn't see that.
L133523	u4505	m298	KANE	Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
L133522	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	That's all there is.
L133521	u4505	m298	KANE	Go on!
L133520	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to... 
L133519	u4505	m298	KANE	Thais.
L133518	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
L133516	u4505	m298	KANE	What does it say there?
L133515	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
L133513	u4505	m298	KANE	That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
L133512	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Kane -
L133510	u4505	m298	KANE	Where is he?
L133509	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	He sure did, Mr. Kane.
L133432	u4505	m298	KANE	I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
L133431	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	That's fine, Mr. Kane.
L133426	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
L133425	u4505	m298	KANE	That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
L133422	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
L133421	u4505	m298	KANE	Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
L133490	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Well, well - isn't that nice?
L133489	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Yes, very!  Naturally.
L133488	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Enthusiastic?
L133487	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
L133486	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
L133485	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
L133482	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	That's a long story.
L133481	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
L133480	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	"That's right.  They called us the ""Three Musketeers."""
L133479	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
L133478	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	I might make him nervous.
L133477	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
L133476	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Go in and ask him to hurry.
L133670	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
L133669	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
L133668	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
L133667	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
L133666	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
L133665	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Yes -
L133664	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
L133663	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	It didn't end very well, did it?
L133662	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
L133532	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
L133531	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
L133530	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
L133529	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
L133528	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
L133471	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
L133470	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	He made an awful lot of money.
L133469	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
L133468	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
L133467	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Who else did you see?
L133466	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I'm going back there.
L133465	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Sure, sure.
L133464	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	You know why?  She was so -
L133463	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
L133462	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
L133461	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Who else you been to see?
L133460	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
L133459	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	"You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this ""Rosebud,"" Mr. Thompson."
L133458	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
L133457	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
L133456	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
L133455	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
L133454	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
L133453	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
L133993	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
L133992	u4507	m298	LELAND	I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
L133991	u4507	m298	LELAND	Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
L133990	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Kane is finishing it.
L133989	u4507	m298	LELAND	Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
L133988	u4507	m298	LELAND	Hello, Bernstein.
L133987	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Hello, Mr. Leland.
L133795	u4507	m298	LELAND	Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
L133794	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
L133793	u4507	m298	LELAND	Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
L133792	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
L133789	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
L133788	u4507	m298	LELAND	What's happened?
L133732	u4507	m298	LELAND	September the ninth?
L133731	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
L133728	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
L133727	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Yes.
L133726	u4507	m298	LELAND	Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
L133725	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Don't I always?  Most of the time?
L133724	u4507	m298	LELAND	Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
L133723	u4507	m298	LELAND	I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
L133722	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
L133721	u4507	m298	LELAND	Certainly not.
L133720	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Do you, Mr. Leland?
L133688	u4507	m298	LELAND	Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
L133687	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
L133686	u4507	m298	LELAND	"Do we stand for the same things that the ""Chronicle"" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?"
L133684	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
L133683	u4507	m298	LELAND	"Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the ""Enquirer"" - who were with the ""Chronicle"" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the ""Chronicle"" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?"
L133682	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	What's the matter?
L133680	u4507	m298	LELAND	Yes.
L133679	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
L133645	u4507	m298	LELAND	Certainly not.
L133644	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Do you, Mr. Leland?
L133614	u4507	m298	LELAND	That looks pretty nice.
L133613	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Sixty-two thousand -
L133600	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -
L133599	u4507	m298	LELAND	Charlie?!
L133598	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Wasted?
L133594	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
L133593	u4507	m298	LELAND	We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
L133576	u4500	m298	BERNSTEIN	Who said anything about brooms?
L133575	u4507	m298	LELAND	I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
L133586	u4501	m298	CARTER	But Mr. Kane, I meant -
L133585	u4505	m298	KANE	It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
L133584	u4501	m298	CARTER	I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
L133565	u4505	m298	KANE	That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
L133564	u4501	m298	CARTER	But, Mr. Kane -
L133560	u4501	m298	CARTER	Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
L133559	u4505	m298	KANE	"That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the ""Enquirer"" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear."
L133558	u4501	m298	CARTER	It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
L133557	u4505	m298	KANE	"The ""Chronicle"" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious."
L133556	u4501	m298	CARTER	"As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the ""Chronicle"" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead."
L133555	u4505	m298	KANE	If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
L133554	u4501	m298	CARTER	There is no news big enough.
L133553	u4505	m298	KANE	"I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The ""Chronicle"" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?"
L133552	u4501	m298	CARTER	Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
L133551	u4505	m298	KANE	"I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the ""Chronicle,""  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the ""Enquirer"" have that this morning?"
L133550	u4505	m298	KANE	That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
L133549	u4501	m298	CARTER	But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
L133548	u4505	m298	KANE	I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
L133547	u4501	m298	CARTER	My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
L133546	u4505	m298	KANE	You've got a private office here, haven't you?
L133545	u4501	m298	CARTER	How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
L133544	u4505	m298	KANE	Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
L133540	u4505	m298	KANE	I don't my plans myself.
L133539	u4501	m298	CARTER	You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
L133538	u4505	m298	KANE	Ask them to sit down.
L133537	u4501	m298	CARTER	I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
L133536	u4505	m298	KANE	Are they standing for me?
L133535	u4501	m298	CARTER	How do you do, Mr. Leland?
L133534	u4505	m298	KANE	Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
L133533	u4501	m298	CARTER	"Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the ""Enquirer."" I am Herbert Carter."
L133508	u4505	m298	KANE	He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
L133507	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	We haven't heard from him.
L133506	u4505	m298	KANE	Has he said when he'll finish?
L133505	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Yes, Mr. Kane.
L133504	u4505	m298	KANE	That's Leland, isn't it?
L133503	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	No, Mr. Kane.
L133502	u4505	m298	KANE	It isn't finished?
L133501	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
L133500	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Yes, Mr. kane.
L133499	u4505	m298	KANE	Is it good?
L133498	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Yes - Mr. Kane.
L133497	u4505	m298	KANE	And the notice?
L133496	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
L133495	u4505	m298	KANE	Was the show covered by every department?
L133494	u4505	m298	KANE	We've got a nice plant here.
L133493	u4502	m298	CITY EDITOR	Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
L134120	u4505	m298	KANE	Of course.
L134119	u4503	m298	DR. COREY	Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
L134118	u4505	m298	KANE	There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
L134117	u4503	m298	DR. COREY	I'm sure that's it. 
L134116	u4505	m298	KANE	Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
L134115	u4503	m298	DR. COREY	The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
L133932	u4514	m298	ROGERS	I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
L133931	u4504	m298	EMILY	You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
L133926	u4514	m298	ROGERS	The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
L133925	u4504	m298	EMILY	What story, Mr. Rogers?
L133921	u4504	m298	EMILY	I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 
L133920	u4514	m298	ROGERS	I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
L133919	u4504	m298	EMILY	Let him finish, Charles.
L133909	u4504	m298	EMILY	Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
L133908	u4514	m298	ROGERS	Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
L133905	u4514	m298	ROGERS	I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
L133904	u4504	m298	EMILY	How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
L133986	u4504	m298	EMILY	If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
L133985	u4507	m298	LELAND	He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
L133984	u4504	m298	EMILY	I know it is, Brad -
L133983	u4507	m298	LELAND	It's - all over -
L133982	u4504	m298	EMILY	Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
L133981	u4507	m298	LELAND	Emily, you -
L133980	u4504	m298	EMILY	Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
L133979	u4507	m298	LELAND	I know that, Emily -
L133978	u4504	m298	EMILY	There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
L133977	u4507	m298	LELAND	Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
L133976	u4504	m298	EMILY	Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
L133975	u4507	m298	LELAND	Emily!
L133974	u4504	m298	EMILY	I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
L133973	u4507	m298	LELAND	Almost two to one -
L133969	u4507	m298	LELAND	Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
L133968	u4504	m298	EMILY	I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
L133967	u4507	m298	LELAND	Emily -
L133966	u4504	m298	EMILY	Hello, Brad -
L133956	u4505	m298	KANE	Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
L133955	u4504	m298	EMILY	Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
L133949	u4505	m298	KANE	Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone!
L133948	u4504	m298	EMILY	You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
L133947	u4505	m298	KANE	There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
L133946	u4505	m298	KANE	No.
L133945	u4504	m298	EMILY	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
L133944	u4505	m298	KANE	Oh yes, there is.
L133941	u4504	m298	EMILY	I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
L133940	u4505	m298	KANE	I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
L133939	u4504	m298	EMILY	Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
L133938	u4505	m298	KANE	Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
L133937	u4504	m298	EMILY	I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
L133936	u4505	m298	KANE	You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
L133916	u4505	m298	KANE	You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
L133915	u4504	m298	EMILY	Oh!!
L133897	u4504	m298	EMILY	I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
L133896	u4505	m298	KANE	I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
L133895	u4504	m298	EMILY	I intend to find out.
L133893	u4504	m298	EMILY	It may not be about anything at all.
L133892	u4505	m298	KANE	What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
L133890	u4504	m298	EMILY	No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
L133889	u4505	m298	KANE	It can wait.
L133888	u4504	m298	EMILY	There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
L133887	u4505	m298	KANE	But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
L133886	u4504	m298	EMILY	I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
L133857	u4504	m298	EMILY	They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
L133856	u4505	m298	KANE	Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
L133855	u4504	m298	EMILY	Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
L133854	u4505	m298	KANE	I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
L133853	u4504	m298	EMILY	Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
L133852	u4504	m298	EMILY	Please don't talk any more, Charles.
L133851	u4505	m298	KANE	They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
L133849	u4504	m298	EMILY	Charles.
L133848	u4505	m298	KANE	What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
L134187	u4505	m298	KANE	Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
L134186	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
L134185	u4505	m298	KANE	Don't go, Susan.
L134184	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Goodbye, Charlie.
L134183	u4515	m298	SUSAN	You can't stop me.
L134182	u4505	m298	KANE	I won't let you go.
L134181	u4515	m298	SUSAN	- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
L134180	u4505	m298	KANE	Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
L134172	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Yes.
L134171	u4505	m298	KANE	No, you're not.
L134170	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I'm going to leave you.
L134169	u4505	m298	KANE	I'm not sorry.
L134168	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Don't tell me you're sorry.
L134167	u4505	m298	KANE	Susan, it seems to me -
L134166	u4515	m298	SUSAN	You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
L134164	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
L134163	u4505	m298	KANE	You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
L134162	u4505	m298	KANE	Susan!
L134161	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
L134160	u4505	m298	KANE	Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
L134159	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
L134158	u4505	m298	KANE	Susan, I really think -
L134157	u4515	m298	SUSAN	What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
L134156	u4505	m298	KANE	As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
L134155	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
L134154	u4505	m298	KANE	We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
L134153	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
L134152	u4505	m298	KANE	You're my wife, Susan, and -
L134151	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
L134150	u4505	m298	KANE	I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
L134149	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
L134148	u4505	m298	KANE	You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
L134147	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
L134141	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
L134140	u4505	m298	KANE	I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
L134139	u4515	m298	SUSAN	It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
L134138	u4505	m298	KANE	You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
L134137	u4515	m298	SUSAN	It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
L134133	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Can't we go back, Charlie?
L134132	u4505	m298	KANE	You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
L134131	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
L134130	u4505	m298	KANE	Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
L134129	u4515	m298	SUSAN	At night?
L134128	u4505	m298	KANE	Half past eleven.
L134127	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I mean in New York.
L134126	u4505	m298	KANE	Half past eleven.
L134125	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
L134122	u4505	m298	KANE	That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
L134121	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
L134088	u4505	m298	KANE	Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
L134087	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh, no, that's all gone.
L134086	u4505	m298	KANE	Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
L134085	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Well, I -
L134084	u4505	m298	KANE	Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
L134083	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
L134082	u4505	m298	KANE	Would you sing for me?
L134081	u4515	m298	SUSAN	As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
L134080	u4505	m298	KANE	Yes -
L134079	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
L134078	u4505	m298	KANE	What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
L134077	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
L134076	u4505	m298	KANE	Is that what you want to do?
L134075	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I work at Seligman's.
L134074	u4505	m298	KANE	That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
L134073	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
L134072	u4505	m298	KANE	I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
L134071	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I didn't say.
L134070	u4505	m298	KANE	How old did you say you were?
L134069	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh, me -
L134068	u4505	m298	KANE	Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
L134066	u4505	m298	KANE	I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
L134065	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
L134064	u4505	m298	KANE	And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
L134063	u4515	m298	SUSAN	You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
L134062	u4505	m298	KANE	But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
L134061	u4515	m298	SUSAN	No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
L134060	u4505	m298	KANE	You really don't know who I am?
L134059	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
L134058	u4505	m298	KANE	You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
L134057	u4515	m298	SUSAN	A rooster?
L134056	u4505	m298	KANE	No.  But you're close.
L134055	u4515	m298	SUSAN	A chicken?
L134048	u4505	m298	KANE	I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
L134047	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
L134046	u4505	m298	KANE	Thanks.
L134045	u4515	m298	SUSAN	On the chiffonier.  Here.
L134044	u4505	m298	KANE	Where's the towel?
L134043	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I know...  But you do look so silly.
L134042	u4505	m298	KANE	I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
L134041	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh!
L134040	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
L134039	u4505	m298	KANE	You're very easily amused.
L134038	u4515	m298	SUSAN	In the water.
L134037	u4505	m298	KANE	Where's the soap?
L134036	u4515	m298	SUSAN	No.  They've passed on.
L134035	u4505	m298	KANE	I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
L134034	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
L134032	u4505	m298	KANE	Thanks.
L134031	u4515	m298	SUSAN	If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
L134030	u4505	m298	KANE	You're no Venus de Milo.
L134029	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Oh!
L134028	u4515	m298	SUSAN	You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
L134027	u4505	m298	KANE	What's funny now?
L134026	u4505	m298	KANE	If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
L134025	u4515	m298	SUSAN	You've got some on your face.
L134024	u4505	m298	KANE	Hmm!
L134023	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Toothache.
L134022	u4505	m298	KANE	What's the matter with you?
L134021	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Ow!
L133961	u4505	m298	KANE	What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
L133960	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Charlie, please don't -
L133959	u4505	m298	KANE	Get out, both of you!
L133954	u4505	m298	KANE	I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
L133953	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
L133923	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
L133922	u4505	m298	KANE	You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
L133907	u4505	m298	KANE	Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
L133906	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
L133964	u4505	m298	KANE	Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
L133963	u4514	m298	ROGERS	You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
L133952	u4514	m298	ROGERS	I see! 
L133951	u4505	m298	KANE	Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
L133950	u4514	m298	ROGERS	You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
L133930	u4514	m298	ROGERS	Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
L133929	u4505	m298	KANE	You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
L133918	u4505	m298	KANE	I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
L133917	u4514	m298	ROGERS	Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
L133914	u4514	m298	ROGERS	I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
L133913	u4505	m298	KANE	In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
L133912	u4514	m298	ROGERS	She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
L133752	u4518	m298	THE PRESIDENT	You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
L133751	u4505	m298	KANE	I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
L133750	u4518	m298	THE PRESIDENT	I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
L133749	u4505	m298	KANE	Thanks.
L133748	u4518	m298	THE PRESIDENT	I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
L133747	u4505	m298	KANE	It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
L133746	u4518	m298	THE PRESIDENT	I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
L133745	u4505	m298	KANE	I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
L133744	u4518	m298	THE PRESIDENT	It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
L134102	u4505	m298	KANE	You can't.
L134101	u4508	m298	MATISTI	Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
L134100	u4505	m298	KANE	If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
L134099	u4508	m298	MATISTI	But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
L134098	u4505	m298	KANE	Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
L134097	u4508	m298	MATISTI	Impossible!  Impossible!
L133447	u4505	m298	KANE	You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
L133446	u4516	m298	THATCHER	I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
L133443	u4505	m298	KANE	On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
L133442	u4516	m298	THATCHER	Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
L133440	u4505	m298	KANE	The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
L133439	u4516	m298	THATCHER	They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
L133438	u4505	m298	KANE	Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
L133436	u4505	m298	KANE	Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
L133435	u4516	m298	THATCHER	I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
L133428	u4505	m298	KANE	I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
L133427	u4516	m298	THATCHER	You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
L133420	u4505	m298	KANE	Can you prove it isn't?
L133419	u4516	m298	THATCHER	Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast.  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
L133418	u4505	m298	KANE	I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
L133417	u4516	m298	THATCHER	Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
L133399	u4505	m298	KANE	Where'm I going?
L133398	u4516	m298	THATCHER	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
L133397	u4505	m298	KANE	You goin', Mom?
L134229	u4505	m298	KANE	I didn't used to be afraid of it.
L134228	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
L134227	u4505	m298	KANE	He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
L134226	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
L134225	u4505	m298	KANE	Persia.  It belonged to a king.
L134224	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
L134223	u4505	m298	KANE	Do you know what that is?
L134222	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Oh, yes, sir.
L134221	u4505	m298	KANE	Not my wife - not either of them.
L134220	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Yes, Mr. Kane.
L134219	u4505	m298	KANE	Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
L134218	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Can't say, sir.
L134217	u4505	m298	KANE	Do you like poetry, Raymond?
L134212	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Yes, sir -
L134211	u4505	m298	KANE	Raymond - 
L134210	u4505	m298	KANE	Lock it - and keep it locked.
L134209	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Yes, sir. 
L134208	u4505	m298	KANE	Close the door, Raymond.
L134176	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
L134175	u4505	m298	KANE	Is Mrs. Kane - 
L134174	u4505	m298	KANE	All right.
L134173	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
L134113	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Yes, sir.
L134112	u4505	m298	KANE	Get Dr. Corey.
L133996	u4507	m298	LELAND	Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
L133995	u4505	m298	KANE	Hello, Brad.
L133842	u4507	m298	LELAND	I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
L133841	u4505	m298	KANE	Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
L133840	u4507	m298	LELAND	Yes.
L133839	u4505	m298	KANE	You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
L133834	u4505	m298	KANE	Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
L133833	u4507	m298	LELAND	I know you will.
L133832	u4505	m298	KANE	She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
L133831	u4505	m298	KANE	It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
L133830	u4507	m298	LELAND	You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
L133829	u4505	m298	KANE	Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
L133828	u4507	m298	LELAND	That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
L133827	u4505	m298	KANE	You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
L133826	u4507	m298	LELAND	Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
L133825	u4505	m298	KANE	Are you finished?
L133824	u4507	m298	LELAND	You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
L133823	u4507	m298	LELAND	You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
L133822	u4505	m298	KANE	The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
L133821	u4507	m298	LELAND	There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
L133819	u4507	m298	LELAND	You might have made the whole thing less personal!
L133818	u4505	m298	KANE	"Do you think the ""Enquirer"" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?"
L133817	u4507	m298	LELAND	She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
L133816	u4505	m298	KANE	Why is she leaving me?
L133815	u4507	m298	LELAND	Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
L133814	u4505	m298	KANE	Brad, you are drunk.
L133813	u4507	m298	LELAND	Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
L133812	u4507	m298	LELAND	She was going to leave you anyway -
L133811	u4505	m298	KANE	I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
L133810	u4507	m298	LELAND	She's going to leave you -
L133809	u4505	m298	KANE	All right.
L133808	u4507	m298	LELAND	No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
L133807	u4505	m298	KANE	I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
L133806	u4507	m298	LELAND	I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
L133805	u4505	m298	KANE	Why, Brad?
L133804	u4507	m298	LELAND	Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
L133802	u4505	m298	KANE	That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
L133801	u4507	m298	LELAND	"First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the ""Enquirer."""
L133800	u4505	m298	KANE	I'll get you some coffee.
L133799	u4507	m298	LELAND	I'm drunk.
L133798	u4505	m298	KANE	What's wrong, Brad?
L133797	u4507	m298	LELAND	First of all - 
L133786	u4505	m298	KANE	Go ahead.
L133785	u4507	m298	LELAND	I'd like to talk to you about that.
L133784	u4505	m298	KANE	I've got to think of Emily -
L133783	u4507	m298	LELAND	What?
L133782	u4505	m298	KANE	I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
L133781	u4507	m298	LELAND	Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
L133780	u4505	m298	KANE	"What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - ""This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"""
L133779	u4507	m298	LELAND	There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
L133778	u4507	m298	LELAND	Look out that window.
L133777	u4505	m298	KANE	Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
L133776	u4507	m298	LELAND	Charlie!
L133775	u4505	m298	KANE	They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
L133774	u4507	m298	LELAND	You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
L133773	u4505	m298	KANE	I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
L133772	u4507	m298	LELAND	"- and that copy of the ""Enquirer"" said the President should be killed."
L133771	u4505	m298	KANE	"Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the ""Enquirer"" in his pocket?"
L133770	u4507	m298	LELAND	Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
L133769	u4505	m298	KANE	What do you mean by that?
L133764	u4507	m298	LELAND	Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
L133763	u4505	m298	KANE	Why not?
L133762	u4507	m298	LELAND	Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
L133761	u4505	m298	KANE	Yes?
L133760	u4507	m298	LELAND	Charlie -
L133759	u4505	m298	KANE	"Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  ""This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"""
L133718	u4505	m298	KANE	You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
L133717	u4507	m298	LELAND	It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
L133716	u4505	m298	KANE	Yes?
L133715	u4507	m298	LELAND	Charlie -
L133714	u4505	m298	KANE	"You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in ""The Spring Chicken.""  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?"
L133713	u4507	m298	LELAND	I'd like that.
L133712	u4505	m298	KANE	You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
L133711	u4507	m298	LELAND	Good.
L133710	u4505	m298	KANE	I mean I've got a job for you.
L133709	u4507	m298	LELAND	Yes?
L133708	u4505	m298	KANE	Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
L133700	u4505	m298	KANE	And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
L133699	u4507	m298	LELAND	They do it only because you do!
L133698	u4505	m298	KANE	"How would the ""Enquirer"" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?"
L133697	u4507	m298	LELAND	Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
L133693	u4505	m298	KANE	All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
L133692	u4507	m298	LELAND	But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
L133691	u4505	m298	KANE	"It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the ""Hickville Gazette"" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the ""Enquirer's"" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -"
L133690	u4507	m298	LELAND	Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
L133689	u4505	m298	KANE	Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
L133619	u4505	m298	KANE	It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
L133618	u4507	m298	LELAND	"The ""Chronicle"" is a good newspaper."
L133609	u4505	m298	KANE	People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
L133608	u4507	m298	LELAND	"That's the second sentence you've started with ""I"" -"
L133602	u4507	m298	LELAND	What're you going to do, Charlie?
L133601	u4505	m298	KANE	"I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the ""New York Enquirer"" as important to New York as the gas in that light."
L133597	u4505	m298	KANE	A wasted day.
L133596	u4507	m298	LELAND	It's been a tough day.
L133595	u4505	m298	KANE	Tired?
L133567	u4505	m298	KANE	What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
L133566	u4507	m298	LELAND	Poor Mr. Carter!
L133875	u4505	m298	KANE	I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?
L133874	u4513	m298	REILLY	Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
L133873	u4505	m298	KANE	It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
L133863	u4513	m298	REILLY	It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
L133862	u4505	m298	KANE	Oh, yes, the bonus.
L133861	u4513	m298	REILLY	You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
L133860	u4505	m298	KANE	What check?
L133859	u4513	m298	REILLY	Mr. Leland sent back that check.
L133858	u4505	m298	KANE	We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
L133766	u4505	m298	KANE	What do you mean by that?
L133765	u4513	m298	REILLY	Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
L133414	u4506	m298	KANE SR.	Yes.
L133413	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	That's what you think, is it, Jim?
L133412	u4506	m298	KANE SR.	Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
L133405	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	You won't be lonely, Charles...
L133404	u4506	m298	KANE SR.	You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
L133396	u4506	m298	KANE SR.	That's the train with all the lights.
L133395	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
L133377	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
L133376	u4506	m298	KANE SR.	Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
L133363	u4506	m298	KANE SR.	If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
L133362	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
L133361	u4506	m298	KANE SR.	You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
L133360	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	I'll sign those papers -
L134006	u4507	m298	LELAND	Hey, Nurse!
L134005	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
L134004	u4507	m298	LELAND	On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
L134003	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Sure.
L134002	u4507	m298	LELAND	I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
L134001	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	That must have been love.
L134000	u4507	m298	LELAND	I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
L133999	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Yes.
L133998	u4507	m298	LELAND	Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
L133743	u4507	m298	LELAND	He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
L133742	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Was he in love?
L133741	u4507	m298	LELAND	Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
L133740	u4507	m298	LELAND	I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
L133739	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
L133738	u4507	m298	LELAND	Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
L133737	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Rawlston is my boss.
L133736	u4507	m298	LELAND	David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
L133735	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	It's a letter from her lawyers.
L133734	u4507	m298	LELAND	What's this?
L133677	u4507	m298	LELAND	I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
L133676	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Maybe you could remember something that -
L133675	u4507	m298	LELAND	Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
L133674	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Sorry, Mr. Leland.
L133673	u4507	m298	LELAND	You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
L133672	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Mr. Leland, you were -
L133391	u4516	m298	THATCHER	How do you do, Charles?
L133390	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
L133389	u4516	m298	THATCHER	Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
L133372	u4516	m298	THATCHER	Right here, Mrs. Kane.
L133371	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
L133370	u4516	m298	THATCHER	We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
L133369	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
L133367	u4516	m298	THATCHER	The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
L133366	u4509	m298	MRS. KANE	I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
L134269	u4510	m298	PHOTOGRAPHER	Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
L134268	u4519	m298	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
L134267	u4510	m298	PHOTOGRAPHER	Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
L134265	u4519	m298	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
L134264	u4510	m298	PHOTOGRAPHER	Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
L134257	u4510	m298	PHOTOGRAPHER	I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
L134256	u4519	m298	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
L134255	u4510	m298	PHOTOGRAPHER	Yeah, all in crates.
L133322	u4511	m298	RAWLSTON	Good!
L133321	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
L133320	u4511	m298	RAWLSTON	Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
L133319	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
L133318	u4511	m298	RAWLSTON	Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
L133317	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Yes, sir.
L133316	u4511	m298	RAWLSTON	Thompson!
L133302	u4511	m298	RAWLSTON	All we saw on that screen was a big American -
L133301	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I know, but -
L133300	u4511	m298	RAWLSTON	Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
L133299	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Yes, and maybe he didn't.
L134246	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
L134245	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	The banks are out of luck, eh?
L134244	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Millions - if anybody wants it.
L134243	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
L134237	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
L134236	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	You can go on asking questions if you want to.
L134235	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	"See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That ""Rosebud"" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said ""Rosebud"" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him."
L134234	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Well, thanks a lot.
L134233	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Yes and no.
L134232	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
L134231	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	That's the whole works, right up to date.
L134201	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
L134200	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Queer?
L134199	u4512	m298	RAYMOND	Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
L134197	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
L134196	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
L134195	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
L134194	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
L134193	u4515	m298	SUSAN	They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
L134192	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
L134191	u4515	m298	SUSAN	In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
L134096	u4515	m298	SUSAN	He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
L134095	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	What about that apartment?
L134094	u4515	m298	SUSAN	He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
L134093	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	He married you, didn't he?
L134092	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
L134091	u4515	m298	SUSAN	What do you mean?
L134090	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	What did you get?
L134089	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
L134016	u4515	m298	SUSAN	I had a toothache.
L134015	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	How did you meet him?
L134014	u4515	m298	SUSAN	You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
L134013	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
L134012	u4515	m298	SUSAN	How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
L133334	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
L133333	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
L133332	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
L133331	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Think again!
L133330	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
L133329	u4515	m298	SUSAN	Who told you you could sit down here?
L133344	u4517	m298	THE CAPTAIN	Rosebud?
L133343	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
L133342	u4517	m298	THE CAPTAIN	She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
L133341	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	She's plastered, isn't she?
L133337	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
L133336	u4517	m298	THE CAPTAIN	She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
L133328	u4520	m298	THOMPSON	I'll have a highball.
L133327	u4517	m298	THE CAPTAIN	Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
L141873	u4589	m303	COP	All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.
L141872	u4595	m303	LIZA	Any special reason?
L141871	u4589	m303	COP	The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
L141870	u4595	m303	LIZA	Who?
L141869	u4589	m303	COP	They said send you downstairs.
L141867	u4589	m303	COP	Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
L141866	u4595	m303	LIZA	What happened?
L141732	u4590	m303	CYNIC	Just drop me off.
L141731	u4592	m303	JERRY	Look, I'm sorry --
L141730	u4590	m303	CYNIC	Drop me off here!
L141729	u4592	m303	JERRY	I was only going one way.
L141728	u4590	m303	CYNIC	You turned up a one way street!
L141727	u4592	m303	JERRY	The guy came right at us!
L141726	u4590	m303	CYNIC	Are you crazy?!
L141725	u4592	m303	JERRY	I, uh, I have some problems.
L141724	u4590	m303	CYNIC	Why the hell not?
L141723	u4592	m303	JERRY	I never told her.
L141720	u4592	m303	JERRY	I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
L141719	u4590	m303	CYNIC	She must be some girl.
L141718	u4592	m303	JERRY	Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
L141717	u4590	m303	CYNIC	But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
L141716	u4592	m303	JERRY	Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
L141715	u4590	m303	CYNIC	Geronimo?
L141714	u4592	m303	JERRY	Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
L141713	u4592	m303	JERRY	I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
L141712	u4590	m303	CYNIC	Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
L141711	u4592	m303	JERRY	That's love.
L141710	u4590	m303	CYNIC	Excuse me?
L141709	u4592	m303	JERRY	The sound of love.
L142523	u4591	m303	FLIP	Shut the hell up.
L142522	u4592	m303	JERRY	Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
L141996	u4591	m303	FLIP	Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
L141995	u4592	m303	JERRY	Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
L141994	u4591	m303	FLIP	Saved you last night's, too.
L141993	u4592	m303	JERRY	Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
L141992	u4591	m303	FLIP	<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
L141743	u4592	m303	JERRY	I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
L141742	u4591	m303	FLIP	Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
L141741	u4592	m303	JERRY	You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
L141740	u4591	m303	FLIP	Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
L141739	u4592	m303	JERRY	Mississippi?
L141738	u4591	m303	FLIP	Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
L141737	u4592	m303	JERRY	Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
L141736	u4591	m303	FLIP	What're you thinking, Jerry?
L142504	u4592	m303	JERRY	Now she tells me.
L142503	u4595	m303	LIZA	I love you, too.
L142500	u4592	m303	JERRY	Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
L142499	u4595	m303	LIZA	You think it's a conspiracy?
L142498	u4592	m303	JERRY	They changed Franklin's portrait.
L142496	u4592	m303	JERRY	Top pocket...  Go on.
L142495	u4595	m303	LIZA	You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
L142494	u4592	m303	JERRY	I can't promise you anything.
L142493	u4595	m303	LIZA	Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
L142485	u4595	m303	LIZA	Don't do this.
L142484	u4592	m303	JERRY	It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
L142483	u4595	m303	LIZA	Geronimo is down.
L142480	u4592	m303	JERRY	Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  <u>Now</u>.
L142479	u4595	m303	LIZA	What about you?
L142478	u4592	m303	JERRY	Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
L142476	u4592	m303	JERRY	I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
L142475	u4595	m303	LIZA	How did you know?
L142454	u4595	m303	LIZA	Where are you?
L142453	u4592	m303	JERRY	Liza?
L142452	u4595	m303	LIZA	You knew just what I was there for.
L142451	u4592	m303	JERRY	Blue moon...
L142450	u4595	m303	LIZA	Without a love of my own.
L142449	u4592	m303	JERRY	Without a song in my heart.
L142448	u4595	m303	LIZA	You saw me standing alone ...
L142447	u4592	m303	JERRY	Blue moon...
L142446	u4595	m303	LIZA	Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
L142445	u4592	m303	JERRY	Blue moon... Blue moon...
L142371	u4592	m303	JERRY	It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
L142370	u4595	m303	LIZA	I'm sorry.
L142369	u4592	m303	JERRY	They'll trace it.
L142368	u4595	m303	LIZA	You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
L142367	u4592	m303	JERRY	You do?
L142366	u4595	m303	LIZA	I believe you.
L142364	u4592	m303	JERRY	Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
L142363	u4595	m303	LIZA	How'd you get the picture?
L142362	u4592	m303	JERRY	Because he believed me.
L142361	u4595	m303	LIZA	<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
L142360	u4595	m303	LIZA	Why not?
L142359	u4592	m303	JERRY	Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
L142358	u4595	m303	LIZA	Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
L142357	u4592	m303	JERRY	He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
L142356	u4595	m303	LIZA	Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
L142355	u4592	m303	JERRY	To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
L142354	u4595	m303	LIZA	Back where?
L142353	u4592	m303	JERRY	I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
L142352	u4595	m303	LIZA	Love at first sight?
L142351	u4592	m303	JERRY	Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
L142350	u4595	m303	LIZA	Then tell me what happened.
L142349	u4592	m303	JERRY	Yeah.  I know what it's like.
L142348	u4595	m303	LIZA	Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
L142347	u4592	m303	JERRY	No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
L142346	u4595	m303	LIZA	Did you kill my father?!
L142345	u4592	m303	JERRY	That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
L142344	u4595	m303	LIZA	At a horse show.
L142343	u4592	m303	JERRY	Where were you the day he died?
L142342	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't understand.
L142341	u4592	m303	JERRY	He gave it to me.
L142340	u4595	m303	LIZA	Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
L142339	u4595	m303	LIZA	Did you kill my father?
L142338	u4592	m303	JERRY	Is that what they told you?
L142337	u4595	m303	LIZA	Did you kill him?
L142336	u4592	m303	JERRY	Liza?
L142329	u4595	m303	LIZA	You go.  Send me a postcard.
L142328	u4592	m303	JERRY	How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
L142327	u4592	m303	JERRY	Come on.
L142326	u4595	m303	LIZA	My father's house.
L142319	u4592	m303	JERRY	Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
L142318	u4595	m303	LIZA	John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
L142317	u4592	m303	JERRY	How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
L142316	u4595	m303	LIZA	What about them?
L142311	u4595	m303	LIZA	What's in Connecticut?
L142310	u4592	m303	JERRY	Connecticut.
L142309	u4595	m303	LIZA	Where are we going, Jerry?
L142308	u4592	m303	JERRY	After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
L142306	u4592	m303	JERRY	This way.
L142305	u4595	m303	LIZA	Now what?
L142303	u4592	m303	JERRY	Not today.
L142302	u4595	m303	LIZA	We're going to Queens?
L142295	u4592	m303	JERRY	There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
L142294	u4595	m303	LIZA	What is it?
L142293	u4592	m303	JERRY	It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
L142292	u4595	m303	LIZA	No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
L142291	u4592	m303	JERRY	Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
L142290	u4595	m303	LIZA	Thanks.
L142289	u4592	m303	JERRY	You look great.
L142211	u4592	m303	JERRY	I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
L142210	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
L142209	u4592	m303	JERRY	I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
L142208	u4595	m303	LIZA	Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
L142206	u4592	m303	JERRY	It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
L142205	u4595	m303	LIZA	Now's not really the time to get into this --
L142204	u4592	m303	JERRY	Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
L142203	u4595	m303	LIZA	Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
L142202	u4592	m303	JERRY	You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
L142201	u4595	m303	LIZA	Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
L142200	u4592	m303	JERRY	Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
L142199	u4595	m303	LIZA	If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
L142198	u4592	m303	JERRY	What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
L142197	u4595	m303	LIZA	Jerry, I --
L142196	u4592	m303	JERRY	Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
L142195	u4595	m303	LIZA	I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
L142194	u4592	m303	JERRY	I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
L142193	u4595	m303	LIZA	Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
L142192	u4592	m303	JERRY	I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
L142191	u4595	m303	LIZA	What?
L142190	u4592	m303	JERRY	I don't know what to say.  I love you.
L142189	u4595	m303	LIZA	If that's what you want.  Yes.
L142188	u4592	m303	JERRY	You will?
L142187	u4595	m303	LIZA	Okay, I will.
L142186	u4592	m303	JERRY	They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
L142185	u4595	m303	LIZA	A water main broke.
L142184	u4592	m303	JERRY	Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
L142183	u4595	m303	LIZA	They're big details, Jerry.
L142182	u4592	m303	JERRY	I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
L142181	u4595	m303	LIZA	What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
L142180	u4592	m303	JERRY	Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
L142179	u4595	m303	LIZA	Where then?
L142178	u4592	m303	JERRY	Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
L142177	u4595	m303	LIZA	It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
L142176	u4592	m303	JERRY	Right here in Manhattan.
L142175	u4595	m303	LIZA	Murdered?
L142174	u4592	m303	JERRY	His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
L142173	u4595	m303	LIZA	Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
L142172	u4592	m303	JERRY	Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
L142171	u4595	m303	LIZA	And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
L142170	u4592	m303	JERRY	So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
L142169	u4595	m303	LIZA	Cold War's over, Jerry.
L142168	u4592	m303	JERRY	There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
L142167	u4595	m303	LIZA	Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
L142166	u4592	m303	JERRY	Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
L142165	u4595	m303	LIZA	Realized what?
L142164	u4592	m303	JERRY	Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
L142163	u4595	m303	LIZA	I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
L142162	u4592	m303	JERRY	Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
L142161	u4595	m303	LIZA	They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
L142160	u4592	m303	JERRY	You haven't been bothering them, have you?
L142159	u4595	m303	LIZA	Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
L142158	u4592	m303	JERRY	I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
L142157	u4595	m303	LIZA	Where'd you get your subscribers?
L142156	u4592	m303	JERRY	Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
L142155	u4595	m303	LIZA	What van?
L142154	u4592	m303	JERRY	Did you see the van back there?
L142098	u4595	m303	LIZA	Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
L142097	u4592	m303	JERRY	Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
L142095	u4595	m303	LIZA	You watch me, don't you?
L142094	u4592	m303	JERRY	You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
L142093	u4595	m303	LIZA	Not this again.
L142092	u4592	m303	JERRY	He's why you punish yourself.
L142091	u4595	m303	LIZA	He was murdered.
L142090	u4592	m303	JERRY	How'd he die?
L142089	u4595	m303	LIZA	Please put it down.
L142088	u4592	m303	JERRY	Is he dead?
L142087	u4595	m303	LIZA	That was him.
L142086	u4592	m303	JERRY	Is this your dad?
L142085	u4595	m303	LIZA	I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
L142083	u4595	m303	LIZA	How is it possible?
L142082	u4592	m303	JERRY	So what's the question?
L142081	u4595	m303	LIZA	It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
L142080	u4592	m303	JERRY	I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
L142079	u4595	m303	LIZA	It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
L142078	u4592	m303	JERRY	Shoot.
L142077	u4595	m303	LIZA	Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
L142076	u4592	m303	JERRY	You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
L142071	u4592	m303	JERRY	Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
L142070	u4595	m303	LIZA	Who are you, Jerry?
L142069	u4592	m303	JERRY	Never, but I've been practicing.
L142068	u4595	m303	LIZA	Has this happened to you before?
L142067	u4592	m303	JERRY	Uh huh.
L142066	u4595	m303	LIZA	Was that who I thought it was?
L142062	u4592	m303	JERRY	Getting rid of my hub!
L142061	u4595	m303	LIZA	What are you doing?
L142054	u4592	m303	JERRY	I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
L142053	u4595	m303	LIZA	You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
L142052	u4592	m303	JERRY	Never heard of him.
L142051	u4595	m303	LIZA	Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
L142050	u4592	m303	JERRY	Who?
L142049	u4595	m303	LIZA	You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
L142048	u4595	m303	LIZA	You got a list?
L142047	u4592	m303	JERRY	Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
L142046	u4595	m303	LIZA	Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
L142045	u4592	m303	JERRY	Pretty scary, huh?
L142044	u4595	m303	LIZA	'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
L142043	u4592	m303	JERRY	Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
L142042	u4595	m303	LIZA	Can you prove any of this?
L142041	u4592	m303	JERRY	Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
L142040	u4595	m303	LIZA	'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
L142039	u4592	m303	JERRY	Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
L142038	u4595	m303	LIZA	Are these yours?
L142037	u4592	m303	JERRY	I've been reading up on it.
L142036	u4595	m303	LIZA	Equitation.
L142035	u4595	m303	LIZA	This would be it?
L142034	u4592	m303	JERRY	If my universe had a hub...
L142029	u4595	m303	LIZA	Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
L142028	u4592	m303	JERRY	You want something to drink?
L142026	u4592	m303	JERRY	The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
L142025	u4595	m303	LIZA	Surprise me.
L142024	u4592	m303	JERRY	You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
L142021	u4592	m303	JERRY	Flesh wound.  No big deal.
L142020	u4595	m303	LIZA	You okay?
L142017	u4595	m303	LIZA	Believe you about what?
L142016	u4592	m303	JERRY	You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
L142015	u4595	m303	LIZA	You're certifiable.
L142014	u4592	m303	JERRY	So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
L142012	u4595	m303	LIZA	What newsletter?
L142011	u4592	m303	JERRY	I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
L142010	u4595	m303	LIZA	So why are they after you?
L142009	u4592	m303	JERRY	I have no idea.
L142008	u4595	m303	LIZA	That's it?
L142007	u4595	m303	LIZA	Do they have a secret handshake?
L142006	u4592	m303	JERRY	Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
L142005	u4592	m303	JERRY	And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
L142004	u4595	m303	LIZA	What is it with you and the space program?
L142003	u4592	m303	JERRY	More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
L142002	u4592	m303	JERRY	Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
L142001	u4595	m303	LIZA	Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
L142000	u4592	m303	JERRY	Yeah.  I think so.
L141999	u4595	m303	LIZA	You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
L141991	u4595	m303	LIZA	Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
L141990	u4592	m303	JERRY	Six months.  Eleven days.
L141989	u4595	m303	LIZA	How long have we known each other, Jerry?
L141988	u4592	m303	JERRY	Nothing is easy.
L141987	u4595	m303	LIZA	See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
L141979	u4592	m303	JERRY	I noticed.
L141978	u4595	m303	LIZA	That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
L141977	u4592	m303	JERRY	Yes.
L141976	u4595	m303	LIZA	You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
L141975	u4592	m303	JERRY	People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
L141974	u4595	m303	LIZA	As opposed to?
L141973	u4592	m303	JERRY	Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
L141972	u4595	m303	LIZA	Yeah.
L141971	u4592	m303	JERRY	Flat, wraparound headlights?
L141970	u4592	m303	JERRY	Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
L141969	u4595	m303	LIZA	Them who?
L141968	u4592	m303	JERRY	Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
L141967	u4595	m303	LIZA	Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
L141966	u4592	m303	JERRY	If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
L141965	u4595	m303	LIZA	Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
L141964	u4592	m303	JERRY	Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
L141963	u4595	m303	LIZA	That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
L141962	u4592	m303	JERRY	What took so long?  You were in there all day.
L141961	u4592	m303	JERRY	Figure of speech.  Could we go?
L141960	u4595	m303	LIZA	Don't tell me you're naked back there.
L141959	u4592	m303	JERRY	Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
L141913	u4595	m303	LIZA	I can't promise you anything.
L141912	u4592	m303	JERRY	Arf... You gotta help me.
L141911	u4595	m303	LIZA	He says a dog bit his nose.
L141885	u4595	m303	LIZA	<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
L141884	u4592	m303	JERRY	You saved my life.
L141883	u4595	m303	LIZA	For what?
L141882	u4592	m303	JERRY	I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
L141881	u4592	m303	JERRY	Really?
L141880	u4595	m303	LIZA	I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
L141879	u4592	m303	JERRY	You switched the charts; you tell me.
L141878	u4595	m303	LIZA	You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
L141877	u4592	m303	JERRY	It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
L141876	u4592	m303	JERRY	Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
L141875	u4595	m303	LIZA	People do have heart attacks.
L141864	u4592	m303	JERRY	Love.
L141863	u4595	m303	LIZA	What is?
L141862	u4592	m303	JERRY	Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
L141860	u4595	m303	LIZA	I'll see you tomorrow.
L141859	u4592	m303	JERRY	Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
L141858	u4595	m303	LIZA	What?
L141857	u4592	m303	JERRY	Switch the charts.
L141856	u4595	m303	LIZA	Just relax.
L141853	u4595	m303	LIZA	You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
L141852	u4592	m303	JERRY	What's the charge?
L141829	u4592	m303	JERRY	You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
L141828	u4595	m303	LIZA	Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
L141827	u4592	m303	JERRY	It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
L141826	u4592	m303	JERRY	Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
L141825	u4595	m303	LIZA	You bit someone's nose off?
L141824	u4592	m303	JERRY	I bit the bastard's nose off.
L141788	u4592	m303	JERRY	Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
L141787	u4595	m303	LIZA	Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
L141786	u4592	m303	JERRY	What was your horse's name?
L141785	u4595	m303	LIZA	You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
L141784	u4592	m303	JERRY	I better get going.
L141783	u4595	m303	LIZA	No.
L141782	u4592	m303	JERRY	You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
L141781	u4595	m303	LIZA	I think you're different.
L141780	u4592	m303	JERRY	You think I'm crazy.
L141779	u4595	m303	LIZA	I can't promise you anything.
L141778	u4592	m303	JERRY	You going to warn him?
L141777	u4592	m303	JERRY	Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
L141776	u4595	m303	LIZA	<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
L141775	u4592	m303	JERRY	He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
L141774	u4595	m303	LIZA	Motive?
L141773	u4592	m303	JERRY	The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
L141772	u4595	m303	LIZA	Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
L141771	u4592	m303	JERRY	So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
L141770	u4595	m303	LIZA	Not for years.
L141769	u4592	m303	JERRY	Do you still ride?
L141768	u4595	m303	LIZA	I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
L141767	u4592	m303	JERRY	Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
L141766	u4595	m303	LIZA	Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
L141765	u4592	m303	JERRY	Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
L141764	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't see the connection.
L142403	u4592	m303	JERRY	Then I can't be hurt anymore.
L142402	u4593	m303	JONAS	Liza Sutton is dead.
L142384	u4592	m303	JERRY	You've never seen her run.
L142383	u4593	m303	JONAS	You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
L142382	u4592	m303	JERRY	<u>Liza</u>!
L142381	u4593	m303	JONAS	We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
L141803	u4593	m303	JONAS	Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
L141802	u4592	m303	JERRY	What's that?
L141801	u4592	m303	JERRY	Could you be a little more specific?
L141800	u4593	m303	JONAS	Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
L141799	u4592	m303	JERRY	That's great.  Good for you.
L141798	u4593	m303	JONAS	I'm a very patient man.
L141796	u4593	m303	JONAS	Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
L141795	u4592	m303	JERRY	Do I know you?
L142521	u4592	m303	JERRY	Whatever.
L142520	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
L142519	u4592	m303	JERRY	Then screw you.  I'll rot.
L142518	u4596	m303	LOWRY	I don't know...
L142517	u4592	m303	JERRY	That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
L142516	u4596	m303	LOWRY	We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
L142515	u4592	m303	JERRY	I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
L142512	u4596	m303	LOWRY	That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
L142511	u4592	m303	JERRY	I'm leaning toward no.
L142510	u4596	m303	LOWRY	You made your decision yet?
L142116	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Well, I don't know if --
L142115	u4592	m303	JERRY	I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
L142114	u4596	m303	LOWRY	It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
L142113	u4592	m303	JERRY	You're here because you figured I might show up.
L142112	u4596	m303	LOWRY	That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
L142111	u4592	m303	JERRY	You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
L142110	u4596	m303	LOWRY	I'm not sure what you mean.
L142109	u4592	m303	JERRY	I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
L142108	u4596	m303	LOWRY	You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
L142107	u4592	m303	JERRY	Thank you.
L142282	u4593	m303	JONAS	I want this box rigged with a beacon!
L142281	u4595	m303	LIZA	It's okay.  I'm game.
L142268	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't understand.
L142267	u4593	m303	JONAS	In Jerry's safety deposit box.
L142265	u4595	m303	LIZA	You sound so sure.
L142264	u4593	m303	JONAS	Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
L142263	u4595	m303	LIZA	Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
L142262	u4593	m303	JONAS	I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
L142261	u4595	m303	LIZA	It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
L142260	u4593	m303	JONAS	You do recognize it then?
L142259	u4595	m303	LIZA	Where'd you get it?
L142257	u4593	m303	JONAS	So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
L142256	u4595	m303	LIZA	If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
L142255	u4593	m303	JONAS	Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
L142254	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't believe you.
L142253	u4593	m303	JONAS	Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
L142252	u4595	m303	LIZA	I'm still listening.
L142248	u4593	m303	JONAS	Yes, that's right.
L142247	u4595	m303	LIZA	These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
L142246	u4593	m303	JONAS	<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
L142245	u4595	m303	LIZA	A dog.
L142244	u4593	m303	JONAS	And what did I say?
L142243	u4595	m303	LIZA	Jerry told me he bit your nose.
L142242	u4593	m303	JONAS	It was.  It was.
L142241	u4595	m303	LIZA	Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
L142240	u4593	m303	JONAS	Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
L142239	u4595	m303	LIZA	If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
L142238	u4593	m303	JONAS	As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
L142237	u4595	m303	LIZA	Terminal?
L142236	u4593	m303	JONAS	We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
L142235	u4593	m303	JONAS	I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
L142234	u4595	m303	LIZA	As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
L142233	u4593	m303	JONAS	M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
L142232	u4595	m303	LIZA	Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
L142231	u4593	m303	JONAS	A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
L142230	u4595	m303	LIZA	It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
L142229	u4593	m303	JONAS	Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
L142228	u4595	m303	LIZA	Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
L142227	u4593	m303	JONAS	What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
L142226	u4593	m303	JONAS	Please, sit.
L142225	u4595	m303	LIZA	Fine.  What the hell is going on?
L142224	u4593	m303	JONAS	If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
L141944	u4593	m303	JONAS	Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
L141943	u4595	m303	LIZA	Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
L141942	u4593	m303	JONAS	We're very specialized.
L141941	u4595	m303	LIZA	I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
L141940	u4593	m303	JONAS	Only on the football field.
L141939	u4595	m303	LIZA	That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
L141938	u4593	m303	JONAS	The truth shall make you free.
L141937	u4595	m303	LIZA	Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
L141934	u4595	m303	LIZA	A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
L141933	u4593	m303	JONAS	Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
L141932	u4595	m303	LIZA	Excuse me?
L141931	u4593	m303	JONAS	A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
L141930	u4595	m303	LIZA	Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
L141929	u4593	m303	JONAS	<u>Why you</u>?
L141928	u4595	m303	LIZA	I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
L141927	u4593	m303	JONAS	Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
L141926	u4595	m303	LIZA	You've asked me that one three times.
L141925	u4593	m303	JONAS	And you have no idea where he lives?
L141924	u4595	m303	LIZA	You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
L141923	u4593	m303	JONAS	So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
L141905	u4593	m303	JONAS	It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
L141904	u4595	m303	LIZA	And you feel bad for it?
L141903	u4593	m303	JONAS	You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
L141902	u4595	m303	LIZA	Excuse me?
L141901	u4593	m303	JONAS	A dog bit it.
L141900	u4595	m303	LIZA	Can I ask you something?
L142140	u4595	m303	LIZA	What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
L142139	u4594	m303	LAWYER	Liza, settle a bet for us.
L141818	u4595	m303	LIZA	Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
L141817	u4594	m303	LAWYER	I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
L141816	u4595	m303	LIZA	Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
L141815	u4594	m303	LAWYER	Night after that?
L141814	u4595	m303	LIZA	Working.
L141813	u4594	m303	LAWYER	Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
L141812	u4595	m303	LIZA	Working.
L141811	u4594	m303	LAWYER	So, you doing anything tonight?
L142395	u4595	m303	LIZA	Agent Lowry?
L142394	u4597	m303	OPERATOR	Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
L142390	u4595	m303	LIZA	Then this is a goddamn emergency.
L142389	u4597	m303	OPERATOR	Yes.
L142388	u4595	m303	LIZA	Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
L142387	u4597	m303	OPERATOR	The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
L142386	u4595	m303	LIZA	I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
L142385	u4597	m303	OPERATOR	Federal Bureau of Investigation.
L142277	u4598	m303	WILSON	What the hell does that mean?
L142276	u4595	m303	LIZA	Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
L142138	u4595	m303	LIZA	-- Understood.
L142137	u4598	m303	WILSON	I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
L142136	u4595	m303	LIZA	We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
L142135	u4598	m303	WILSON	Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
L142134	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
L142133	u4598	m303	WILSON	It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
L142132	u4595	m303	LIZA	This doesn't make sense.
L142131	u4598	m303	WILSON	I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
L141760	u4598	m303	WILSON	I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
L141759	u4595	m303	LIZA	Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
L141758	u4595	m303	LIZA	Not today...
L141757	u4598	m303	WILSON	Ah, your psychotic is here.
L142430	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't think so.
L142429	u4596	m303	LOWRY	That you come with me.
L142428	u4595	m303	LIZA	What do you suggest?
L142427	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
L142426	u4595	m303	LIZA	I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
L142425	u4596	m303	LOWRY	No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
L142424	u4595	m303	LIZA	Where do you think Jerry is?
L142423	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
L142422	u4595	m303	LIZA	He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
L142421	u4596	m303	LOWRY	He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
L142420	u4595	m303	LIZA	And Jonas?
L142419	u4596	m303	LOWRY	I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
L142417	u4595	m303	LIZA	Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
L142416	u4596	m303	LOWRY	What gave me away?
L142414	u4596	m303	LOWRY	You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
L142413	u4595	m303	LIZA	Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
L142412	u4596	m303	LOWRY	What do you mean?
L142411	u4595	m303	LIZA	I want to believe you, too.
L142410	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Yeah, I do.
L142409	u4595	m303	LIZA	Do you believe me?
L142408	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
L142407	u4595	m303	LIZA	Can I talk to you a second?
L141986	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Your call.  Have a good night.
L141985	u4595	m303	LIZA	When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
L141984	u4596	m303	LOWRY	It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
L141983	u4595	m303	LIZA	Jonas?
L141982	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Wasn't my idea.
L141981	u4595	m303	LIZA	Agent Lowry.
L141953	u4595	m303	LIZA	No.  Not yet.
L141952	u4596	m303	LOWRY	You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
L141947	u4595	m303	LIZA	I was just thinking that.
L141946	u4596	m303	LOWRY	That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
L141915	u4595	m303	LIZA	I don't know.  Didn't see him.
L141914	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Which way did he go?
L141892	u4595	m303	LIZA	You don't understand --
L141891	u4596	m303	LOWRY	Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
L141890	u4595	m303	LIZA	Wait --
L141889	u4596	m303	LOWRY	While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
L141888	u4595	m303	LIZA	Tell me about it.
L141887	u4596	m303	LOWRY	We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
L143230	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
L143229	u4609	m304	PETER	What?
L143228	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	There's no plug to pull.
L143227	u4609	m304	PETER	Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
L143226	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	We've lost contact.
L143224	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie?
L143223	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
L143218	u4609	m304	PETER	Anything happening in there, El?
L143217	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
L143216	u4609	m304	PETER	What?
L143386	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
L143385	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
L143380	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
L143379	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Is it possible...?
L143378	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
L143377	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes, sir.
L143376	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	He died...  ... in 1972.
L143375	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes, sir.
L143374	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
L142805	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
L142804	u4607	m304	KITZ	-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
L142797	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It's a hoax.  I knew it!
L142796	u4607	m304	KITZ	What in the hell...?
L142788	u4607	m304	KITZ	How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
L142787	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Hope there's a cartoon.
L142768	u4607	m304	KITZ	Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
L142767	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
L142760	u4607	m304	KITZ	Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
L142759	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
L142758	u4607	m304	KITZ	Dr. Arroway --
L142677	u4606	m304	KENT	So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
L142676	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	So?
L142675	u4606	m304	KENT	Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
L142674	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Tell me.
L142673	u4606	m304	KENT	Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
L142670	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
L142669	u4606	m304	KENT	Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
L142668	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
L143136	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
L143135	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Thank you?
L143134	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
L143133	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What would you have me say, David?
L143132	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
L143131	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Good luck, David.
L143130	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Right.  Well.
L143129	u4602	m304	ELLIE	This... seemed best.
L143128	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You aren't staying?
L143018	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
L143017	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
L143014	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
L143013	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
L142991	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
L142990	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You...
L142989	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
L142988	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What?
L142987	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
L142986	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
L142985	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I don't understand.
L142984	u4602	m304	ELLIE	David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
L142983	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It'll just take a moment.
L142982	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Actually I'm running late --
L142981	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Do you have a minute -- ?
L142980	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie.
L142979	u4602	m304	ELLIE	David --
L142972	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
L142971	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You mean --
L142970	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
L142969	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What is it?  What's happened?
L142900	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
L142899	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
L142852	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
L142851	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Are you threatening me?
L142850	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
L142849	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie --
L142848	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
L142847	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
L142846	u4602	m304	ELLIE	With me.
L142845	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
L142844	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What?  Why?
L142843	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
L142793	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
L142792	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
L142780	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
L142779	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... could it be a nested code of some sort?
L142757	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
L142756	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
L142755	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
L142704	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
L142703	u4602	m304	ELLIE	David --
L142702	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
L142701	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
L142700	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
L142699	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
L142698	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
L142697	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
L142696	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
L142695	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Meaning...
L142694	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It's not like you've given me much choice.
L142693	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You can't just pull the plug, David.
L142692	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
L142691	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
L142690	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You know why I'm here.
L142689	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
L142688	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie...
L142687	u4602	m304	ELLIE	No doubt.
L142686	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
L142685	u4602	m304	ELLIE	'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
L142684	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
L142683	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
L142682	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
L142681	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Oh?  How's he doing?
L142680	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Peter sends his regards.
L142679	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	No, thanks.
L142678	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pepsi?  Tequila?
L142609	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
L142608	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I disagree.
L142607	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
L142606	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
L142605	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're --
L142604	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
L142603	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
L142602	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
L142601	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm willing to take that risk.
L142600	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
L142914	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Well --
L142913	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	What's the status of the decryption effort?
L142908	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
L142907	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
L142896	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
L142895	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
L142831	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	How soon will you be able to decode it?
L142830	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
L142820	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
L142819	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	What does it say?
L142859	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
L142858	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How can that be?
L142857	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	No primer.
L142856	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And?
L142855	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
L142854	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What?
L142833	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
L142832	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
L142814	u4602	m304	ELLIE	A third layer.
L142813	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
L142812	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What...
L142782	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
L142781	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dr. Lunacharsky...?
L142728	u4613	m304	WILLIE	NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
L142727	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How's the spying tonight, guys?
L142723	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
L142722	u4613	m304	WILLIE	That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
L142718	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Put it on speakers.
L142717	u4613	m304	WILLIE	Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
L142713	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
L142712	u4613	m304	WILLIE	Got a bogey, boss?
L142665	u4602	m304	ELLIE	VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
L142664	u4613	m304	WILLIE	Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
L142663	u4602	m304	ELLIE	J39 Z186...?
L142818	u4606	m304	KENT	It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
L142817	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
L142774	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's a civilian facility.
L142773	u4606	m304	KENT	Can't we get rid of them?
L142736	u4606	m304	KENT	It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
L142735	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
L142667	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
L142666	u4606	m304	KENT	You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
L142655	u4606	m304	KENT	Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
L142654	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's beautiful.
L142653	u4606	m304	KENT	It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
L142652	u4602	m304	ELLIE	This is how you see the sky?
L142651	u4606	m304	KENT	Here, right around Centaurus A.
L142650	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Nice.  Where?
L142649	u4606	m304	KENT	1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
L142648	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Ellie.  Pulsar?
L142647	u4606	m304	KENT	Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
L142646	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dr. Cullers?
L143391	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Because I can't.
L143390	u4607	m304	KITZ	So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
L143384	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
L143383	u4607	m304	KITZ	Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
L143382	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
L143381	u4607	m304	KITZ	Please answer the question, Doctor.
L143373	u4602	m304	ELLIE	By our standards... yes.
L143372	u4607	m304	KITZ	In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
L143371	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
L143370	u4607	m304	KITZ	And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
L143369	u4602	m304	ELLIE	There is no direct evidence, no.
L143334	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
L143333	u4607	m304	KITZ	Is that your official response?
L143332	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
L142826	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
L142825	u4607	m304	KITZ	If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
L142824	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
L142777	u4607	m304	KITZ	And a hundred mile airspace.
L142776	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And a hundred mile airspace.
L142775	u4607	m304	KITZ	Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
L142770	u4607	m304	KITZ	You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
L142769	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
L142766	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You want to classify prime numbers?
L142765	u4607	m304	KITZ	I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
L142764	u4602	m304	ELLIE	This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
L142763	u4607	m304	KITZ	I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
L143310	u4612	m304	TED	Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
L143309	u4602	m304	ELLIE	No.  Please.
L143308	u4612	m304	TED	It's time to go home now.
L143306	u4612	m304	TED	Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
L143305	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
L143304	u4612	m304	TED	No more stalling, Captain.
L143303	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
L143302	u4612	m304	TED	That isn't the way it works.
L143301	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
L143300	u4612	m304	TED	Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
L143299	u4602	m304	ELLIE	None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
L143298	u4612	m304	TED	If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
L143297	u4602	m304	ELLIE	No!  I mean... why so soon?
L143296	u4612	m304	TED	Now... you go home.
L143295	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  What happens now?
L143294	u4612	m304	TED	You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
L143293	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
L143292	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The librarian... or the library...?
L143291	u4612	m304	TED	Am I one... or many?
L143282	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Can you help us?
L143281	u4612	m304	TED	... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
L143279	u4612	m304	TED	You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
L143278	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So we passed some kind of test?
L143277	u4612	m304	TED	Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
L143276	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
L143275	u4612	m304	TED	We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
L143274	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So who...?
L143273	u4612	m304	TED	Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
L143272	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
L143271	u4612	m304	TED	Many others.
L143270	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
L143269	u4612	m304	TED	You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
L143268	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Why did you contact us?
L143267	u4612	m304	TED	Small moves, Captain, small moves.
L143266	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Can you show me?
L143265	u4612	m304	TED	Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
L143264	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So who -- what -- are you?
L143262	u4612	m304	TED	We thought this might make things a little easier.
L143261	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
L143260	u4612	m304	TED	Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
L143259	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
L143258	u4612	m304	TED	That's my scientist.
L143257	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're not real.  None of this is.
L143256	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
L143255	u4612	m304	TED	I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
L143254	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
L142562	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Okay.
L142561	u4612	m304	TED	Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
L142558	u4612	m304	TED	That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
L142557	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pensacola.
L142556	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Okay, okay... there.
L142555	u4612	m304	TED	Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
L142554	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Could we hear God?
L142553	u4612	m304	TED	Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
L142552	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Could we hear to the moon?
L142551	u4612	m304	TED	On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
L142550	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Could we hear to China?
L142545	u4612	m304	TED	Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
L142544	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But what do I say?
L142543	u4612	m304	TED	Talk to him.
L142540	u4612	m304	TED	Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
L142539	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I can't move any smaller.
L142538	u4612	m304	TED	Small moves, Captain, small moves.
L143162	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
L143161	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Why don't you come back with me?
L143159	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- of Hadden Industries.
L143158	u4603	m304	HADDEN	As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
L143157	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Mmm.  Look closer.
L143156	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The systems integration site.
L143155	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Hokkaido Island.
L143154	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
L143153	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
L143152	u4603	m304	HADDEN	I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
L143151	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
L143150	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
L143149	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What are you talking about?  It's over.
L143148	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
L143147	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
L143146	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
L143145	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What's that?
L143144	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
L143143	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's so... small.
L143142	u4603	m304	HADDEN	A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
L142894	u4603	m304	HADDEN	That's my girl.  Done.
L142893	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
L142892	u4603	m304	HADDEN	In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
L142891	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And in return?
L142890	u4603	m304	HADDEN	That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
L142889	u4602	m304	ELLIE	A machine.  But a machine that does what?
L142888	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
L142887	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Some kind of circuitry...?
L142884	u4603	m304	HADDEN	-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
L142883	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
L142882	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Not if you think like a Vegan.
L142881	u4602	m304	ELLIE	A page-break signal.  A period.
L142880	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
L142878	u4603	m304	HADDEN	That's my girl...  Lights.
L142877	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
L142876	u4603	m304	HADDEN	I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
L142875	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
L142874	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
L142873	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I didn't realize I was out.
L142872	u4603	m304	HADDEN	The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
L142871	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What kind of deal?
L142870	u4603	m304	HADDEN	The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
L142869	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
L142868	u4603	m304	HADDEN	I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
L142867	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You live here.
L142866	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
L142865	u4602	m304	ELLIE	S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
L143122	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
L143121	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
L143120	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
L143119	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I thought you were here because you want to go.
L143118	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
L143117	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'd say this is slightly different.
L143020	u4602	m304	ELLIE	We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
L143019	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
L143331	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
L143330	u4609	m304	PETER	That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
L143329	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
L143321	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How long was I gone?
L143320	u4609	m304	PETER	What day?
L143319	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
L143318	u4609	m304	PETER	It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
L143317	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Wait -- hold on a minute --
L143316	u4609	m304	PETER	Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
L143315	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm -- I'm fine.
L143314	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie -- are you okay?
L143211	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Like it.  Almost there.
L143210	u4609	m304	PETER	Like it or not.
L143209	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That you, Valerian?
L143208	u4609	m304	PETER	It's really happening.
L143207	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Someone tell me this is really happening.
L142929	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You too.
L142928	u4609	m304	PETER	It's good to see you, Ellie.
L142921	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter.
L142920	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie.
L142644	u4609	m304	PETER	That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
L142643	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You sonofabitch.
L142642	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
L142641	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm serious about this, Peter --
L142640	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie --
L142639	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
L142638	u4609	m304	PETER	Jesus --
L142637	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
L142636	u4609	m304	PETER	Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
L142635	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
L142634	u4609	m304	PETER	'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
L142633	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But the work --
L142632	u4609	m304	PETER	This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
L142631	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But what about your research -- ?
L142630	u4609	m304	PETER	I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
L142629	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Greenbank?
L142628	u4609	m304	PETER	-- I'm moving to Washington.
L142627	u4602	m304	ELLIE	We could be together again --
L142626	u4609	m304	PETER	Actually --
L142625	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
L142624	u4609	m304	PETER	Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
L142623	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The V.L.A.?
L142622	u4609	m304	PETER	What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
L142621	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
L142620	u4609	m304	PETER	How close are you to getting this funding put together?
L142619	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
L142618	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
L142617	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
L142616	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
L142615	u4609	m304	PETER	And?
L142614	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
L142613	u4609	m304	PETER	Any luck on the grant money?
L142612	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
L142596	u4602	m304	ELLIE	'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
L142595	u4609	m304	PETER	'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
L142594	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
L142593	u4609	m304	PETER	They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
L142592	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
L142590	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
L142589	u4609	m304	PETER	Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
L142588	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
L142586	u4609	m304	PETER	Yavol.
L142585	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Sounds like a Russian general.
L142584	u4609	m304	PETER	Peter Valerian.
L142583	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Ellie.  Arroway.
L142582	u4609	m304	PETER	That's what they all say.
L142581	u4602	m304	ELLIE	He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
L142580	u4609	m304	PETER	It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
L142579	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
L143408	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
L143407	u4605	m304	JOSS	Meaning...
L143406	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
L143405	u4605	m304	JOSS	Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
L143404	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
L143403	u4605	m304	JOSS	In other words.
L143402	u4602	m304	ELLIE	In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
L143401	u4605	m304	JOSS	Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
L143400	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
L143362	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
L143361	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
L143360	u4605	m304	JOSS	Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
L143359	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But --
L143358	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
L143357	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
L143356	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
L143355	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't have any proof, Palmer.
L143354	u4605	m304	JOSS	It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
L143353	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
L143352	u4605	m304	JOSS	I do.
L143351	u4602	m304	ELLIE	They don't believe me.
L143350	u4605	m304	JOSS	I'm not sure it's come to that.
L143349	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
L143348	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
L143347	u4605	m304	JOSS	It was quite a page turner.
L143346	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm assuming you read my deposition.
L143345	u4605	m304	JOSS	Hi.
L143344	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Hi.
L143196	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
L143195	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
L143194	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I can't hear this now --
L143193	u4605	m304	JOSS	Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
L143192	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- I don't know --
L143191	u4605	m304	JOSS	And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
L143190	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
L143189	u4605	m304	JOSS	I'm in love with you, Ellie.
L143188	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please --
L143187	u4605	m304	JOSS	What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
L143186	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
L143185	u4605	m304	JOSS	What are you so afraid of?
L143184	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I can't do this --
L143183	u4605	m304	JOSS	What?
L143182	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm sorry -- I can't --
L143181	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, what is it?
L143180	u4605	m304	JOSS	What is it?
L143179	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm sorry.
L143178	u4605	m304	JOSS	What...?
L143177	u4605	m304	JOSS	Maybe that's okay.
L143176	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
L143175	u4605	m304	JOSS	You're trembling.
L143174	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Thank you.
L143173	u4605	m304	JOSS	During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
L143172	u4605	m304	JOSS	Oh.  I brought you something.
L143171	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The final countdown.
L143170	u4605	m304	JOSS	So.  The final countdown.
L143169	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
L143168	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
L143103	u4605	m304	JOSS	What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
L143102	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How do you mean?
L143101	u4605	m304	JOSS	An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
L143100	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
L143098	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's late.  We should go back.
L143097	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie --
L143095	u4605	m304	JOSS	What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
L143094	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's getting late...
L143093	u4605	m304	JOSS	And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
L143092	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
L143091	u4605	m304	JOSS	Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
L143090	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
L143089	u4605	m304	JOSS	I don't follow.
L143088	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
L143087	u4605	m304	JOSS	I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
L143086	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
L143085	u4605	m304	JOSS	I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
L143084	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
L143083	u4605	m304	JOSS	What'd you think?
L143082	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
L143081	u4605	m304	JOSS	Really.
L143080	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I read your book.
L143079	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
L143078	u4605	m304	JOSS	You're willing to die for this.
L143077	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
L143076	u4605	m304	JOSS	And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
L143075	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Something like that.
L143074	u4605	m304	JOSS	If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
L143073	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If you came back.
L143072	u4605	m304	JOSS	Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
L143071	u4602	m304	ELLIE	In other words.
L143070	u4605	m304	JOSS	In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
L143069	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
L143068	u4605	m304	JOSS	Why?
L143067	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't think so.
L143066	u4605	m304	JOSS	Maybe you're creating a monster.
L143065	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
L143064	u4605	m304	JOSS	Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
L143063	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
L143062	u4605	m304	JOSS	Some of my best friends are scientists.
L143061	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
L142968	u4605	m304	JOSS	Prove it.
L142967	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes.  Very much.
L142966	u4605	m304	JOSS	Did you love him?
L142965	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
L142964	u4605	m304	JOSS	Do you love your parents?
L142963	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
L142962	u4605	m304	JOSS	Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
L142961	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
L142960	u4605	m304	JOSS	I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
L142959	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Can you try?
L142958	u4605	m304	JOSS	... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
L142957	u4605	m304	JOSS	Now you know.
L142956	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
L142955	u4605	m304	JOSS	Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
L142954	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I flinched.
L142951	u4605	m304	JOSS	So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
L142950	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And mind, yes.  What are you --
L142949	u4605	m304	JOSS	And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
L142948	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
L142947	u4605	m304	JOSS	Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
L142943	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
L142942	u4605	m304	JOSS	'My father's house has many mansions.'
L142941	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
L142940	u4605	m304	JOSS	How do you mean?
L142939	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
L142938	u4605	m304	JOSS	Spoken like a true believer.
L142937	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
L142936	u4605	m304	JOSS	And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
L142935	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
L142934	u4605	m304	JOSS	... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
L142931	u4605	m304	JOSS	Make that two.
L142930	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Champagne please.
L142912	u4605	m304	JOSS	I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
L142911	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And where exactly does that put your position...?
L142910	u4605	m304	JOSS	I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
L143109	u4602	m304	ELLIE	For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
L143108	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
L143107	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
L143106	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
L143105	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
L143050	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
L143049	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
L143048	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
L143047	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
L143046	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
L143045	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
L143342	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Have your department make a full report.
L143341	u4607	m304	KITZ	I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
L143340	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Recommendations?
L143339	u4607	m304	KITZ	... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
L142836	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
L142835	u4607	m304	KITZ	But --
L142834	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
L142816	u4607	m304	KITZ	What is it?
L142815	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Oh my God...
L144516	u4636	m306	RUBEN	A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
L144515	u4626	m306	ANDY	It's good medicine.
L144407	u4626	m306	ANDY	Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
L144406	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Fear of what...
L144405	u4626	m306	ANDY	You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
L144404	u4636	m306	RUBEN	What did I do?
L144403	u4626	m306	ANDY	Now look what you did.
L144373	u4626	m306	ANDY	Only kidding!
L144372	u4636	m306	RUBEN	I hate this...
L144370	u4636	m306	RUBEN	None of your fucking business.
L144369	u4626	m306	ANDY	Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
L145061	u4626	m306	ANDY	Hal has it.
L145060	u4630	m306	HELEN	Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
L144897	u4626	m306	ANDY	But </u>alive</u>!
L144896	u4630	m306	HELEN	You bastard!
L144894	u4630	m306	HELEN	Stop acting like a silly little fag!
L144893	u4626	m306	ANDY	It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
L144892	u4630	m306	HELEN	You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
L144891	u4626	m306	ANDY	Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
L144695	u4626	m306	ANDY	I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
L144694	u4630	m306	HELEN	You're fired.
L144586	u4626	m306	ANDY	Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
L144585	u4630	m306	HELEN	Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
L144584	u4626	m306	ANDY	The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
L144519	u4630	m306	HELEN	Get out!  All of you!
L144518	u4626	m306	ANDY	I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
L144517	u4630	m306	HELEN	None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
L144471	u4626	m306	ANDY	Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
L144470	u4630	m306	HELEN	I can't, Andy.
L144469	u4630	m306	HELEN	About what?
L144468	u4626	m306	ANDY	When are you going to call them?
L144467	u4626	m306	ANDY	You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
L144466	u4630	m306	HELEN	Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
L144465	u4626	m306	ANDY	What?  What'd I do?
L144463	u4626	m306	ANDY	I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
L144462	u4630	m306	HELEN	I want to die.
L144461	u4626	m306	ANDY	No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
L144460	u4630	m306	HELEN	Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
L144368	u4626	m306	ANDY	Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
L144367	u4630	m306	HELEN	But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
L144366	u4626	m306	ANDY	Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
L144365	u4630	m306	HELEN	You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
L144363	u4630	m306	HELEN	Andy?
L144362	u4626	m306	ANDY	Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
L144361	u4626	m306	ANDY	Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
L144360	u4630	m306	HELEN	Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
L144359	u4626	m306	ANDY	When was the last time you washed your hair?
L144358	u4630	m306	HELEN	Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
L144357	u4630	m306	HELEN	Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
L144356	u4626	m306	ANDY	He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
L144355	u4630	m306	HELEN	He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
L144354	u4626	m306	ANDY	A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
L144353	u4630	m306	HELEN	"I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said ""You and me, you and me."""
L144352	u4626	m306	ANDY	Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
L144351	u4630	m306	HELEN	I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
L144350	u4626	m306	ANDY	Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
L144349	u4630	m306	HELEN	I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
L144348	u4626	m306	ANDY	Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
L144347	u4630	m306	HELEN	Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
L144572	u4626	m306	ANDY	Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
L144571	u4631	m306	M.J.	Tell her about <u>what</u>?
L144570	u4626	m306	ANDY	She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
L144411	u4626	m306	ANDY	Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
L144410	u4631	m306	M.J.	Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
L144409	u4626	m306	ANDY	Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
L144408	u4631	m306	M.J.	We'll get the paramedics...
L144385	u4631	m306	M.J.	You talked to me.  Do you remember?
L144384	u4626	m306	ANDY	Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
L144377	u4626	m306	ANDY	I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
L144376	u4631	m306	M.J.	Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
L144444	u4630	m306	HELEN	Yes.  I believed him.
L144443	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
L144442	u4630	m306	HELEN	When he was seventeen.
L144441	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	When was that?
L144440	u4630	m306	HELEN	He told me he had done two others just like it.
L144439	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
L144438	u4630	m306	HELEN	The first two murders.
L144435	u4630	m306	HELEN	The same as the first time...
L144434	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	What pattern was that?
L144433	u4630	m306	HELEN	He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
L144432	u4630	m306	HELEN	Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
L144431	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
L144430	u4630	m306	HELEN	I thought he was lying.
L144429	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
L144428	u4630	m306	HELEN	He was lying.
L144427	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
L144426	u4630	m306	HELEN	The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
L144425	u4627	m306	ATTORNEY	Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
L144424	u4630	m306	HELEN	Yes.  Without question.
L144976	u4628	m306	CONRAD	What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
L144975	u4631	m306	M.J.	What Friday?
L144974	u4628	m306	CONRAD	No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
L144973	u4631	m306	M.J.	You already made the delivery?
L144972	u4628	m306	CONRAD	Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
L144971	u4628	m306	CONRAD	I don't have it...
L144970	u4631	m306	M.J.	You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
L144969	u4628	m306	CONRAD	Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
L144968	u4631	m306	M.J.	Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
L144967	u4628	m306	CONRAD	You get me out first.
L144966	u4631	m306	M.J.	You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
L144965	u4628	m306	CONRAD	I never carried a gun!
L144964	u4631	m306	M.J.	Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
L144963	u4628	m306	CONRAD	I never hurt nobody...
L144962	u4631	m306	M.J.	Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
L144961	u4628	m306	CONRAD	I was?  How you spell that?
L144960	u4631	m306	M.J.	Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
L144959	u4628	m306	CONRAD	Who are you?
L144822	u4636	m306	RUBEN	She don't want it.
L144821	u4628	m306	CONRAD	She's supposed to have it.
L144820	u4636	m306	RUBEN	We know...  Send the book to evidence...
L144819	u4628	m306	CONRAD	The door was already open...
L144818	u4636	m306	RUBEN	He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
L144817	u4628	m306	CONRAD	Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
L144816	u4628	m306	CONRAD	I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
L144815	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Where is it?
L144814	u4628	m306	CONRAD	The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
L144813	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
L144812	u4628	m306	CONRAD	I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
L144811	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
L144930	u4629	m306	DARYLL	That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
L144929	u4630	m306	HELEN	In jail.
L144928	u4629	m306	DARYLL	Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
L144927	u4630	m306	HELEN	How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
L144926	u4629	m306	DARYLL	Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
L144925	u4630	m306	HELEN	Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
L144924	u4629	m306	DARYLL	You come and visit.
L144923	u4630	m306	HELEN	I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
L144922	u4629	m306	DARYLL	Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
L144921	u4630	m306	HELEN	I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
L144920	u4629	m306	DARYLL	Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
L144919	u4630	m306	HELEN	Ah ha.  What did he want?
L144918	u4629	m306	DARYLL	Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
L144917	u4630	m306	HELEN	I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
L144916	u4629	m306	DARYLL	Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
L144915	u4630	m306	HELEN	I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
L144914	u4629	m306	DARYLL	I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
L144913	u4630	m306	HELEN	What book?
L144912	u4629	m306	DARYLL	You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
L144911	u4630	m306	HELEN	Hello, Daryll Lee.
L145195	u4634	m306	PETER	Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
L145194	u4630	m306	HELEN	Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
L145193	u4634	m306	PETER	"Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  ""Let me help you..."""
L145190	u4634	m306	PETER	I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
L145189	u4630	m306	HELEN	That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
L145188	u4634	m306	PETER	Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
L145187	u4630	m306	HELEN	I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
L145186	u4634	m306	PETER	We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
L145181	u4634	m306	PETER	Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
L145180	u4630	m306	HELEN	Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
L145179	u4634	m306	PETER	No.  Not yet.
L145178	u4630	m306	HELEN	Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
L145141	u4630	m306	HELEN	Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
L145140	u4634	m306	PETER	You know where.
L145139	u4630	m306	HELEN	Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
L145136	u4634	m306	PETER	I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
L145135	u4630	m306	HELEN	You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
L145134	u4634	m306	PETER	I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
L145133	u4630	m306	HELEN	For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
L145131	u4634	m306	PETER	Oh, I think you will.
L145130	u4630	m306	HELEN	You know I can't do that.
L145129	u4634	m306	PETER	Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
L145128	u4630	m306	HELEN	It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
L145127	u4634	m306	PETER	What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
L145126	u4634	m306	PETER	<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
L145125	u4630	m306	HELEN	Where are you, Peter?
L145124	u4634	m306	PETER	You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
L145123	u4630	m306	HELEN	Who was the man in the basement?
L145122	u4634	m306	PETER	Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
L145224	u4631	m306	M.J.	Well, thanks.
L145223	u4630	m306	HELEN	Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
L145100	u4631	m306	M.J.	Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
L145099	u4630	m306	HELEN	If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
L145098	u4631	m306	M.J.	This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
L145097	u4630	m306	HELEN	He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
L145096	u4631	m306	M.J.	Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
L145095	u4630	m306	HELEN	They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
L145094	u4631	m306	M.J.	Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
L145036	u4631	m306	M.J.	Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
L145035	u4630	m306	HELEN	W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
L145034	u4631	m306	M.J.	How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
L145033	u4631	m306	M.J.	I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
L145032	u4630	m306	HELEN	I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
L145026	u4630	m306	HELEN	Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
L145025	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
L145024	u4630	m306	HELEN	Maybe you should...
L145023	u4631	m306	M.J.	Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
L145022	u4630	m306	HELEN	Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
L145021	u4631	m306	M.J.	Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
L145020	u4630	m306	HELEN	The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
L145019	u4631	m306	M.J.	What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
L145018	u4630	m306	HELEN	Who's the married man?
L145017	u4631	m306	M.J.	Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
L145016	u4630	m306	HELEN	You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
L145015	u4631	m306	M.J.	A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
L145014	u4630	m306	HELEN	He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
L145013	u4631	m306	M.J.	I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
L145012	u4631	m306	M.J.	Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
L145011	u4630	m306	HELEN	What happened to you?!
L144904	u4630	m306	HELEN	You do that one, I don't want it...
L144903	u4631	m306	M.J.	"They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: ""you make that <u>your</u> little job.""  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?"
L144902	u4630	m306	HELEN	Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
L144879	u4631	m306	M.J.	They get fan letters...
L144878	u4630	m306	HELEN	'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
L144869	u4630	m306	HELEN	It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
L144868	u4631	m306	M.J.	It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
L144867	u4630	m306	HELEN	They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
L144866	u4631	m306	M.J.	I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
L144865	u4630	m306	HELEN	What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
L144864	u4631	m306	M.J.	He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
L144863	u4630	m306	HELEN	They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
L144774	u4630	m306	HELEN	Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
L144773	u4631	m306	M.J.	Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
L144772	u4630	m306	HELEN	One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
L144771	u4631	m306	M.J.	What's that siren?
L144755	u4630	m306	HELEN	What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
L144754	u4631	m306	M.J.	Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
L144741	u4631	m306	M.J.	Because I'm all you've got.
L144740	u4630	m306	HELEN	Why should I trust you?
L144739	u4631	m306	M.J.	I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
L144738	u4630	m306	HELEN	You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
L144737	u4631	m306	M.J.	Halloran.
L144732	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'm giving you Clint outside.
L144731	u4630	m306	HELEN	This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
L144730	u4631	m306	M.J.	You're afraid of him.
L144729	u4630	m306	HELEN	Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
L144728	u4631	m306	M.J.	He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
L144727	u4630	m306	HELEN	Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
L144726	u4631	m306	M.J.	Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
L144725	u4630	m306	HELEN	It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
L144724	u4631	m306	M.J.	I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
L144723	u4630	m306	HELEN	Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
L144722	u4631	m306	M.J.	That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
L144719	u4631	m306	M.J.	That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
L144718	u4630	m306	HELEN	Is that it?
L144717	u4631	m306	M.J.	So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
L144716	u4630	m306	HELEN	There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
L144713	u4630	m306	HELEN	Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
L144712	u4631	m306	M.J.	Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
L144711	u4630	m306	HELEN	Ruben.
L144708	u4631	m306	M.J.	Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
L144707	u4630	m306	HELEN	That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
L144706	u4631	m306	M.J.	Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
L144705	u4630	m306	HELEN	Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
L144704	u4631	m306	M.J.	He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
L144703	u4630	m306	HELEN	I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
L144702	u4631	m306	M.J.	Who turned off the Internet computer...
L144701	u4630	m306	HELEN	You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
L144700	u4631	m306	M.J.	"She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says ""no dumping.""  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it."
L144699	u4630	m306	HELEN	Then what do you need me for?
L144698	u4631	m306	M.J.	But it's a different m.o.
L144697	u4630	m306	HELEN	That's no surprise.
L144696	u4631	m306	M.J.	We've got another one.
L144592	u4631	m306	M.J.	I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
L144591	u4630	m306	HELEN	He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
L144590	u4631	m306	M.J.	That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
L144581	u4630	m306	HELEN	Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
L144580	u4631	m306	M.J.	Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
L144579	u4630	m306	HELEN	It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
L144578	u4631	m306	M.J.	Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
L144577	u4630	m306	HELEN	She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
L144576	u4631	m306	M.J.	I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
L144575	u4630	m306	HELEN	Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
L144574	u4631	m306	M.J.	I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
L144573	u4630	m306	HELEN	I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
L144560	u4630	m306	HELEN	Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
L144559	u4631	m306	M.J.	We'll show that to...
L144553	u4631	m306	M.J.	<u>He</u> won't.
L144552	u4630	m306	HELEN	One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
L144551	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'm going to put a guard on your door.
L144546	u4630	m306	HELEN	It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
L144545	u4631	m306	M.J.	Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
L144539	u4630	m306	HELEN	Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
L144538	u4631	m306	M.J.	How do you know that?
L144513	u4631	m306	M.J.	Work with me.
L144512	u4630	m306	HELEN	If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
L144511	u4631	m306	M.J.	Why imitate a dead serial killer?
L144507	u4630	m306	HELEN	I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
L144506	u4631	m306	M.J.	How did you know they were stockings?
L144505	u4630	m306	HELEN	Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
L144504	u4631	m306	M.J.	Nothing.
L144503	u4630	m306	HELEN	The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
L144502	u4630	m306	HELEN	He felt remorse.  He covered her.
L144501	u4631	m306	M.J.	How do you know that?
L144500	u4630	m306	HELEN	It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
L144499	u4631	m306	M.J.	For months... last October.
L144498	u4630	m306	HELEN	Is it an ongoing case?
L144400	u4631	m306	M.J.	You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
L144399	u4630	m306	HELEN	Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
L144398	u4631	m306	M.J.	Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
L144397	u4630	m306	HELEN	Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
L144396	u4631	m306	M.J.	I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
L144395	u4630	m306	HELEN	Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
L144394	u4631	m306	M.J.	Would you want to work with us on this?
L144393	u4630	m306	HELEN	Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
L144392	u4631	m306	M.J.	Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
L144391	u4630	m306	HELEN	Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
L144390	u4631	m306	M.J.	<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
L144389	u4630	m306	HELEN	You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
L144388	u4631	m306	M.J.	I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
L144383	u4630	m306	HELEN	What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
L144382	u4631	m306	M.J.	Because of your phone calls.
L144381	u4630	m306	HELEN	If he's not out, why are they here?
L144380	u4631	m306	M.J.	Who?
L144379	u4630	m306	HELEN	Is he out?
L144378	u4631	m306	M.J.	Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
L144345	u4631	m306	M.J.	That's an opinion, not evidence...
L144344	u4630	m306	HELEN	I think this is number three...
L144343	u4631	m306	M.J.	Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
L144342	u4630	m306	HELEN	You're calling me a crank?
L144341	u4631	m306	M.J.	No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
L144337	u4631	m306	M.J.	Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
L144336	u4630	m306	HELEN	Who is this?
L144835	u4630	m306	HELEN	What else?
L144834	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
L144833	u4630	m306	HELEN	They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
L144832	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You know how to use this?
L144827	u4636	m306	RUBEN	I know, baby.  I know.
L144826	u4630	m306	HELEN	He was in my apartment!
L144825	u4630	m306	HELEN	Why don't you shoot off the lock?
L144824	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Open the door.  Please.
L144764	u4630	m306	HELEN	Go and look for a note.
L144763	u4636	m306	RUBEN	They all have one...
L144762	u4630	m306	HELEN	Is there a phone booth there?
L144761	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Yes.
L144760	u4630	m306	HELEN	Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
L144759	u4636	m306	RUBEN	<u>What</u>?...
L144758	u4630	m306	HELEN	Don't hang up!
L144753	u4630	m306	HELEN	She on the passenger side?
L144752	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Yes.  I have to go...
L144751	u4630	m306	HELEN	It's a woman shot in a car?
L144617	u4630	m306	HELEN	Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
L144616	u4636	m306	RUBEN	I'll get a locksmith.
L144615	u4630	m306	HELEN	The lock...
L144613	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
L144612	u4630	m306	HELEN	Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
L144609	u4630	m306	HELEN	I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
L144608	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Tell me what to do!
L144602	u4630	m306	HELEN	Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
L144601	u4636	m306	RUBEN	The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
L144600	u4636	m306	RUBEN	No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
L144599	u4630	m306	HELEN	Are you always so bold?
L144598	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Not yet.
L144597	u4630	m306	HELEN	You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
L144594	u4630	m306	HELEN	That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
L144593	u4636	m306	RUBEN	We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
L144589	u4630	m306	HELEN	MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
L144588	u4636	m306	RUBEN	MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
L144587	u4630	m306	HELEN	I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
L144558	u4630	m306	HELEN	He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
L144557	u4636	m306	RUBEN	I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
L144556	u4630	m306	HELEN	It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
L144550	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Let me get a little action started here.
L144549	u4630	m306	HELEN	"It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- ""Son of Sam"" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you."
L144544	u4630	m306	HELEN	He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
L144543	u4636	m306	RUBEN	He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
L144542	u4630	m306	HELEN	That computer's wired into INTERNET.
L144510	u4630	m306	HELEN	In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
L144509	u4636	m306	RUBEN	The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
L144508	u4630	m306	HELEN	Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
L144402	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
L144401	u4630	m306	HELEN	I don't want this.  What are they?
L144387	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
L144386	u4630	m306	HELEN	You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
L145160	u4630	m306	HELEN	He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
L145159	u4637	m306	SAKS	You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
L145158	u4630	m306	HELEN	He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
L145157	u4637	m306	SAKS	Just get out of your vehicle...
L145156	u4630	m306	HELEN	Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
L145155	u4637	m306	SAKS	Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
L144851	u4637	m306	SAKS	We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
L144850	u4631	m306	M.J.	Okay.
L144849	u4637	m306	SAKS	She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
L144848	u4631	m306	M.J.	How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
L144847	u4637	m306	SAKS	Who prescribes the brandy?
L144846	u4631	m306	M.J.	She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
L144845	u4637	m306	SAKS	We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
L144844	u4631	m306	M.J.	Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
L144843	u4637	m306	SAKS	I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
L144842	u4631	m306	M.J.	Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
L144841	u4637	m306	SAKS	We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
L144840	u4631	m306	M.J.	Over here.
L144839	u4637	m306	SAKS	"Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called ""Murder By Numbers.""  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?"
L144294	u4632	m306	MIKE	Lieutenant  Quinn.
L144293	u4631	m306	M.J.	Who came in after you?
L144292	u4632	m306	MIKE	Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
L144291	u4631	m306	M.J.	Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
L144277	u4632	m306	MIKE	No.  I didn't.
L144276	u4631	m306	M.J.	You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
L144275	u4632	m306	MIKE	Michael Johnson.
L144274	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
L144273	u4632	m306	MIKE	I was.
L145090	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Don't ever forget how good you are.
L145089	u4631	m306	M.J.	Just horseshit luck.
L145088	u4633	m306	NIKKO	I heard. Good police work.
L144996	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
L144995	u4631	m306	M.J.	You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
L144994	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
L144993	u4631	m306	M.J.	Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
L144645	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
L144644	u4631	m306	M.J.	If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
L144485	u4631	m306	M.J.	God, you're cute when you're mad.
L144484	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
L144483	u4631	m306	M.J.	Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
L144482	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
L144481	u4631	m306	M.J.	Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
L144480	u4633	m306	NIKKO	You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
L144479	u4631	m306	M.J.	You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
L144478	u4633	m306	NIKKO	It's none of my business anymore...
L144475	u4631	m306	M.J.	Oh, I know.
L144474	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Working late.  You're a damn fool.
L144328	u4631	m306	M.J.	Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
L144327	u4633	m306	NIKKO	Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
L144326	u4631	m306	M.J.	Because it's your job, that's all.
L144325	u4633	m306	NIKKO	What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
L144956	u4636	m306	RUBEN	I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
L144955	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
L144938	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Talk to Nikko...!
L144937	u4631	m306	M.J.	Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
L144936	u4636	m306	RUBEN	The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
L144766	u4631	m306	M.J.	Helen... excuse me, we...
L144765	u4636	m306	RUBEN	She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
L144757	u4631	m306	M.J.	Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
L144756	u4636	m306	RUBEN	What's Abba?
L144664	u4631	m306	M.J.	The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
L144663	u4636	m306	RUBEN	It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
L144662	u4631	m306	M.J.	You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
L144661	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
L144660	u4631	m306	M.J.	Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
L144652	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Look at him, grandstanding...
L144651	u4631	m306	M.J.	Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
L144650	u4631	m306	M.J.	Yeah, everything's different.
L144649	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
L144648	u4631	m306	M.J.	Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
L144641	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
L144640	u4631	m306	M.J.	Look at her legs.
L144639	u4636	m306	RUBEN	She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
L144637	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
L144636	u4631	m306	M.J.	What about her arms?
L144635	u4636	m306	RUBEN	She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
L144632	u4631	m306	M.J.	Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
L144631	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
L144583	u4631	m306	M.J.	My promise.
L144582	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Absolutely.
L144548	u4631	m306	M.J.	Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
L144547	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
L144521	u4631	m306	M.J.	Let's get out of here...
L144520	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
L144492	u4631	m306	M.J.	Tell it to your shrink.
L144491	u4636	m306	RUBEN	I like women like that!
L144490	u4631	m306	M.J.	Honest to God, Ruben!
L144489	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Nada.  Lemme make the call.
L144488	u4631	m306	M.J.	He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
L144487	u4636	m306	RUBEN	What's wrong with him?
L144417	u4631	m306	M.J.	Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
L144416	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You came in there with this attitude...
L144415	u4631	m306	M.J.	Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
L144414	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Classy madonna.
L144413	u4631	m306	M.J.	Snotty neurotic bitch...
L144331	u4636	m306	RUBEN	It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
L144330	u4631	m306	M.J.	Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
L144258	u4636	m306	RUBEN	You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
L144257	u4631	m306	M.J.	You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
L144254	u4636	m306	RUBEN	I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
L144253	u4631	m306	M.J.	Answer it.
L144246	u4636	m306	RUBEN	Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
L144245	u4631	m306	M.J.	My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
L145218	u4635	m306	QUINN	No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
L145217	u4631	m306	M.J.	She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
L145047	u4635	m306	QUINN	Spokes<u>person</u>.
L145046	u4631	m306	M.J.	That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
L145001	u4635	m306	QUINN	So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
L145000	u4631	m306	M.J.	You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
L144953	u4635	m306	QUINN	Nikko?
L144952	u4631	m306	M.J.	Give me Ruben back...
L144951	u4635	m306	QUINN	Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
L144950	u4631	m306	M.J.	Or the F.B.I.?
L144949	u4635	m306	QUINN	You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
L144948	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
L144947	u4635	m306	QUINN	How'd you get in on the deal?
L144946	u4635	m306	QUINN	You got a suspect...
L144945	u4631	m306	M.J.	The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
L144941	u4631	m306	M.J.	I gotta have Ruben, and a...
L144940	u4635	m306	QUINN	I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
L144858	u4631	m306	M.J.	Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
L144857	u4635	m306	QUINN	Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
L144856	u4631	m306	M.J.	If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
L144855	u4635	m306	QUINN	Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
L144854	u4631	m306	M.J.	What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
L144853	u4635	m306	QUINN	M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
L144690	u4631	m306	M.J.	Because I think I'm wrong.
L144689	u4635	m306	QUINN	What the hell you need her for?
L144688	u4631	m306	M.J.	Helen Hudson...
L144687	u4635	m306	QUINN	Where you going?
L144686	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
L144685	u4635	m306	QUINN	Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
L144684	u4631	m306	M.J.	You're damn right I do.
L144683	u4635	m306	QUINN	Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
L144682	u4631	m306	M.J.	It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
L144681	u4635	m306	QUINN	So what have we got?
L144566	u4635	m306	QUINN	With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
L144565	u4631	m306	M.J.	We could use a little help.
L144564	u4635	m306	QUINN	"What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. ""Let me help you!"""
L144563	u4631	m306	M.J.	Oh, maaaaan?!
L144529	u4635	m306	QUINN	Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
L144528	u4631	m306	M.J.	So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
L144527	u4635	m306	QUINN	I know.  Get out here.
L144526	u4631	m306	M.J.	I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
L144525	u4635	m306	QUINN	Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
L144524	u4631	m306	M.J.	Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
L144458	u4631	m306	M.J.	Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
L144457	u4635	m306	QUINN	You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
L144456	u4631	m306	M.J.	Yessir.
L144455	u4635	m306	QUINN	Sergeant?
L144454	u4631	m306	M.J.	That's always your privilege, sir.
L144453	u4635	m306	QUINN	How about I put Nikko on it?
L144452	u4631	m306	M.J.	Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
L144451	u4635	m306	QUINN	I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
L144450	u4635	m306	QUINN	Would you step outside, Sergeant?
L144449	u4631	m306	M.J.	What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
L144448	u4635	m306	QUINN	What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
L144447	u4631	m306	M.J.	The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
L144446	u4635	m306	QUINN	There was no sperm.
L144317	u4631	m306	M.J.	Good.
L144316	u4635	m306	QUINN	We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
L144315	u4631	m306	M.J.	Right.
L144314	u4635	m306	QUINN	This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
L144313	u4631	m306	M.J.	Right.
L144312	u4635	m306	QUINN	You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
L144308	u4635	m306	QUINN	I said you were...
L144307	u4631	m306	M.J.	Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
L144306	u4635	m306	QUINN	I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
L144303	u4635	m306	QUINN	Shut up.
L144302	u4631	m306	M.J.	You messed with the scene.
L144658	u4631	m306	M.J.	We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
L144657	u4638	m306	SUSAN	Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
L144655	u4638	m306	SUSAN	What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
L144654	u4631	m306	M.J.	Detective Niccoletti?
L144305	u4631	m306	M.J.	You messed with the evidence.
L144304	u4638	m306	SUSAN	... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
L144268	u4631	m306	M.J.	I just got here.  Talk to you later...
L144267	u4638	m306	SUSAN	...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
L144266	u4631	m306	M.J.	I just got here myself, Susan.
L144678	u4635	m306	QUINN	What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
L144677	u4633	m306	NIKKO	I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
L144676	u4635	m306	QUINN	Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
L144675	u4633	m306	NIKKO	She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
L144674	u4635	m306	QUINN	Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
L144673	u4633	m306	NIKKO	We were together six years, sir!
L144672	u4635	m306	QUINN	She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
L144671	u4633	m306	NIKKO	He's not treating her right...
L144626	u4639	m306	WOMAN	That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
L144625	u4634	m306	PETER	She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
L144624	u4639	m306	WOMAN	She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
L144623	u4634	m306	PETER	Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
L144622	u4639	m306	WOMAN	See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
L144621	u4639	m306	WOMAN	You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
L144620	u4634	m306	PETER	Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
L144619	u4639	m306	WOMAN	Put in the Kevin Costner.
L153146	u4739	m315	BARBER	Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
L153145	u4749	m315	WHITE	Not really...
L153144	u4739	m315	BARBER	Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
L153141	u4739	m315	BARBER	Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
L153140	u4749	m315	WHITE	The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
L153139	u4739	m315	BARBER	What of?
L153138	u4749	m315	WHITE	Sell maps?
L153135	u4739	m315	BARBER	Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
L153134	u4749	m315	WHITE	Thanks.  Just some pills.
L153133	u4739	m315	BARBER	Looks like you need a haircut to me.
L153132	u4749	m315	WHITE	I need something to keep me awake.
L153400	u4741	m315	COP	Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
L153399	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	How will we interrogate them?
L153398	u4741	m315	COP	They don't speak English...
L153393	u4741	m315	COP	No one available.
L153392	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
L153391	u4741	m315	COP	His wife.
L153390	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	The other one?
L153389	u4741	m315	COP	All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
L153293	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
L153292	u4741	m315	COP	Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
L153291	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What's he doing here?
L153174	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Spinning backwards?
L153173	u4741	m315	COP	Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
L153172	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	How long have you been here?
L153488	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I'm afraid so.
L153487	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Was that for real down there?
L153467	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
L153466	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What is this place?
L153465	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Just like that?
L153464	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	In there.
L153463	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
L153462	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Please, they'll kill me...
L153459	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You are mistaken.
L153458	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
L153457	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I don't know what you're talking about.
L153456	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
L153322	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Loose ends?
L153321	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
L153320	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
L153319	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
L153318	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	He's seriously disturbed...
L153317	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Really?  And how is his state of mind?
L153316	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Just visiting my patient.
L153315	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Doctor!  What brings you here?
L153255	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
L153254	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	He tried to kill me!
L153253	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Police.  Nobody move.
L153340	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Yes, sir.
L153339	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
L153335	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	How could you have been so stupid?
L153334	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
L153329	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I see...
L153328	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
L153131	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
L153130	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Lost something?
L153129	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
L153128	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
L153127	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Its extremely important to my investigation...
L153126	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	A hunch.  He might be able to...
L153125	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Why do you want to speak to him?
L153072	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Shes getting better, thanks.  She...
L153071	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
L153070	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
L153068	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on.
L153067	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
L153066	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
L153062	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Yes.  This way.
L153061	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Good evening, sir.
L153417	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
L153416	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
L153415	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
L153413	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Put it through...
L153412	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
L153411	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Who is it?
L153119	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Well be more careful, please.
L153118	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Why, yes.
L153117	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Do you wash your hands before you type things?
L153116	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Im sorry...
L153115	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	How can I submit this?
L153114	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
L153113	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	It seems fine.
L153112	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Wrong?  Look at this!
L153111	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
L153110	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	You typed this report?
L153097	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Fine.
L153096	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	You wont regret this, sir.
L153095	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Good.
L153094	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
L153093	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
L153092	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I didnt requisition a secretary.
L153091	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Im your new assistant.
L153090	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Patricia Crenshaw.
L153089	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
L153088	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Sorry, sir.
L153087	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Dammit!
L153492	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
L153491	u4749	m315	WHITE	What now?
L153472	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	It sure isn't the fun-fair.
L153471	u4749	m315	WHITE	Where do you think this goes?
L153454	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
L153453	u4749	m315	WHITE	Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
L153452	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Go on.
L153449	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
L153448	u4749	m315	WHITE	What?
L153447	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	They didn't have faces.
L153428	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Don't know much, do you?
L153427	u4749	m315	WHITE	Don't know that either.
L153426	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Why are they after you?
L153425	u4749	m315	WHITE	I don't know who they are.
L153424	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Who?
L153423	u4749	m315	WHITE	People...  after me.
L153422	u4749	m315	WHITE	I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
L153421	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
L153420	u4749	m315	WHITE	I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
L153419	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Why give yourself up?
L153267	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Shut-up.
L153266	u4749	m315	WHITE	Where are we going?
L153385	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
L153384	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	But...  How long has this been happening?
L153383	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	No...  No doctor...
L153382	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
L153379	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What is going on?
L153378	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
L153377	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What?  Who has?
L153376	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	They've taken my mind, my memories...
L153372	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	Not that.  Anything else.
L153371	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
L153370	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	Can't let you in...  sorry.
L153517	u4742	m315	KARL	It must be a closet or something.
L153516	u4749	m315	WHITE	Where does it lead?
L153515	u4742	m315	KARL	Yes.
L153514	u4749	m315	WHITE	You see it?
L153513	u4749	m315	WHITE	No.  Have a look.
L153512	u4742	m315	KARL	Such a joker!  Like your father.
L153511	u4749	m315	WHITE	There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
L153510	u4742	m315	KARL	Which one?
L153509	u4749	m315	WHITE	What is that door?
L153508	u4742	m315	KARL	Look!  This is a good one!
L153588	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
L153587	u4749	m315	WHITE	I didn't realise...
L153584	u4749	m315	WHITE	Wait, this isn't fair...
L153583	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	I see.  The verdict, yes...
L153582	u4749	m315	WHITE	But I...
L153581	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	A book of delusions.  Anything else?
L153574	u4749	m315	WHITE	Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
L153573	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	A fanciful idea, Mister White.
L153170	u4745	m315	PRIEST	Please...
L153169	u4749	m315	WHITE	Shut up!
L153168	u4745	m315	PRIEST	Dont kill me!
L153165	u4749	m315	WHITE	Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
L153164	u4745	m315	PRIEST	I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
L153163	u4749	m315	WHITE	No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
L153162	u4745	m315	PRIEST	Then we must call the police.
L153161	u4749	m315	WHITE	Someones after me.
L153160	u4745	m315	PRIEST	You seem restless.
L153159	u4749	m315	WHITE	No.  I, ah...
L153543	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	We are...  living in their dreams...
L153542	u4749	m315	WHITE	What is it?
L153540	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I'm...  being...  punished.
L153539	u4749	m315	WHITE	What happened to you?
L153461	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Nothing.  I don't know anything!
L153460	u4749	m315	WHITE	What are you hiding?
L153312	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
L153311	u4749	m315	WHITE	It's a trick.
L153308	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
L153307	u4749	m315	WHITE	Why?
L153306	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
L153305	u4749	m315	WHITE	You've been working too hard.
L153302	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
L153301	u4749	m315	WHITE	Not that again...
L153300	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
L153299	u4749	m315	WHITE	So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
L153298	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	No, it's the truth.
L153297	u4749	m315	WHITE	You're a liar!
L153243	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
L153242	u4749	m315	WHITE	I have to go...
L153241	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	What are you doing?
L153231	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
L153230	u4749	m315	WHITE	I'm sorry.  About before.
L153222	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Maybe.
L153221	u4749	m315	WHITE	Can I get my life back?
L153219	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
L153218	u4749	m315	WHITE	I'm nothing then.
L153217	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
L153215	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
L153214	u4749	m315	WHITE	Horrible...
L153213	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
L153212	u4749	m315	WHITE	Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
L153209	u4749	m315	WHITE	I told you, I can't remember a thing!
L153208	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
L153207	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Well...
L153206	u4749	m315	WHITE	Known me for long?
L153205	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
L153204	u4749	m315	WHITE	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
L153203	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	If you like.
L153202	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Tell me about them...
L153201	u4749	m315	WHITE	Yes.
L153200	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Bad dreams?
L153199	u4749	m315	WHITE	That's what people keep telling me.
L153198	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Your name is John White.
L153197	u4749	m315	WHITE	Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
L153196	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	What does she say?  The woman.
L153195	u4749	m315	WHITE	Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
L153194	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Water?
L153193	u4749	m315	WHITE	You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
L153192	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
L153191	u4749	m315	WHITE	You know something about me?
L153190	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
L153364	u4750	m315	WIFE	That's easy.  You...
L153363	u4749	m315	WHITE	How do I get there?  Tell me.
L153356	u4750	m315	WIFE	They're dead, John.
L153355	u4749	m315	WHITE	I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
L153354	u4750	m315	WIFE	Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
L153353	u4749	m315	WHITE	How do you know I'm innocent?
L153352	u4750	m315	WIFE	It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
L153351	u4749	m315	WHITE	I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
L182028	u4999	m332	JACK	You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
L182027	u4990	m332	BOXER	You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
L182026	u4999	m332	JACK	We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
L182025	u4999	m332	JACK	How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
L182024	u4990	m332	BOXER	Till 19-fucking-70.
L182023	u4999	m332	JACK	You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
L182022	u4990	m332	BOXER	What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
L182021	u4999	m332	JACK	I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
L182020	u4990	m332	BOXER	What's it to you?
L182019	u4999	m332	JACK	How's the left these days?
L182548	u4991	m332	BUD	No.  Now.  You fucked him.
L182547	u5001	m332	LYNN	In the morning.
L182546	u4991	m332	BUD	So tell me about it.
L182545	u5001	m332	LYNN	We talked.
L182544	u4991	m332	BUD	You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
L182543	u5001	m332	LYNN	Come in out of the rain, Bud.
L182542	u4991	m332	BUD	How'd you get to know so much about him?
L182541	u5001	m332	LYNN	He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
L182540	u4991	m332	BUD	I want to know about Exley.
L182539	u5001	m332	LYNN	Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
L182538	u4991	m332	BUD	Did you talk to Exley?
L182272	u4991	m332	BUD	That simple, huh?
L182271	u5001	m332	LYNN	You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
L182268	u4991	m332	BUD	I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
L182267	u5001	m332	LYNN	Do you like being a cop, Bud?
L182266	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah.  But not for long.
L182265	u5001	m332	LYNN	So you saved her.
L182264	u4991	m332	BUD	When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
L182263	u5001	m332	LYNN	It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
L182240	u4991	m332	BUD	It's Bud.
L182239	u5001	m332	LYNN	I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
L182083	u4991	m332	BUD	Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
L182082	u5001	m332	LYNN	If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
L182081	u4991	m332	BUD	I don't know.
L182080	u5001	m332	LYNN	Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
L182079	u4991	m332	BUD	Look.  I want to see you again.
L182077	u5001	m332	LYNN	No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
L182076	u4991	m332	BUD	He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
L182075	u5001	m332	LYNN	He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
L182074	u4991	m332	BUD	You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
L182073	u5001	m332	LYNN	Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
L182072	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
L182071	u5001	m332	LYNN	But you did it anyway.
L182070	u4991	m332	BUD	I'm not sure.
L182069	u5001	m332	LYNN	Did they deserve it today?
L182068	u4991	m332	BUD	When they deserve it.
L182067	u5001	m332	LYNN	Do you enjoy it?
L182066	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah.
L182065	u5001	m332	LYNN	There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
L182064	u4991	m332	BUD	You fuck for money.
L182063	u5001	m332	LYNN	You say 'fuck' a lot.
L182062	u4991	m332	BUD	Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
L182061	u5001	m332	LYNN	I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
L182060	u4991	m332	BUD	Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
L182059	u5001	m332	LYNN	It's Lynn.
L182058	u4991	m332	BUD	You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
L182057	u5001	m332	LYNN	He's waiting for you to mention mention.
L182056	u4991	m332	BUD	Tell me about Patchett.
L182055	u5001	m332	LYNN	Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
L182054	u4991	m332	BUD	How'd she meet Patchett?
L182053	u5001	m332	LYNN	Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
L182052	u4991	m332	BUD	Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
L182051	u5001	m332	LYNN	I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
L182050	u4991	m332	BUD	Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
L182049	u5001	m332	LYNN	That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
L182048	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
L182047	u5001	m332	LYNN	Yes.  But do you know?
L182046	u4991	m332	BUD	You use words like that, you might make me mad.
L182045	u5001	m332	LYNN	No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
L182044	u4991	m332	BUD	Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
L182043	u5001	m332	LYNN	Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
L182042	u4991	m332	BUD	Are you sorry she's dead?
L182041	u5001	m332	LYNN	I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
L182040	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah, plain scotch.
L182039	u5001	m332	LYNN	Can I get you a drink?
L181716	u5001	m332	LYNN	It's not what you think.
L181715	u4991	m332	BUD	Somebody hit you?
L181706	u5001	m332	LYNN	It's practically stamped on your forehead.
L181705	u4991	m332	BUD	That obvious, huh?
L181704	u5001	m332	LYNN	Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
L181703	u4991	m332	BUD	Merry Christmas.
L182501	u4991	m332	BUD	Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
L182500	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
L182499	u4991	m332	BUD	You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
L182498	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
L182497	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
L182496	u4991	m332	BUD	What work?
L182495	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
L182165	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	You've got it, Wendell.
L182164	u4991	m332	BUD	Give me one minute.
L181868	u4991	m332	BUD	How'd you get them to retract?
L181867	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	How what, Wendell?
L181866	u4991	m332	BUD	Of course... But how?
L181865	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Will you work for me?
L181862	u4991	m332	BUD	Homicide?  A detective?
L181861	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
L181860	u4991	m332	BUD	How?
L181859	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
L181858	u4991	m332	BUD	I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
L181857	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	They're yours.  Take them.
L181856	u4991	m332	BUD	Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
L181855	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
L181854	u4991	m332	BUD	<u>What do you want</u>?
L181853	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
L181852	u4991	m332	BUD	Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
L181851	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
L181850	u4991	m332	BUD	He helped me out once.  That's all.
L181849	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
L181848	u4991	m332	BUD	What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
L181847	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
L181846	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah, I hate them.
L181845	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
L181844	u4991	m332	BUD	Dudley, what do you want?
L181843	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Call me Dudley.
L181842	u4991	m332	BUD	Captain, what do you want?
L181841	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
L181840	u4991	m332	BUD	Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
L181839	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
L181838	u4991	m332	BUD	This business, Captain?
L181837	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Lad, may I have a word with you?
L181918	u5007	m332	STENSLAND	It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
L181917	u4991	m332	BUD	What are you talking about?
L181916	u5007	m332	STENSLAND	No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
L181915	u4991	m332	BUD	What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
L181914	u5007	m332	STENSLAND	Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
L181913	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
L181912	u5007	m332	STENSLAND	Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
L181756	u4991	m332	BUD	I got to write my report first.
L181755	u5007	m332	STENSLAND	Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
L181722	u5007	m332	STENSLAND	Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
L181721	u4991	m332	BUD	You know him?
L182323	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah.  A great big one.
L182322	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	Was it... a rat?
L182320	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
L182319	u4991	m332	BUD	Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
L182318	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
L182317	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	No!  Please leave!
L182316	u4991	m332	BUD	What's through here?
L182314	u4991	m332	BUD	You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
L182313	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	That's him.  That's him.
L182312	u4991	m332	BUD	Look at a picture for me.
L182311	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	Maybe.  I don't know.
L182310	u4991	m332	BUD	Stens?  Was it Stens?
L182309	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
L182308	u4991	m332	BUD	What was that boyfriend's name?
L182307	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
L182306	u4991	m332	BUD	Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
L182305	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
L182304	u4991	m332	BUD	Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
L182303	u4991	m332	BUD	Five minutes.  That's all.
L182302	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	Let my daughter rest in peace.
L182301	u4991	m332	BUD	Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
L182649	u4991	m332	BUD	I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
L182648	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
L182647	u4991	m332	BUD	A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
L182646	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
L182642	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
L182641	u4991	m332	BUD	You wanted to meet here?
L182625	u4997	m332	EXLEY	We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
L182624	u4991	m332	BUD	They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
L182618	u4991	m332	BUD	If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
L182617	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Bud...
L182599	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
L182598	u4991	m332	BUD	What about him?
L182597	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Ellis Loew.
L182590	u4991	m332	BUD	<u>Lynn</u>.
L182589	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
L182588	u4991	m332	BUD	At least not anymore.
L182587	u4997	m332	EXLEY	We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
L182586	u4991	m332	BUD	He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
L182585	u4997	m332	EXLEY	It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
L182581	u4991	m332	BUD	Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
L182580	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You expecting problems?
L182579	u4991	m332	BUD	Which one are you and which one am I?
L182578	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
L182577	u4997	m332	EXLEY	With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
L182576	u4991	m332	BUD	There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
L182575	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
L182574	u4991	m332	BUD	For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
L182573	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What?
L182572	u4991	m332	BUD	Let's just kill them.
L182571	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
L182570	u4997	m332	EXLEY	It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
L182569	u4991	m332	BUD	It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
L182568	u4997	m332	EXLEY	They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
L182567	u4991	m332	BUD	Dudley's guys.
L182566	u4997	m332	EXLEY	The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
L182565	u4991	m332	BUD	Dudley.
L182564	u4997	m332	EXLEY	It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
L182563	u4991	m332	BUD	Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
L182562	u4997	m332	EXLEY	The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
L182561	u4991	m332	BUD	Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
L182560	u4997	m332	EXLEY	<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
L182559	u4991	m332	BUD	Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
L182558	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
L182557	u4991	m332	BUD	I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
L182552	u4997	m332	EXLEY	She told you?
L182551	u4991	m332	BUD	Lynn.
L182550	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Why?
L182172	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
L182171	u4991	m332	BUD	It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
L182170	u4997	m332	EXLEY	How's it going to look on your report?
L182169	u4991	m332	BUD	Get the fuck away from me.
L182168	u4997	m332	EXLEY	A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
L182161	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Officer White, put down that weapon and --
L182160	u4991	m332	BUD	One in six.  Where's the girl?
L181954	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
L181953	u4991	m332	BUD	What happened?
L181952	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
L181951	u4991	m332	BUD	Yeah, that's Stens.
L181947	u4997	m332	EXLEY	It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
L181946	u4991	m332	BUD	Where are we going?
L182015	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
L182014	u4991	m332	BUD	I got her address.
L182013	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
L182012	u4991	m332	BUD	That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
L182011	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
L182010	u4991	m332	BUD	What little studio?
L182009	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
L182008	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Wait.  Our deal still holds?
L182007	u4991	m332	BUD	You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
L182006	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
L182005	u4991	m332	BUD	Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
L182004	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
L182003	u4991	m332	BUD	That's right.
L182002	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
L182001	u4991	m332	BUD	No.
L182000	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
L181999	u4991	m332	BUD	I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
L181998	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Against your code?
L181997	u4991	m332	BUD	Thanks, but no thanks.
L181996	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
L181995	u4991	m332	BUD	Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
L181992	u4991	m332	BUD	Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
L181991	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Of course...
L181990	u4991	m332	BUD	We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
L181989	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
L181988	u4991	m332	BUD	Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
L181987	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	I don't know him.  Mr...
L181986	u4991	m332	BUD	Richard Stensland.
L181985	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
L181984	u4991	m332	BUD	I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
L181983	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
L181982	u4991	m332	BUD	Are you Pierce Patchett?
L181714	u4991	m332	BUD	I'm not asking you.
L181713	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	She's fine.
L182386	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	I don't know.  I swear it!
L182385	u4991	m332	BUD	He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
L182384	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
L182383	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
L182382	u4991	m332	BUD	Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
L182381	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
L182380	u4991	m332	BUD	How 'bout I give you your balls back?
L182379	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	More's gonna cost you.
L182378	u4991	m332	BUD	More.
L182377	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
L182376	u4991	m332	BUD	His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
L182375	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Should I?
L182374	u4991	m332	BUD	You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
L182373	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
L182372	u4991	m332	BUD	I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
L182371	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
L181654	u4991	m332	BUD	And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
L181653	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
L182300	u5005	m332	PINKER	Yeah, so...
L182299	u4991	m332	BUD	It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
L182298	u5005	m332	PINKER	What do you mean?
L182297	u4991	m332	BUD	It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
L182296	u5005	m332	PINKER	Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
L182295	u4991	m332	BUD	<u>Ear plugs</u>.
L182294	u5005	m332	PINKER	Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
L182292	u5005	m332	PINKER	Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
L182291	u4991	m332	BUD	But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
L182290	u5005	m332	PINKER	It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
L182289	u4991	m332	BUD	If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
L182288	u5005	m332	PINKER	Susan Lefferts.
L182287	u4991	m332	BUD	Whose shoe?
L182286	u5005	m332	PINKER	You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
L182285	u4991	m332	BUD	Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
L182284	u5005	m332	PINKER	What do you want to know?
L182283	u4991	m332	BUD	I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
L182282	u5005	m332	PINKER	I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
L182281	u4991	m332	BUD	I got a few Nite Owl questions.
L182280	u5005	m332	PINKER	Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
L181805	u4992	m332	CHIEF	All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
L181804	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
L181801	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
L181800	u4992	m332	CHIEF	Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
L181798	u4992	m332	CHIEF	And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
L181797	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
L181796	u4992	m332	CHIEF	I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
L181792	u4997	m332	EXLEY	The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
L181791	u4992	m332	CHIEF	Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
L182537	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Just show me where they are!
L182536	u4993	m332	CLERK	I don't have time.  I have --
L182535	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Where are the police academy files?
L182534	u4993	m332	CLERK	Someone must've pulled the records.
L182533	u4997	m332	EXLEY	So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
L182532	u4993	m332	CLERK	Nothing.
L182531	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Anything?
L182276	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Until he gunned down six people.
L182275	u4993	m332	CLERK	More or less.
L182274	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Clean?
L182273	u4993	m332	CLERK	I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
L182134	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
L182133	u4994	m332	COATES	Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
L182132	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
L182131	u4994	m332	COATES	I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
L182130	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
L182129	u4994	m332	COATES	Say what?
L182128	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
L182127	u4994	m332	COATES	I don't own no shotguns.
L182126	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Ray, we got the shotguns.
L182125	u4994	m332	COATES	Man, what're you saying?
L182124	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
L182123	u4994	m332	COATES	Dogs got no reason to live.
L182122	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I heard you like to shoot dogs.
L182121	u4994	m332	COATES	You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
L182120	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
L182117	u4994	m332	COATES	Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
L182116	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
L182115	u4994	m332	COATES	Believed what?
L182114	u4997	m332	EXLEY	That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
L182113	u4994	m332	COATES	I never truck with no sissies!
L182112	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
L182111	u4994	m332	COATES	Man, why do you keep asking me that?
L182110	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
L182109	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Did one of the officers work you over a little?
L182108	u4994	m332	COATES	Say what and so what.
L182107	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
L181886	u4995	m332	COHEN	Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
L181885	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Gone.  Not a trace.
L181884	u4995	m332	COHEN	And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
L181883	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	Nobody.  At least not yet.
L181882	u4995	m332	COHEN	I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
L181881	u5008	m332	STOMPANATO	They shot him in his library.
L181880	u4995	m332	COHEN	What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
L182523	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
L182522	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	And?
L182521	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
L182520	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
L182519	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	And what?
L182518	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	And?
L182517	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
L182514	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
L182513	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
L182512	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	What does that have to do --
L182511	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	But you were business associates?
L182510	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
L182509	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
L182508	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
L182507	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
L182506	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
L182666	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
L182665	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Something like that.
L182664	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
L182663	u4997	m332	EXLEY	<u>No</u>.
L182659	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
L182658	u4997	m332	EXLEY	And now you'll provide them.
L182657	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
L182656	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Why?
L182655	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
L182654	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
L182653	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
L182494	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
L182493	u4997	m332	EXLEY	No... Where'd the tip come from?
L182190	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
L182189	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
L182188	u4997	m332	EXLEY	There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
L182150	u4997	m332	EXLEY	She may still be alive, whoever she is.
L182149	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
L182103	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I'll break them, sir.
L182102	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Ed, I want confessions.
L181932	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Get on it.
L181931	u4997	m332	EXLEY	We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
L181930	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Why?
L181927	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
L181926	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Yes, I do, sir.
L181925	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
L181924	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
L181910	u4997	m332	EXLEY	His blood's always up.
L181909	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
L181808	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	So be it.
L181807	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Yes, Dudley.  I am.
L181806	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
L181795	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
L181794	u4997	m332	EXLEY	White's a mindless thug.
L181793	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
L181754	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
L181753	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
L181752	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
L181751	u4997	m332	EXLEY	No.
L181750	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
L181749	u4997	m332	EXLEY	No.
L181748	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
L181747	u4997	m332	EXLEY	No.
L181746	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
L181745	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I... No.
L181744	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Answer yes or no.
L181743	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Dudley, we've been over this.
L181742	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
L181741	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You're wrong.
L181739	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I was thinking Detective Bureau.
L181738	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
L181737	u4997	m332	EXLEY	The youngest applicant by eight years.
L181736	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
L182488	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Not even with Exley?
L182487	u4999	m332	JACK	No.
L182486	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
L182485	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
L182484	u4999	m332	JACK	It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
L182483	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
L182482	u4999	m332	JACK	Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
L182481	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	What's this all about, lad?
L182480	u4999	m332	JACK	Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
L182479	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
L182478	u4999	m332	JACK	You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
L182477	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
L182476	u4999	m332	JACK	Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
L182475	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
L182105	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
L182104	u4999	m332	JACK	You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
L181817	u4999	m332	JACK	Okay.  I'll do it.
L181816	u4996	m332	DUDLEY	John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
L182431	u4999	m332	JACK	Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
L182430	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
L182429	u4999	m332	JACK	What are you going to do?
L182409	u4999	m332	JACK	She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
L182408	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What?
L182407	u4999	m332	JACK	She is Lana Turner.
L182395	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
L182394	u4999	m332	JACK	High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
L182393	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What's Fleur-de-Lis?
L182392	u4999	m332	JACK	Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
L182391	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
L182390	u4999	m332	JACK	Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
L182389	u4999	m332	JACK	Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
L182388	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What's that for?
L182370	u4997	m332	EXLEY	A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
L182369	u4999	m332	JACK	Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
L182368	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I want to do it right.
L182367	u4999	m332	JACK	The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
L182366	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
L182365	u4999	m332	JACK	I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
L182363	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
L182362	u4999	m332	JACK	So what's the point?
L182361	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
L182360	u4999	m332	JACK	Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
L182358	u4999	m332	JACK	You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
L182357	u4997	m332	EXLEY	It's a simple question.
L182356	u4999	m332	JACK	What?
L182355	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
L182354	u4999	m332	JACK	I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
L182353	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
L182352	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah.  My whole life.
L182351	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You make a mistake?
L182350	u4999	m332	JACK	Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
L182349	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
L182348	u4999	m332	JACK	Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
L182347	u4997	m332	EXLEY	It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
L182346	u4999	m332	JACK	Even I'm not that crazy.
L182345	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I want you to follow Bud White.
L182344	u4999	m332	JACK	Damnit... <u>What</u>?
L182343	u4999	m332	JACK	Give me a minute, will ya?
L182342	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I need to speak to you.
L182097	u4999	m332	JACK	Just don't shoot me.
L182096	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Glasses.
L182095	u4999	m332	JACK	What?
L182094	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Damnit...
L182085	u4999	m332	JACK	<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
L182084	u4997	m332	EXLEY	L.A.P.D.
L181829	u4999	m332	JACK	I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
L181828	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What about you?
L181827	u4999	m332	JACK	You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
L181826	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
L181825	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
L181824	u4997	m332	EXLEY	<u>Throwing me</u>?
L181823	u4999	m332	JACK	I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
L181822	u4997	m332	EXLEY	That's right.
L181821	u4999	m332	JACK	You're the key witness?
L181697	u5010	m332	YOUNG OFFICER	Of his penis, sir?
L181696	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I get the idea.  You got a description?
L181695	u5010	m332	YOUNG OFFICER	With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
L181694	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Decorated?
L181693	u5010	m332	YOUNG OFFICER	A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
L181692	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What's on the call sheet?
L182505	u5005	m332	PINKER	I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
L182504	u4997	m332	EXLEY	We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
L182329	u5005	m332	PINKER	Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
L182328	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What are you talking about?
L182327	u5005	m332	PINKER	Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
L182326	u4997	m332	EXLEY	The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
L181929	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
L181928	u5005	m332	PINKER	We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
L182424	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
L182423	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Not good enough.
L182422	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	No.
L182421	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
L182420	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Why do men and women usually see each other?
L182419	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Why's she seeing Bud White?
L182418	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	Lynn Bracken.
L182417	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What's her name?
L182416	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	A vulgar term, but yes.
L182415	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
L182414	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
L182413	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Bud White's been here?
L182412	u5004	m332	PATCHETT	I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
L182687	u5001	m332	LYNN	Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
L182686	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
L182681	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Where is he?
L182680	u5001	m332	LYNN	Right now, before I back down.
L182679	u4997	m332	EXLEY	When?
L182678	u5001	m332	LYNN	Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
L182677	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Where will you go?
L182633	u5001	m332	LYNN	I know how he feels.
L182632	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
L182631	u5001	m332	LYNN	I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
L182630	u4997	m332	EXLEY	A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
L182629	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
L182628	u5001	m332	LYNN	If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
L182474	u5001	m332	LYNN	Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
L182473	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You, me and White, huh?
L182472	u5001	m332	LYNN	Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
L182471	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You're the first person to ever call me tough.
L182470	u5001	m332	LYNN	You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
L182469	u5001	m332	LYNN	Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
L182468	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Why not?
L182467	u5001	m332	LYNN	No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
L182466	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Some reality.
L182465	u5001	m332	LYNN	I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
L182464	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
L182463	u5001	m332	LYNN	You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
L182462	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
L182461	u5001	m332	LYNN	Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
L182460	u5001	m332	LYNN	I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
L182459	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I'll take your word for it.
L182458	u5001	m332	LYNN	I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
L182457	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
L182456	u5001	m332	LYNN	You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
L182455	u4997	m332	EXLEY	How about White?
L182454	u5001	m332	LYNN	The silver screen's loss is your gain.
L182453	u4997	m332	EXLEY	You sound like you mean it.
L182452	u5001	m332	LYNN	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
L182451	u4997	m332	EXLEY	How was I?
L182445	u5001	m332	LYNN	The way you've underestimated Bud White?
L182444	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
L182443	u5001	m332	LYNN	It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
L182441	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Why?
L182440	u5001	m332	LYNN	I'm curious about you.
L182438	u5001	m332	LYNN	He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
L182437	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
L182436	u5001	m332	LYNN	He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
L182435	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Really?  What did White say?
L182434	u5001	m332	LYNN	I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
L182433	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
L182620	u4997	m332	EXLEY	What's Dudley's scheme?
L182619	u5000	m332	LOEW	Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
L182611	u5000	m332	LOEW	I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
L182610	u4997	m332	EXLEY	The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
L182609	u5000	m332	LOEW	Do you have any proof?
L182608	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
L182607	u5000	m332	LOEW	Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
L182606	u4997	m332	EXLEY	None.  Call it a hunch.
L182605	u5000	m332	LOEW	On what evidence?
L182604	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
L182603	u5000	m332	LOEW	It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
L182338	u4997	m332	EXLEY	I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
L182337	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	My daughter was a virgin!
L182336	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
L182335	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Under the house.
L182334	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	A sweet man.
L182333	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Officer White?
L182332	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
L182331	u4997	m332	EXLEY	Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
L182330	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	Let my Susie rest in peace!
L181961	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
L181960	u4997	m332	EXLEY	When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
L181959	u5002	m332	MRS. LEFFERTS	It seems like my Susan, but...
L182257	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
L182256	u4999	m332	JACK	Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
L182255	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
L182254	u4999	m332	JACK	He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
L182253	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
L182252	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	What happened with the kid and Loew?
L182251	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	What's wrong, Trash?
L182250	u4999	m332	JACK	Shut up!
L182249	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
L182248	u4999	m332	JACK	Sid, cut the crap.  I --
L182247	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
L182228	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
L182227	u4999	m332	JACK	Around.
L182226	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Where'd you hear that?
L182225	u4999	m332	JACK	Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
L182204	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
L182203	u4999	m332	JACK	And Reynolds?
L182202	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
L182201	u4999	m332	JACK	Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
L182200	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	You tight with the D.A., trash?
L182199	u4999	m332	JACK	What's he doing here, Sid?
L182198	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
L182196	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Down around my ankles.
L182195	u4999	m332	JACK	Sid, how are they hanging?
L182194	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	You're back, boychick.
L181906	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
L181905	u4999	m332	JACK	What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
L181904	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Not a word.
L181903	u4999	m332	JACK	Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
L181902	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Something good?
L181901	u4999	m332	JACK	No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
L181900	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
L181899	u4999	m332	JACK	Sid, it's Vincennes.
L181898	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
L181690	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah, it's subtle.
L181689	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
L181686	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	I like it!  I like it!
L181685	u4999	m332	JACK	Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
L181684	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
L181683	u4999	m332	JACK	No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
L181682	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Jack!  It's Christmas!
L181681	u4999	m332	JACK	I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
L181680	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
L181679	u4999	m332	JACK	You lost me, Sid.  Who?
L181678	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
L181677	u4999	m332	JACK	Is she?
L181676	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
L181674	u4999	m332	JACK	Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
L181673	u4998	m332	HUDGEONS	Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
L182341	u5003	m332	OPERATOR	Please hold, Sergeant...
L182340	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
L181769	u4999	m332	JACK	A bootleg...
L181768	u5003	m332	OPERATOR	No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
L181767	u4999	m332	JACK	I just called it.
L181766	u5003	m332	OPERATOR	Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
L181765	u4999	m332	JACK	This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
L181764	u5003	m332	OPERATOR	Pacific Coast Bell.
L182235	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	Showbiz.
L182234	u4999	m332	JACK	It'll be our secret.
L182233	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	And no one'll know about this?
L182232	u4999	m332	JACK	I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
L182219	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah.  Me neither.
L182218	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
L182217	u4999	m332	JACK	Really?  How?
L182216	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
L182215	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
L182214	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
L182213	u4999	m332	JACK	Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
L182212	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
L182211	u4999	m332	JACK	Something like that.
L182210	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	Was it a party?
L182209	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah.
L182208	u5006	m332	REYNOLDS	Have we met before?
L181894	u5009	m332	VICE CAPTAIN	Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
L181893	u4999	m332	JACK	Working whores with squad two.
L181892	u5009	m332	VICE CAPTAIN	Oh?  Anyplace else?
L181891	u4999	m332	JACK	Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
L181890	u5009	m332	VICE CAPTAIN	Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
L181889	u4999	m332	JACK	Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
L213163	u5256	m348	ANGEL FACE	He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
L213162	u5262	m348	JACK	No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
L213161	u5256	m348	ANGEL FACE	He was killed in action.
L213160	u5262	m348	JACK	Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
L213158	u5256	m348	ANGEL FACE	The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
L213157	u5262	m348	JACK	What... ?
L213135	u5262	m348	JACK	Right, right.
L213134	u5256	m348	ANGEL FACE	The first rule of Project --
L213133	u5262	m348	JACK	Where's Tyler?
L213132	u5256	m348	ANGEL FACE	That wouldn't interest you.
L213202	u5257	m348	BANDAGED PROPRIETOR	I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
L213201	u5262	m348	JACK	You are a moron.
L213200	u5257	m348	BANDAGED PROPRIETOR	I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
L213199	u5262	m348	JACK	Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
L213198	u5257	m348	BANDAGED PROPRIETOR	I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
L213197	u5262	m348	JACK	There's no one else here.
L213196	u5257	m348	BANDAGED PROPRIETOR	Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
L213195	u5262	m348	JACK	I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
L212873	u5258	m348	BOB	You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden?
L212872	u5262	m348	JACK	Yeah, both of us.
L212871	u5258	m348	BOB	That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
L212870	u5262	m348	JACK	Look at my face.
L212869	u5258	m348	BOB	You are?!
L212868	u5262	m348	JACK	Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
L212867	u5258	m348	BOB	And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
L212866	u5262	m348	JACK	Oh.
L212865	u5258	m348	BOB	The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
L212864	u5262	m348	JACK	Really, what's that?
L212863	u5258	m348	BOB	No.  I found something new.
L212862	u5262	m348	JACK	"Really?  Great.  Still ""Remaining Men Together?"""
L212861	u5258	m348	BOB	Better than I've ever been in my life.
L212860	u5262	m348	JACK	Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
L212859	u5258	m348	BOB	Cornelius!  How are you?
L212266	u5262	m348	JACK	Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
L212265	u5258	m348	BOB	...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
L212264	u5262	m348	JACK	Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
L212227	u5258	m348	BOB	They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
L212226	u5262	m348	JACK	Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
L212225	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
L212224	u5258	m348	BOB	We're still men.
L212223	u5262	m348	JACK	This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
L212888	u5262	m348	JACK	What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
L212887	u5259	m348	BOSS	Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
L212886	u5262	m348	JACK	Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
L212885	u5262	m348	JACK	I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
L212884	u5259	m348	BOSS	Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
L212883	u5262	m348	JACK	We need to talk.
L212822	u5259	m348	BOSS	Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
L212821	u5262	m348	JACK	Abuse the copy machine.  There's an image.
L212820	u5259	m348	BOSS	You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
L212819	u5262	m348	JACK	Hmm?
L212818	u5259	m348	BOSS	"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
L212817	u5262	m348	JACK	I must've left the original in the copy machine.
L212725	u5262	m348	JACK	Some of it, yes.
L212724	u5259	m348	BOSS	Is that your blood?
L212610	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes.
L212609	u5259	m348	BOSS	Have you finished those reports?
L212608	u5262	m348	JACK	After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
L212238	u5259	m348	BOSS	Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
L212237	u5262	m348	JACK	He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
L212236	u5259	m348	BOSS	You need to make these your primary action items."""
L212235	u5262	m348	JACK	You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
L212234	u5262	m348	JACK	"It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his ""cornflower-blue"" tie."
L212233	u5259	m348	BOSS	"I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some ""red-flags"" to cover."
L212757	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
L212756	u5262	m348	JACK	I'd like to thank the academy...
L212755	u5262	m348	JACK	No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
L212748	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	I'll ask the questions, son.
L212747	u5262	m348	JACK	Who do you think could've done this?
L212746	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
L212745	u5262	m348	JACK	This is... really a shock...
L212744	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	It means it was homemade.
L212743	u5262	m348	JACK	What does that mean?
L212742	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
L212741	u5262	m348	JACK	Dynamite?
L212740	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	The dynamite...
L212739	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
L212738	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	Does this sound strange to you?
L212737	u5262	m348	JACK	I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
L212736	u5262	m348	JACK	No, I wasn't aware...
L212735	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
L212734	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes?
L212733	u5260	m348	DETECTIVE STERN	"This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the ""incident"" at your condo."
L212255	u5261	m348	INTERN	You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
L212254	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm in pain.
L212253	u5261	m348	INTERN	You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
L212252	u5262	m348	JACK	Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
L212251	u5262	m348	JACK	Can't you give me something?
L212250	u5261	m348	INTERN	You need to lighten up.
L212249	u5262	m348	JACK	Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
L212248	u5261	m348	INTERN	No, you can't die of insomnia.
L213510	u5262	m348	JACK	I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
L213509	u5265	m348	MARLA	Who did this to you?
L213508	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes.
L213507	u5265	m348	MARLA	My God, you're shot...
L213505	u5262	m348	JACK	Don't ask.
L213504	u5265	m348	MARLA	What happened... ?
L213362	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
L213361	u5265	m348	MARLA	"I'm not paying this back.  I consider it ""asshole tax."""
L213360	u5262	m348	JACK	I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
L213359	u5265	m348	MARLA	Why are you doing this?
L213358	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
L213357	u5265	m348	MARLA	Tyler...
L213355	u5262	m348	JACK	Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
L213354	u5265	m348	MARLA	Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
L213353	u5262	m348	JACK	Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
L213352	u5265	m348	MARLA	Let go of me!
L213350	u5265	m348	MARLA	What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
L213349	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm sorry, but I...
L213348	u5265	m348	MARLA	There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
L213347	u5265	m348	MARLA	No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
L213346	u5262	m348	JACK	Marla...
L213345	u5265	m348	MARLA	You are an insane person.
L213344	u5262	m348	JACK	You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
L213343	u5265	m348	MARLA	What?
L213342	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
L213340	u5265	m348	MARLA	Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
L213339	u5262	m348	JACK	I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
L213338	u5265	m348	MARLA	What?
L213337	u5262	m348	JACK	I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
L213336	u5265	m348	MARLA	Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
L213335	u5262	m348	JACK	I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
L213334	u5265	m348	MARLA	You got about thirty seconds.
L213330	u5265	m348	MARLA	Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
L213329	u5262	m348	JACK	Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
L213326	u5265	m348	MARLA	I've done you enough favors.
L213325	u5262	m348	JACK	Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
L213324	u5265	m348	MARLA	Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
L213323	u5262	m348	JACK	Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
L213322	u5265	m348	MARLA	I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
L213320	u5265	m348	MARLA	Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
L213319	u5262	m348	JACK	Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
L213318	u5265	m348	MARLA	The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
L213317	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm sorry, I...
L213316	u5265	m348	MARLA	Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
L213315	u5262	m348	JACK	Marla...
L213244	u5262	m348	JACK	Marla, no, wait...
L213243	u5265	m348	MARLA	Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
L213242	u5262	m348	JACK	Say my name!  What's my name!?
L213241	u5265	m348	MARLA	What... ?
L213240	u5262	m348	JACK	Say my name.
L213239	u5265	m348	MARLA	What is wrong with you?
L213238	u5262	m348	JACK	What did you say... ?
L213237	u5262	m348	JACK	We've just lost cabin pressure.
L213236	u5265	m348	MARLA	You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
L213235	u5262	m348	JACK	Answer the question!
L213234	u5265	m348	MARLA	Is that what you're calling it?
L213233	u5262	m348	JACK	We did make love?
L213232	u5265	m348	MARLA	You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
L213231	u5262	m348	JACK	Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
L213230	u5265	m348	MARLA	Is this a trick?
L213229	u5262	m348	JACK	"Because the answer's ""yes"" or because the answer's ""no?"""
L213228	u5265	m348	MARLA	What kind of stupid question is that?!
L213227	u5262	m348	JACK	Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
L213226	u5265	m348	MARLA	Yeah?
L213143	u5262	m348	JACK	He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
L213142	u5265	m348	MARLA	What?
L213141	u5262	m348	JACK	He's not here.
L213140	u5265	m348	MARLA	Can I come in?
L213139	u5262	m348	JACK	The Paper Street Soap Company.
L213099	u5265	m348	MARLA	You're afraid to say.
L213098	u5262	m348	JACK	Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
L213097	u5265	m348	MARLA	Why would you get bent if I asked?
L213096	u5262	m348	JACK	Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
L213095	u5265	m348	MARLA	Guy or girl?
L213094	u5262	m348	JACK	... A person.
L213093	u5265	m348	MARLA	What is this?  Who did this?
L213085	u5265	m348	MARLA	That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
L213084	u5262	m348	JACK	No.
L213082	u5265	m348	MARLA	Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
L213081	u5262	m348	JACK	That... sawing and hammering.
L213080	u5265	m348	MARLA	Hear what?
L213079	u5262	m348	JACK	You hear that?
L213078	u5265	m348	MARLA	What do you get out of it?
L213077	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
L213074	u5265	m348	MARLA	It was the smart move on her part.
L213073	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't know.
L213072	u5265	m348	MARLA	Do you care?
L213071	u5262	m348	JACK	When?
L213070	u5265	m348	MARLA	Chloe's dead.
L213069	u5262	m348	JACK	Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
L213068	u5265	m348	MARLA	Whatever.
L213067	u5262	m348	JACK	You... don't have to... leave.
L212856	u5265	m348	MARLA	Well... thanks, anyway.
L212855	u5262	m348	JACK	Uh ... nah.
L212854	u5265	m348	MARLA	I could check your prostate.
L212853	u5262	m348	JACK	I think everything's okay here.
L212852	u5265	m348	MARLA	I wish I could return the favor.
L212851	u5262	m348	JACK	No... no problem.
L212850	u5265	m348	MARLA	Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
L212849	u5262	m348	JACK	Nothing.
L212848	u5265	m348	MARLA	You feel nothing?
L212847	u5262	m348	JACK	Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
L212846	u5265	m348	MARLA	Make sure.
L212845	u5262	m348	JACK	No.
L212844	u5265	m348	MARLA	Feel anything?
L212843	u5262	m348	JACK	Here.
L212842	u5265	m348	MARLA	Here.
L212841	u5262	m348	JACK	There?
L212840	u5265	m348	MARLA	Here.
L212839	u5262	m348	JACK	Where?  Here?
L212836	u5265	m348	MARLA	Good.
L212835	u5262	m348	JACK	No, thanks.
L212834	u5265	m348	MARLA	Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
L212833	u5262	m348	JACK	"This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  ""Mrs. Haniver"" and... ""Mrs. Raines."" Where are they?"
L212832	u5262	m348	JACK	She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book.
L212831	u5265	m348	MARLA	Please.
L212830	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't know ...
L212829	u5265	m348	MARLA	Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
L212828	u5262	m348	JACK	What are you talking about?
L212775	u5262	m348	JACK	Goodbye.
L212774	u5265	m348	MARLA	You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
L212773	u5265	m348	MARLA	Don't worry, I'm leaving.
L212772	u5262	m348	JACK	It's time for you to leave.
L212765	u5262	m348	JACK	It suits you.
L212764	u5265	m348	MARLA	Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
L212761	u5262	m348	JACK	Worth every penny.
L212760	u5265	m348	MARLA	I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
L212759	u5262	m348	JACK	Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
L212668	u5262	m348	JACK	What the hell are you doing here?
L212667	u5265	m348	MARLA	What... ?
L212666	u5262	m348	JACK	What are you doing here?
L212661	u5265	m348	MARLA	Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
L212660	u5262	m348	JACK	So you're staying in tonight?
L212659	u5262	m348	JACK	This could go on for hours.
L212658	u5265	m348	MARLA	This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
L212657	u5262	m348	JACK	Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
L212656	u5265	m348	MARLA	Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
L212655	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm just on my way out...
L212654	u5265	m348	MARLA	I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
L212653	u5262	m348	JACK	Look, this is a bad time...
L212652	u5265	m348	MARLA	Like testicular cancer?
L212651	u5262	m348	JACK	It's for men.
L212650	u5265	m348	MARLA	Really?
L212649	u5262	m348	JACK	I found a new one.
L212648	u5265	m348	MARLA	You haven't been going to yours.
L212647	u5262	m348	JACK	That's the idea -- we split them.
L212646	u5265	m348	MARLA	The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
L212645	u5262	m348	JACK	How did you find me?
L212644	u5262	m348	JACK	Marla?
L212643	u5265	m348	MARLA	Where have you been the last few weeks?
L212371	u5265	m348	MARLA	I suppose.
L212370	u5262	m348	JACK	In case we want to switch nights.
L212369	u5265	m348	MARLA	Should we?
L212368	u5262	m348	JACK	Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
L212366	u5262	m348	JACK	Let's not make a big thing out of it.
L212365	u5265	m348	MARLA	Looks like this is goodbye.
L212364	u5265	m348	MARLA	Deal.
L212363	u5262	m348	JACK	We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
L212362	u5265	m348	MARLA	That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
L212360	u5262	m348	JACK	The girl had done her homework.
L212359	u5265	m348	MARLA	So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
L212355	u5262	m348	JACK	Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
L212354	u5265	m348	MARLA	So far, you have four and I only have two!
L212353	u5262	m348	JACK	You can't have the whole brain!
L212352	u5265	m348	MARLA	I want that.
L212351	u5262	m348	JACK	Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
L212350	u5265	m348	MARLA	I want brain parasites.
L212349	u5262	m348	JACK	You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
L212348	u5265	m348	MARLA	I'll take the parasites.
L212347	u5265	m348	MARLA	I don't know -- am I?
L212346	u5262	m348	JACK	You're kidding.
L212345	u5265	m348	MARLA	Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
L212344	u5262	m348	JACK	I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
L212343	u5265	m348	MARLA	You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
L212342	u5262	m348	JACK	We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
L212340	u5262	m348	JACK	Please.  Can't we do something... ?
L212339	u5265	m348	MARLA	Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
L212338	u5262	m348	JACK	Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
L212337	u5265	m348	MARLA	Really?
L212336	u5262	m348	JACK	It becomes an addiction.
L212334	u5262	m348	JACK	Yeah.
L212333	u5265	m348	MARLA	-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
L212332	u5262	m348	JACK	I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
L212329	u5262	m348	JACK	Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
L212328	u5265	m348	MARLA	A year?  How'd you manage that?
L212327	u5262	m348	JACK	These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
L212326	u5265	m348	MARLA	It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
L212325	u5262	m348	JACK	Why are you doing this?
L212323	u5265	m348	MARLA	Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
L212322	u5262	m348	JACK	I'll expose you.
L212321	u5265	m348	MARLA	"Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  ""... Mr. Taylor."""
L212320	u5262	m348	JACK	Practicing what?
L212319	u5265	m348	MARLA	And I saw you practicing this...
L212316	u5262	m348	JACK	Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
L212315	u5265	m348	MARLA	What?
L212314	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
L212313	u5265	m348	MARLA	Sure.
L212312	u5262	m348	JACK	We need to talk.
L212730	u5270	m348	TYLER'S VOICE	You fucking slut!!
L212729	u5262	m348	JACK	... and you come home to this.
L212462	u5262	m348	JACK	Well... let me see... here's the thing...
L212461	u5270	m348	TYLER'S VOICE	I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
L212460	u5262	m348	JACK	I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
L212459	u5270	m348	TYLER'S VOICE	Oh, yeah.
L212458	u5262	m348	JACK	Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
L212457	u5270	m348	TYLER'S VOICE	Who's this?
L212456	u5262	m348	JACK	Tyler?
L212455	u5270	m348	TYLER'S VOICE	Who's this?
L212454	u5262	m348	JACK	Hello?
L213225	u5262	m348	JACK	Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
L213224	u5272	m348	WOUNDED BARTENDER	You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
L213223	u5272	m348	WOUNDED BARTENDER	Is this part of the test?
L213222	u5262	m348	JACK	Who do you think I am?
L213221	u5272	m348	WOUNDED BARTENDER	You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
L213220	u5262	m348	JACK	What?
L213219	u5272	m348	WOUNDED BARTENDER	You were in here last Thursday night.
L213218	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes... it's a test.
L213217	u5272	m348	WOUNDED BARTENDER	Is this a test, sir?
L213216	u5262	m348	JACK	... You know me?
L213215	u5272	m348	WOUNDED BARTENDER	How have you been?
L212438	u5268	m348	SECURITY TFM	Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
L212437	u5262	m348	JACK	I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
L212436	u5268	m348	SECURITY TFM	"Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: ""A dildo.""  Never ""Your dildo."""
L212435	u5262	m348	JACK	My suitcase was vibrating?
L212434	u5268	m348	SECURITY TFM	Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
L212433	u5262	m348	JACK	"Excuse me?  ""Throwers?"""
L212432	u5268	m348	SECURITY TFM	Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
L212318	u5262	m348	JACK	You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
L212317	u5263	m348	LEADER	Tell the other person how you feel.
L212303	u5263	m348	LEADER	Now, find your power animal.
L212302	u5262	m348	JACK	If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
L212294	u5263	m348	LEADER	Okay, everyone.
L212293	u5262	m348	JACK	"-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said ""parasite;"" they said ""agent.""  They always talked about getting better."
L212275	u5263	m348	LEADER	...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
L212274	u5262	m348	JACK	I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
L212273	u5263	m348	LEADER	Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
L213496	u5262	m348	JACK	My eyes are open.
L213495	u5269	m348	TYLER	What?
L213494	u5262	m348	JACK	Look at me...
L213493	u5269	m348	TYLER	What?
L213492	u5262	m348	JACK	Appreciate something.
L213491	u5269	m348	TYLER	What?
L213490	u5262	m348	JACK	Do something for me.
L213488	u5262	m348	JACK	It's the only way to get rid of you...
L213487	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
L213485	u5262	m348	JACK	Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
L213484	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
L213483	u5262	m348	JACK	What have you left for me?
L213482	u5269	m348	TYLER	What are you doing?
L213480	u5269	m348	TYLER	You will.  You know you will.
L213479	u5262	m348	JACK	I swear on my life, I won't...
L213478	u5269	m348	TYLER	If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
L213477	u5262	m348	JACK	Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
L213476	u5269	m348	TYLER	I'm doing this for us.
L213475	u5262	m348	JACK	Why are you doing this?!
L213474	u5269	m348	TYLER	No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
L213473	u5262	m348	JACK	... no, no, no...
L213472	u5269	m348	TYLER	From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
L213471	u5262	m348	JACK	Noooo, please...
L213470	u5269	m348	TYLER	Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
L213469	u5262	m348	JACK	No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
L213468	u5269	m348	TYLER	You need me.
L213467	u5262	m348	JACK	Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
L213466	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why what?
L213465	u5262	m348	JACK	Why... why... why... ?
L213463	u5269	m348	TYLER	Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
L213462	u5262	m348	JACK	How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
L213460	u5269	m348	TYLER	Proceed with remote detonation.
L213459	u5262	m348	JACK	NO...
L213457	u5269	m348	TYLER	Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
L213456	u5262	m348	JACK	Not exactly according to plan.
L213455	u5269	m348	TYLER	Damn it!  God-damn it...
L213454	u5262	m348	JACK	Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
L213453	u5269	m348	TYLER	What?
L213452	u5262	m348	JACK	Paraffin.
L213451	u5269	m348	TYLER	What the fuck -- ?
L213449	u5269	m348	TYLER	Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
L213448	u5262	m348	JACK	Please...
L213447	u5269	m348	TYLER	It's out of our hands.  This is it.
L213446	u5262	m348	JACK	Can't you call it off... ?
L213442	u5262	m348	JACK	i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
L213441	u5269	m348	TYLER	This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
L213440	u5262	m348	JACK	I think this is about where we came in.
L213439	u5269	m348	TYLER	One minute.
L213433	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes.
L213432	u5269	m348	TYLER	Defuse the bomb?
L213431	u5262	m348	JACK	Defuse the bomb, please.
L213430	u5269	m348	TYLER	Ask me nicely.
L213429	u5262	m348	JACK	Defuse the bomb.
L213428	u5269	m348	TYLER	What?
L213427	u5262	m348	JACK	Tyler...
L213426	u5269	m348	TYLER	Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
L213425	u5262	m348	JACK	I quit.
L213424	u5269	m348	TYLER	You want out?
L213423	u5262	m348	JACK	Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
L213422	u5269	m348	TYLER	"Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project ""Mayhem."""
L213421	u5262	m348	JACK	Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
L213420	u5269	m348	TYLER	I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
L213416	u5269	m348	TYLER	I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
L213415	u5262	m348	JACK	Fuck you.
L213414	u5269	m348	TYLER	Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
L213413	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes...
L213412	u5269	m348	TYLER	Green?  Did you say green?
L213411	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm pulling the green wire.
L213410	u5269	m348	TYLER	This is not about martyrdom.
L213409	u5262	m348	JACK	If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
L213407	u5262	m348	JACK	If you know, I know.
L213406	u5269	m348	TYLER	I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
L213404	u5262	m348	JACK	You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
L213403	u5269	m348	TYLER	The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
L213402	u5262	m348	JACK	Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
L213401	u5269	m348	TYLER	What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
L213400	u5269	m348	TYLER	...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
L213399	u5262	m348	JACK	Stop finishing...
L213398	u5269	m348	TYLER	...to let this happen!
L213397	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm not going...
L213396	u5269	m348	TYLER	...stop me?
L213395	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm going to...
L213394	u5269	m348	TYLER	...go through with this? What are you going to do?
L213393	u5262	m348	JACK	I can't let you...
L213392	u5269	m348	TYLER	What a ridiculous thing to say.
L213391	u5262	m348	JACK	You... you can't be serious about this.
L213390	u5269	m348	TYLER	You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
L213288	u5269	m348	TYLER	Um, well... technically, no.
L213287	u5262	m348	JACK	She's... you... you're fucking her.
L213286	u5269	m348	TYLER	What about Marla?
L213285	u5262	m348	JACK	What about Marla?
L213284	u5269	m348	TYLER	Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
L213283	u5262	m348	JACK	You have jobs.
L213282	u5269	m348	TYLER	The house is rented in your name.
L213281	u5262	m348	JACK	You took me to the house.
L213280	u5269	m348	TYLER	What about them?  They're lunatics.
L213279	u5262	m348	JACK	Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
L213278	u5269	m348	TYLER	You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
L213277	u5262	m348	JACK	No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
L213276	u5269	m348	TYLER	It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
L213275	u5262	m348	JACK	What... what are you saying?
L213274	u5269	m348	TYLER	We're going to have to do something about Marla...
L213273	u5262	m348	JACK	This isn't possible...
L213272	u5269	m348	TYLER	There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
L213267	u5269	m348	TYLER	But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
L213266	u5262	m348	JACK	Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
L213264	u5269	m348	TYLER	You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
L213263	u5262	m348	JACK	He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
L213262	u5269	m348	TYLER	And, sometimes you control it...
L213261	u5262	m348	JACK	The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
L213260	u5269	m348	TYLER	Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
L213259	u5262	m348	JACK	What are you talking about... ?
L213258	u5269	m348	TYLER	Is this really news to you?
L213257	u5262	m348	JACK	What... ?
L213256	u5269	m348	TYLER	People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
L213255	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't know!  Tell me!
L213254	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why do people think anything?
L213253	u5262	m348	JACK	Answer me, Tyler.
L213252	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why did you do that?
L213251	u5262	m348	JACK	Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
L213250	u5269	m348	TYLER	You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
L213249	u5262	m348	JACK	Why do people think I'm you?
L213248	u5269	m348	TYLER	And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
L213247	u5262	m348	JACK	What's this all about, Tyler?
L213246	u5269	m348	TYLER	Four in Milwaukee.
L213108	u5262	m348	JACK	Training?  Tyler...
L213107	u5269	m348	TYLER	If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
L213106	u5262	m348	JACK	Applicant?
L213105	u5269	m348	TYLER	If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
L213104	u5262	m348	JACK	Too young?
L213103	u5262	m348	JACK	Wait a minute...
L213102	u5269	m348	TYLER	You're too young.  Sorry.
L213092	u5262	m348	JACK	... is over.
L213091	u5269	m348	TYLER	... is over.
L213090	u5262	m348	JACK	This conversation...
L213087	u5262	m348	JACK	Nothing.
L213086	u5269	m348	TYLER	What are you talking about?
L213060	u5269	m348	TYLER	Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
L213059	u5262	m348	JACK	What?
L213058	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why do you think I blew up your condo?
L213057	u5262	m348	JACK	Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
L213056	u5269	m348	TYLER	I want to hear the truth.
L213055	u5262	m348	JACK	I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
L213054	u5269	m348	TYLER	If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
L213053	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't know!  Nothing!
L213047	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't think that's true.
L213046	u5269	m348	TYLER	You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
L213045	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm not asking you to.
L213044	u5269	m348	TYLER	You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
L213043	u5262	m348	JACK	What the hell ... ?!
L213042	u5262	m348	JACK	Tyler...
L213041	u5269	m348	TYLER	We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
L213040	u5262	m348	JACK	What are you doing?!
L213039	u5269	m348	TYLER	This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
L213036	u5269	m348	TYLER	What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
L213035	u5262	m348	JACK	I want to know --
L213034	u5269	m348	TYLER	"Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your ""action item list?"""
L213033	u5262	m348	JACK	Look...
L213032	u5269	m348	TYLER	What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
L213031	u5262	m348	JACK	You know what I mean.
L213030	u5269	m348	TYLER	Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
L213027	u5269	m348	TYLER	Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
L213026	u5262	m348	JACK	Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
L213025	u5269	m348	TYLER	What should I have told you?
L213024	u5262	m348	JACK	"Why wasn't I told about ""Project Mayhem?"""
L213023	u5262	m348	JACK	No.
L213022	u5269	m348	TYLER	Something on your mind?
L213018	u5262	m348	JACK	I felt like destroying something beautiful.
L213017	u5269	m348	TYLER	Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
L212998	u5269	m348	TYLER	Hey.
L212997	u5262	m348	JACK	Hey.
L212990	u5269	m348	TYLER	Imagine how he feels.
L212989	u5262	m348	JACK	I feel sick.
L212973	u5262	m348	JACK	Tell him!
L212972	u5269	m348	TYLER	I asked you what you studied.
L212969	u5269	m348	TYLER	An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
L212968	u5262	m348	JACK	Tyler...
L212956	u5262	m348	JACK	What is it?
L212955	u5269	m348	TYLER	Homework assignment.
L212954	u5262	m348	JACK	What are we doing?
L212952	u5262	m348	JACK	I thought you did.
L212951	u5269	m348	TYLER	Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
L212950	u5262	m348	JACK	Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
L212949	u5269	m348	TYLER	I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
L212948	u5262	m348	JACK	There's fight club in Delaware City.
L212900	u5262	m348	JACK	Okay, and... and...
L212899	u5269	m348	TYLER	Fucking sweet.
L212898	u5262	m348	JACK	Six months advance pay.  Six months!
L212882	u5269	m348	TYLER	Nothing.  Do what you like.
L212881	u5262	m348	JACK	What... ?
L212880	u5262	m348	JACK	Work.  Going to work.
L212879	u5269	m348	TYLER	Yeah.  Where you headed?
L212878	u5262	m348	JACK	You quit?
L212877	u5269	m348	TYLER	No thanks, I quit.
L212810	u5269	m348	TYLER	Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
L212809	u5262	m348	JACK	... Marla ... ?
L212807	u5262	m348	JACK	We don't... ?
L212806	u5269	m348	TYLER	We don't need him...
L212805	u5262	m348	JACK	It isn't... ?
L212804	u5269	m348	TYLER	Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
L212803	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't know...
L212802	u5269	m348	TYLER	Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
L212801	u5262	m348	JACK	No, I'm not...
L212800	u5269	m348	TYLER	This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
L212799	u5269	m348	TYLER	No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
L212798	u5262	m348	JACK	I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
L212795	u5262	m348	JACK	I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
L212794	u5269	m348	TYLER	Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
L212791	u5262	m348	JACK	Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
L212790	u5269	m348	TYLER	Look at your hand.
L212789	u5262	m348	JACK	Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
L212784	u5269	m348	TYLER	This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
L212783	u5262	m348	JACK	Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
L212782	u5269	m348	TYLER	As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
L212780	u5269	m348	TYLER	A liposuction clinic.
L212779	u5262	m348	JACK	What is this place?
L212769	u5269	m348	TYLER	Don't mention me.
L212768	u5262	m348	JACK	You get rid of her.
L212752	u5262	m348	JACK	Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
L212751	u5269	m348	TYLER	The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception.
L212750	u5262	m348	JACK	Huh?
L212720	u5262	m348	JACK	Uh... nah...
L212719	u5269	m348	TYLER	You want to finish her off?
L212713	u5269	m348	TYLER	That was three times you promised.
L212712	u5262	m348	JACK	I said I promise!
L212711	u5269	m348	TYLER	Promise?
L212710	u5262	m348	JACK	Yes, I promise.
L212709	u5269	m348	TYLER	Promise you won't.
L212708	u5262	m348	JACK	Okay.
L212707	u5269	m348	TYLER	If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
L212706	u5269	m348	TYLER	You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
L212705	u5262	m348	JACK	What?
L212704	u5269	m348	TYLER	Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
L212703	u5262	m348	JACK	She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
L212702	u5269	m348	TYLER	She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
L212701	u5262	m348	JACK	Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
L212700	u5269	m348	TYLER	Hey... don't knock librarians.
L212699	u5262	m348	JACK	Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
L212698	u5269	m348	TYLER	She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
L212696	u5262	m348	JACK	I'm fine.
L212695	u5269	m348	TYLER	You're okay with this?
L212692	u5269	m348	TYLER	Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
L212691	u5262	m348	JACK	Yeah, I'm sure.
L212690	u5269	m348	TYLER	You're sure?
L212688	u5262	m348	JACK	No.  Not at all.
L212687	u5269	m348	TYLER	I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
L212686	u5262	m348	JACK	He was obviously able to handle it.
L212685	u5269	m348	TYLER	Unbelievable, huh?
L212640	u5269	m348	TYLER	Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
L212639	u5262	m348	JACK	You?
L212638	u5269	m348	TYLER	Good answer.
L212637	u5262	m348	JACK	Okay... Ghandi.
L212636	u5269	m348	TYLER	Any historical figure.
L212635	u5262	m348	JACK	Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
L212618	u5262	m348	JACK	Shatner.  William Shatner.
L212617	u5269	m348	TYLER	Hemingway.  You?
L212616	u5262	m348	JACK	Doesn't matter.
L212615	u5269	m348	TYLER	Alive or dead?
L212614	u5262	m348	JACK	If you could fight any celebrity?
L212613	u5262	m348	JACK	A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
L212578	u5262	m348	JACK	Show-off.
L212577	u5269	m348	TYLER	Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
L212576	u5262	m348	JACK	What are you reading?
L212575	u5269	m348	TYLER	I get cancer, and I kill Joe.
L212574	u5262	m348	JACK	"I am Joe's Lungs.  It's written in first person.  ""Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells.""  There's a whole series -- ""I am Joe's Prostate."""
L212573	u5269	m348	TYLER	"Oh, a new riot control grenade...  ""...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."""
L212572	u5262	m348	JACK	What?
L212571	u5269	m348	TYLER	Hum.
L212570	u5262	m348	JACK	The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
L212562	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
L212561	u5269	m348	TYLER	What car?
L212560	u5262	m348	JACK	Where's your car?
L212558	u5269	m348	TYLER	A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
L212557	u5262	m348	JACK	Same here.
L212556	u5269	m348	TYLER	"After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, ""Now what?""  He said, ""Get a job.""  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, ""Now what?""  He said, ""I don't know. Get married."""
L212555	u5262	m348	JACK	I know that.
L212554	u5269	m348	TYLER	He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
L212553	u5262	m348	JACK	Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
L212552	u5269	m348	TYLER	My dad.  No question.
L212551	u5262	m348	JACK	My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
L212550	u5269	m348	TYLER	Anyone.
L212549	u5262	m348	JACK	Anyone?
L212548	u5269	m348	TYLER	If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
L212547	u5269	m348	TYLER	This fight, pussy.
L212546	u5262	m348	JACK	What fight?
L212545	u5269	m348	TYLER	The fight.
L212544	u5262	m348	JACK	Call what off?
L212543	u5269	m348	TYLER	We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
L212542	u5262	m348	JACK	Is it?
L212541	u5269	m348	TYLER	But a good strange.
L212540	u5262	m348	JACK	Strange.
L212539	u5269	m348	TYLER	How do you feel?
L212538	u5269	m348	TYLER	Like hell.  That counted.
L212537	u5262	m348	JACK	Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
L212536	u5269	m348	TYLER	Surprise me.
L212535	u5262	m348	JACK	Where do you want it?  In the face?
L212534	u5269	m348	TYLER	Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
L212533	u5262	m348	JACK	This is crazy.
L212532	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
L212531	u5262	m348	JACK	Me?
L212530	u5269	m348	TYLER	I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
L212529	u5262	m348	JACK	No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
L212528	u5269	m348	TYLER	I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
L212527	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't know about this.
L212526	u5262	m348	JACK	You get the idea.
L212525	u5269	m348	TYLER	Go ahead.  Say it.
L212524	u5262	m348	JACK	He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
L212523	u5269	m348	TYLER	... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L212522	u5269	m348	TYLER	Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
L212521	u5262	m348	JACK	He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
L212519	u5262	m348	JACK	Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
L212518	u5269	m348	TYLER	A nice, big cock.
L212517	u5262	m348	JACK	No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
L212516	u5269	m348	TYLER	One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
L212515	u5262	m348	JACK	In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
L212514	u5269	m348	TYLER	-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
L212513	u5262	m348	JACK	It affords him other interesting opportunities.
L212512	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why would anyone want this shitty job?
L212511	u5262	m348	JACK	"It's called a ""changeover.""  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea."
L212510	u5269	m348	TYLER	"They're called ""cigarette burns."""
L212507	u5269	m348	TYLER	I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
L212506	u5262	m348	JACK	What?
L212505	u5269	m348	TYLER	I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
L212504	u5262	m348	JACK	What's that?
L212503	u5269	m348	TYLER	You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
L212502	u5262	m348	JACK	Thank you.
L212501	u5269	m348	TYLER	Yes, you can.
L212500	u5262	m348	JACK	Can I stay at your place?
L212499	u5269	m348	TYLER	Is it a problem for you to ask?
L212498	u5262	m348	JACK	Would that be a problem?
L212497	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
L212496	u5262	m348	JACK	No, I...
L212495	u5269	m348	TYLER	You called me so you could have a place to stay.
L212494	u5262	m348	JACK	Huh?
L212493	u5269	m348	TYLER	We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
L212492	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't follow...
L212491	u5269	m348	TYLER	So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
L212490	u5262	m348	JACK	Yeah.
L212489	u5269	m348	TYLER	A hotel?
L212488	u5262	m348	JACK	God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
L212487	u5269	m348	TYLER	Do what you like.
L212486	u5262	m348	JACK	Don't I?
L212485	u5269	m348	TYLER	The things you own, they end up owning you.
L212484	u5262	m348	JACK	Well, I have to file a claim...
L212483	u5269	m348	TYLER	This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
L212482	u5262	m348	JACK	I don't... think so.
L212481	u5269	m348	TYLER	"The ""now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again"" list.  That list."
L212480	u5262	m348	JACK	What list?
L212479	u5269	m348	TYLER	Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
L212478	u5262	m348	JACK	Insurance'll cover it.
L212477	u5269	m348	TYLER	"Delivered from bullshit colors like ""Cobalt,"" ""Ebony,"" and ""Fuchsia."""
L212476	u5262	m348	JACK	Delivered from Martha Stewart.
L212475	u5269	m348	TYLER	Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
L212474	u5262	m348	JACK	Delivered from Swedish furniture.
L212473	u5269	m348	TYLER	But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
L212472	u5269	m348	TYLER	I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
L212471	u5262	m348	JACK	...no ...no ...
L212470	u5269	m348	TYLER	I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
L212469	u5262	m348	JACK	There's always that.
L212468	u5269	m348	TYLER	Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
L212467	u5262	m348	JACK	All gone.
L212466	u5269	m348	TYLER	And, now it's gone.
L212465	u5262	m348	JACK	I guess so.
L212464	u5269	m348	TYLER	This is how we fill up our lives.
L212463	u5262	m348	JACK	You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
L212428	u5269	m348	TYLER	Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
L212427	u5262	m348	JACK	Well, uh... great.
L212426	u5269	m348	TYLER	Being clever.
L212425	u5262	m348	JACK	What?
L212424	u5269	m348	TYLER	How's that working out for you?
L212423	u5262	m348	JACK	Thank you.
L212422	u5269	m348	TYLER	The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
L212421	u5262	m348	JACK	You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
L212414	u5269	m348	TYLER	"Why?  So you can say, ""Oh, that's what you do."" -- And be a smug little shit about it?"
L212413	u5262	m348	JACK	I mean -- for a living.
L212412	u5269	m348	TYLER	What do you want me to do?
L212411	u5262	m348	JACK	What do you do, Tyler?
L212408	u5269	m348	TYLER	Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
L212407	u5262	m348	JACK	No, supply oxygen?
L212406	u5269	m348	TYLER	You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
L212405	u5269	m348	TYLER	Tyler Durden.
L212404	u5262	m348	JACK	This is how I met --
L212403	u5262	m348	JACK	Pardon me?
L212402	u5269	m348	TYLER	Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
L212221	u5262	m348	JACK	Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
L212220	u5269	m348	TYLER	Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
L212219	u5262	m348	JACK	We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
L212218	u5262	m348	JACK	That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
L212217	u5269	m348	TYLER	It's getting exciting now.
L212213	u5262	m348	JACK	... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
L212212	u5269	m348	TYLER	One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
L213312	u5271	m348	VOICE	Well, sir, you said you might.
L213311	u5262	m348	JACK	Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
L213310	u5271	m348	VOICE	You told me you'd say that, too.
L213309	u5262	m348	JACK	Abort the plan.
L213308	u5271	m348	VOICE	You told me you'd say that.
L213307	u5262	m348	JACK	Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
L213306	u5271	m348	VOICE	Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
L213305	u5262	m348	JACK	Excuse me?
L213304	u5271	m348	VOICE	Very good, Sir.
L213303	u5262	m348	JACK	Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
L213302	u5271	m348	VOICE	Maintenance.
L213301	u5262	m348	JACK	Who is this?
L213177	u5262	m348	JACK	No!
L213176	u5267	m348	RICKY	His name is Robert Paulson!
L213171	u5262	m348	JACK	Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
L213170	u5267	m348	RICKY	Robert Paulson?
L213169	u5262	m348	JACK	No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
L213168	u5267	m348	RICKY	But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
L213167	u5262	m348	JACK	No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
L213166	u5267	m348	RICKY	But, this is Project Mayhem.
L213165	u5262	m348	JACK	What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
L213164	u5267	m348	RICKY	It's what he would have wanted, sir.
L212937	u5264	m348	LOU	Let go of me!!
L212936	u5269	m348	TYLER	Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
L212935	u5264	m348	LOU	Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
L212934	u5269	m348	TYLER	We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
L212933	u5264	m348	LOU	Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
L212932	u5269	m348	TYLER	Pleeeeeease!
L212931	u5264	m348	LOU	What are you doing?!
L212923	u5269	m348	TYLER	You and your friend.
L212922	u5264	m348	LOU	Did you hear what I just said?!
L212921	u5269	m348	TYLER	You're welcome to join our club.
L212920	u5264	m348	LOU	Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
L212919	u5269	m348	TYLER	Yes, it is.
L212918	u5264	m348	LOU	Ain't that something?
L212917	u5269	m348	TYLER	It's free to all.
L212916	u5264	m348	LOU	Really?
L212915	u5269	m348	TYLER	There is no money.
L212914	u5264	m348	LOU	He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
L212913	u5264	m348	LOU	Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
L212912	u5269	m348	TYLER	We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
L212911	u5264	m348	LOU	Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
L212986	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	No, please, no, God, no!
L212985	u5269	m348	TYLER	Would you rather be dead?
L212984	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	Too much school.
L212983	u5269	m348	TYLER	Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
L212982	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
L212981	u5269	m348	TYLER	Animals.
L212977	u5269	m348	TYLER	What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
L212976	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	I... I don't know...
L212975	u5269	m348	TYLER	Why?
L212974	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	Biology, mostly.
L212971	u5269	m348	TYLER	Stuff.  Were the mid-terms hard?
L212970	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	S-S-Stuff.
L212967	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	Please, God, no...
L212966	u5269	m348	TYLER	Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
L212965	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	Yesssss...
L212964	u5269	m348	TYLER	Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
L212963	u5269	m348	TYLER	They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.
L212962	u5266	m348	RAYMOND	How'd you know?
L212961	u5269	m348	TYLER	Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
L219646	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Comanche Indian.
L219645	u5339	m355	BOYD	By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
L219644	u5345	m355	FLETCH	God I admire you.
L219643	u5339	m355	BOYD	Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
L219642	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
L219641	u5339	m355	BOYD	Unbelievable.
L219640	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
L219639	u5339	m355	BOYD	Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
L219638	u5345	m355	FLETCH	First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
L219949	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Oh, thanks.
L219948	u5340	m355	CLERK	Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
L219947	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What?
L219946	u5340	m355	CLERK	You mean her.
L219945	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
L219943	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
L219942	u5340	m355	CLERK	We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
L219941	u5345	m355	FLETCH	So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
L219940	u5340	m355	CLERK	Would you like me to change anything?
L219939	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You're kidding.
L219938	u5340	m355	CLERK	Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
L219675	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Not luck. They don't want me.
L219674	u5341	m355	CREASY	You're lucky.
L219673	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
L219672	u5341	m355	CREASY	What? What are you talking about?
L219671	u5345	m355	FLETCH	They didn't do anything.
L219670	u5341	m355	CREASY	Hey you're really nuts.
L219668	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What goddamn right do you have to take him?
L219667	u5341	m355	CREASY	Fletch!
L219664	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You don't have to run with me, Crease.
L219663	u5341	m355	CREASY	Fletch, this is dumb.
L219662	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hey, what are you doing?
L219321	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You're not taking real good care of yourself.
L219320	u5341	m355	CREASY	Nineteen.
L219319	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Creasy, how old are you?
L219318	u5341	m355	CREASY	I ought to get some sleep.
L219317	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
L219316	u5341	m355	CREASY	He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
L219315	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I wasn't asking.
L219314	u5341	m355	CREASY	I have no idea.
L219313	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Wonder who his supplier is.
L219312	u5341	m355	CREASY	Sonofabitch.
L219311	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
L219310	u5341	m355	CREASY	He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
L219309	u5345	m355	FLETCH	That's what he said.
L219308	u5341	m355	CREASY	Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
L219307	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Maybe tonight?
L220192	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Go ahead. Make my evening.
L220191	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	This one's going to be even more fun.
L220177	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Thank God, the police.
L220176	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Greetings, everyone.
L219772	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
L219771	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Thanks for coming down to see us.
L219770	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	That a boy.
L219769	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Not a prayer.
L219768	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
L219767	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
L219766	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
L219765	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	What'll it be Fletch?
L219764	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
L219763	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Can I ask anybody now?
L219762	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Ask anybody.
L219761	u5345	m355	FLETCH	My God, you're serious.
L219760	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
L219759	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
L219758	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
L219757	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You can't keep me here.
L219755	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
L219754	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
L219752	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
L219751	u5345	m355	FLETCH	'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
L219750	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
L219749	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
L219748	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
L219747	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It was planted on me, sir.
L219746	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
L219745	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
L219744	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
L219743	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
L219742	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
L219741	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Fletch F. Fletch
L219740	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Full name.
L219739	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Fletch.
L219738	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
L219737	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
L220189	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
L220188	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
L220186	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
L220185	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
L220184	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
L220183	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
L220182	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
L220179	u5342	m355	CUMMINGS	Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
L220178	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	What the hell are you doing here?
L219514	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
L219513	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
L219512	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
L219511	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
L219510	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
L219509	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
L219508	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
L219507	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Just relax.
L219506	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
L219505	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	There is?
L219504	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
L219503	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Breathe easy...
L219502	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
L219501	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
L219500	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Just relax....
L219499	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
L219498	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
L219497	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
L219496	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
L219495	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Sure, but the end was so sudden.
L219494	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Oh, he was dying for years.
L219493	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
L219492	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
L219491	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Is she ever. I've got some stories....
L219490	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Funny old bird.
L219489	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Margaret.
L219488	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Well, which one?
L219487	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Right.
L219486	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Joan or Margaret Smith.
L219485	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Mrs. Smith.
L219484	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Your aunt?
L219483	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
L219482	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
L219481	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
L219480	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	No children?
L219479	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I don't know. I don't have any.
L219478	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
L219477	u5345	m355	FLETCH	But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
L219476	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	That's two.
L219475	u5345	m355	FLETCH	One. B-a-b-a-r.
L219474	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Two bs?
L219473	u5345	m355	FLETCH	That's Babar.
L219472	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
L219471	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
L219470	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
L219469	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yes.
L219468	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	Really. The California Racquet Club?
L219467	u5345	m355	FLETCH	We play tennis at the club.
L219466	u5343	m355	DR. DOLEN	So where do you know Alan from?
L220118	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
L220117	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Gum thought Brazil.
L220116	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	You find the source?
L220115	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What?
L220114	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
L220113	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
L220112	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
L220111	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You don't have a piece of the action?
L220110	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
L220109	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
L220108	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	You gonna nail the chief?
L220107	u5345	m355	FLETCH	For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
L220106	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Thought so. What for?
L220105	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Affirmative.
L220104	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	The two surfer boys?
L220103	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Affirmative.
L220102	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	What, the heat here?
L220101	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm serious, Sam.
L220100	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	My pleasure.
L220099	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You don't know me.
L220098	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Jesus.
L219298	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don?t you?
L219297	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Fletch...
L219296	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I think I?d rather have drugs.
L219295	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
L219294	u5345	m355	FLETCH	For sure?
L219293	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Like tonight.
L219292	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Like when?
L219291	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	Okay. Some idea.
L219290	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No idea at all?
L219289	u5344	m355	FAT SAM	No idea.
L219288	u5345	m355	FLETCH	So what do you figure?
L219550	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He'll be so relieved.
L219549	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	I guess not.
L219548	u5345	m355	FLETCH	This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
L219547	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	That's it.
L219546	u5345	m355	FLETCH	That's it?
L219545	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
L219544	u5345	m355	FLETCH	My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
L219543	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Is there anything particular you're looking for?
L219542	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Thank you.
L219541	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Here you are, Doctor.
L219540	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Yes, right away.
L219539	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
L219538	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
L219537	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Oh my God!
L219536	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
L219535	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
L219534	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
L219533	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Can I get you something?
L219532	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm fine.
L219531	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	You're in the Records Room.
L219530	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Where am I?
L219529	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Are you all right, Doctor?
L219519	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Right. Fine.
L219518	u5356	m355	RECORDS NURSE	Nothing. They're still there.
L219517	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
L219579	u5347	m355	GILLETT	Till then.
L219578	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
L219577	u5347	m355	GILLETT	Cash. I'm impressed.
L219576	u5347	m355	GILLETT	This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
L219575	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Damn... lost again. Sorry.
L219573	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
L219572	u5347	m355	GILLETT	That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
L219571	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Are you serious?
L219570	u5347	m355	GILLETT	You may be right.
L219569	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
L219568	u5347	m355	GILLETT	I agree.
L219567	u5345	m355	FLETCH	My lawyer was a bum.
L219566	u5347	m355	GILLETT	You should have proved that in a court of law.
L219565	u5345	m355	FLETCH	She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
L219564	u5347	m355	GILLETT	I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
L219563	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
L219562	u5347	m355	GILLETT	Until she remarries, Fletch.
L219561	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
L219560	u5347	m355	GILLETT	I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
L219559	u5345	m355	FLETCH	She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
L219558	u5347	m355	GILLETT	You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
L219555	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
L219554	u5347	m355	GILLETT	I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
L219553	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
L219552	u5347	m355	GILLETT	Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
L220172	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Whoops.
L220171	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
L220166	u5345	m355	FLETCH	How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
L220165	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	And what was that?
L220164	u5345	m355	FLETCH	The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
L220163	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
L220161	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
L220160	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	I'd have been long gone.
L220159	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
L220154	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
L220153	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
L220152	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
L220149	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Cut the crap and read it.
L220148	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	Wait a second --
L220147	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Read this, please.
L220146	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	What?
L220145	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
L220144	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
L220143	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	Of course.
L220142	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
L220141	u5353	m355	MR. STANWYK	Good evening.
L220029	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
L220028	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
L220025	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Of course they are.
L220024	u5345	m355	FLETCH	And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
L220023	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He sighs.
L220018	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Course he has. That's his wife.
L220017	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Then he has.
L220016	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
L220015	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Has he?
L220008	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
L220007	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
L220006	u5352	m355	MARVIN	What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
L220005	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
L220004	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Since he moved to L.A.
L220003	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Isn't that nice. Since when?
L220002	u5352	m355	MARVIN	That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
L220001	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Ten days ago?
L220000	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Oh, about ten days ago.
L219999	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
L219998	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Check.
L219997	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
L219996	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Velma.
L219995	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
L219993	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Come on in.
L219992	u5345	m355	FLETCH	California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
L219991	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Yes. Where you from, Harry?
L219990	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
L219989	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Well, I'm fully covered.
L219988	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Right.
L219987	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
L219986	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
L219985	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
L219984	u5345	m355	FLETCH	My parents were great fans of the former President.
L219983	u5352	m355	MARVIN	Harry S. Truman?
L219982	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
L220208	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No problem.
L220207	u5346	m355	GAIL	I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
L220206	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What are you doing here?
L220205	u5346	m355	GAIL	Not mine, stupid. Yours.
L220204	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
L220203	u5346	m355	GAIL	God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
L220202	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Right.
L220201	u5346	m355	GAIL	John Ultramalensky, right?
L220197	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You sure did.
L220196	u5346	m355	GAIL	I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
L220195	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
L220194	u5346	m355	GAIL	Where are you going?
L220193	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
L220096	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Wait here for me, Gummy.
L220095	u5348	m355	GUMMY	Yeah. Maybe.
L220094	u5345	m355	FLETCH	That's Brazil.
L220093	u5348	m355	GUMMY	Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
L220092	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
L220091	u5348	m355	GUMMY	I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
L220090	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Where does the Chief get the drugs?
L220088	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Twenty years.
L220087	u5348	m355	GUMMY	Fletch, I never sold nothing.
L220086	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Sure you did.
L220085	u5348	m355	GUMMY	I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
L220084	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
L220083	u5348	m355	GUMMY	What's that?
L220082	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
L220080	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
L220079	u5348	m355	GUMMY	Why are they after you?
L220078	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
L220077	u5348	m355	GUMMY	What?
L220076	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
L220075	u5348	m355	GUMMY	Fletch?
L220074	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm the Sufi.
L219305	u5348	m355	GUMMY	I know. I got bad luck or something.
L219304	u5345	m355	FLETCH	They bust you every week.
L219303	u5348	m355	GUMMY	They busted me last week.
L219302	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I know.
L219301	u5348	m355	GUMMY	It?s okay. The cops did it.
L219300	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hi Gummy. How?s the eye?
L219299	u5348	m355	GUMMY	Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
L219401	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Sure.
L219400	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Will you kill me?
L219399	u5357	m355	STANWYK	What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
L219398	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You sure got the hard part.
L219397	u5357	m355	STANWYK	That's right.
L219396	u5345	m355	FLETCH	The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
L219395	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
L219394	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You sure those doors will be open?
L219393	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
L219392	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
L219391	u5357	m355	STANWYK	It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
L219390	u5345	m355	FLETCH	They serve dinner on the flight?
L219389	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
L219388	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Where am I going?
L219387	u5357	m355	STANWYK	LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
L219386	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Take it where?
L219385	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
L219384	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Sure, all drifters do.
L219383	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Do you have a passport?
L219382	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
L219381	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Get me on the first shot, if you can.
L219380	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
L219379	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Precisely. Are you a good shot?
L219378	u5345	m355	FLETCH	So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
L219377	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
L219376	u5345	m355	FLETCH	A .357.
L219375	u5357	m355	STANWYK	In this drawer....
L219374	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
L219373	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
L219372	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I have the same problem with my help.
L219371	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
L219370	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Wouldn't they normally be locked?
L219369	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
L219368	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm still here.
L219366	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
L219365	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
L219364	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
L219363	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Maybe I'm just on vacation.
L219362	u5357	m355	STANWYK	You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
L219361	u5345	m355	FLETCH	So why pick me?
L219360	u5357	m355	STANWYK	My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
L219359	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Why don't you try suicide?
L219358	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
L219357	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
L219353	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I want you to murder me.
L219352	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm all ears.
L219351	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
L219345	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Come inside.
L219344	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
L219342	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
L219341	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Who?
L219340	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
L219335	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Charmed.
L219334	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Alan Stanwyk.
L219333	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Nugent. Ted Nugent.
L219332	u5357	m355	STANWYK	It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
L219331	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
L219330	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
L219329	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
L219328	u5357	m355	STANWYK	I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
L219327	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
L219326	u5357	m355	STANWYK	Because we can't.
L219325	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Why not?
L219324	u5357	m355	STANWYK	We can't talk about it here.
L220037	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
L220036	u5349	m355	LARRY	I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
L220035	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
L220034	u5349	m355	LARRY	I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
L219701	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Nothing to it.
L219700	u5349	m355	LARRY	My hero.
L219690	u5349	m355	LARRY	That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
L219689	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yeah.
L219688	u5349	m355	LARRY	Did you say cops?
L219685	u5345	m355	FLETCH	That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
L219684	u5349	m355	LARRY	Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
L219465	u5349	m355	LARRY	Only one way to find out.
L219464	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I wonder if that's his doctor.
L219463	u5345	m355	FLETCH	'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
L219462	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Maybe.
L219461	u5349	m355	LARRY	You doing a story on this guy?
L219460	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Thanks.
L219459	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Spot right here.
L219458	u5349	m355	LARRY	Not our kind of people, you understand.
L219457	u5345	m355	FLETCH	'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
L219456	u5349	m355	LARRY	Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
L219455	u5345	m355	FLETCH	'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
L219419	u5349	m355	LARRY	No problem, boss.
L219418	u5345	m355	FLETCH	W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
L219416	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
L219415	u5349	m355	LARRY	Not me.
L219414	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Did you hear something?
L219412	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Don't say shoot, okay.
L219411	u5349	m355	LARRY	Shoot.
L219410	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
L219409	u5349	m355	LARRY	'Magic' today, huh?
L219408	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Deal.
L219407	u5349	m355	LARRY	Only if you promise not to return me.
L219406	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Can I steal you for a minute?
L219405	u5349	m355	LARRY	Yo!
L220032	u5358	m355	VELMA	How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
L220031	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No, thank you.
L220030	u5358	m355	VELMA	Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
L220027	u5345	m355	FLETCH	How long have they been married?
L220026	u5358	m355	VELMA	She's cute as a button.
L220022	u5358	m355	VELMA	Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
L220021	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
L220020	u5358	m355	VELMA	Cute thing.
L220019	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
L220012	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You've met her?
L220011	u5358	m355	VELMA	His bride. Cute as a button.
L220010	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm sorry?
L220009	u5358	m355	VELMA	Cute young thing, too.
L220181	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
L220180	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
L220158	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I want to hear this.
L220157	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You shouldn't be here.
L220156	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Don't worry, I can take it.
L220071	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Come here.
L220070	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I'm terrified.
L220067	u5345	m355	FLETCH	They're trying to kill me!
L220066	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Don't tell me I can't --
L220065	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You can't do that.
L220064	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I'm calling the police. Right now.
L220063	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
L220062	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Bastard.
L220061	u5345	m355	FLETCH	And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
L220060	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
L220059	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
L220058	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I checked. There was no divorce.
L220057	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	What is this....
L220055	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Gail, please.
L220054	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
L220053	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I think you better sit down.
L220052	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
L220050	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
L220049	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No.
L220048	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
L220047	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What's wrong, Gail?
L219914	u5345	m355	FLETCH	If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
L219913	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I was afraid you'd say that.
L219912	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Act natural.
L219911	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
L219910	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
L219909	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	What are you talking about?
L219908	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'll take you to a game.
L219907	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
L219906	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
L219905	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
L219904	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
L219900	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
L219899	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
L219898	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
L219895	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You saw a forgery.
L219894	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	But I've seen the deed.
L219893	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
L219892	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
L219891	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
L219890	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	What does all this mean?
L219889	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
L219888	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	How do you know about that?
L219887	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
L219884	u5345	m355	FLETCH	That's what I want to know.
L219883	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	What are you talking about?
L219882	u5345	m355	FLETCH	So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
L219881	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	So?
L219880	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
L219879	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Who.
L219878	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
L219877	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
L219876	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yeah.
L219875	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
L219874	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Why did you do it?
L219873	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
L219872	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I think you should call me Gail, now.
L219871	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
L219863	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Long story.
L219862	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	What is this?
L219861	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Thanks for the great time.
L219858	u5345	m355	FLETCH	How come?
L219857	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	He never sees them and I never met them.
L219856	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What about his parents?
L219855	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
L219854	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Good point.
L219853	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
L219852	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
L219851	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
L219850	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Why'd you let me in?
L219849	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
L219848	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Are you still in love with Alan?
L219847	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Depends on the question.
L219846	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Can I ask you a question?
L219845	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Just like Alan. It's freaky.
L219844	u5345	m355	FLETCH	'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
L219843	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
L219842	u5345	m355	FLETCH	'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
L219841	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	It's amazing.
L219840	u5345	m355	FLETCH	'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
L219829	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No. He was. I got him out.
L219828	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	You were in the war?
L219827	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I saved his life during the war.
L219826	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	All this goes on Underhill's bill?
L219820	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	God...
L219819	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Lunch...
L219818	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yes.
L219817	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
L219815	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Here, take mine.
L219814	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I mean put clothes on.
L219813	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
L219812	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I really should change.
L219811	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Down boy.
L219810	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
L219809	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	You ordered it here?
L219808	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I ordered lunch.
L219807	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
L219806	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
L219805	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
L219804	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I was hoping you'd say that.
L219803	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Hi.
L219802	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hi.
L219801	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	John Ultramalensky?
L219800	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
L219799	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Who is it?
L219631	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
L219630	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What's he doing in Utah?
L219629	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	See what I mean?
L219628	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You are a rich woman.
L219627	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
L219626	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
L219625	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
L219624	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
L219623	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Alan's in Utah.
L219622	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
L219621	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I bet you do.
L219620	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I have this effect on lots of women.
L219619	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
L219616	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I love the outfits.
L219615	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Why do you keep doing this?
L219613	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
L219612	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Preoccupied with what?
L219611	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
L219610	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
L219609	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Damn, I thought I had that one.
L219601	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Please.
L219600	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
L219599	u5345	m355	FLETCH	So were my parents.
L219598	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	That's a strange combination.
L219597	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It's Scotch-Rumanian.
L219596	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
L219595	u5345	m355	FLETCH	John Ultrarelamensky.
L219594	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	John who?
L219593	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	John! You used to fly together!
L219592	u5345	m355	FLETCH	We used to fly together. I'm... John.
L219591	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
L219590	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
L219589	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
L219588	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
L220199	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
L220198	u5359	m355	WAITER	Your call is come through.
L219825	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Sierra del fuego.
L219824	u5359	m355	WAITER	Muchas gracias.
L219823	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
L219822	u5359	m355	WAITER	You want I set up?
L219797	u5359	m355	WAITER	Very good, sir.
L219796	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
L219795	u5359	m355	WAITER	I recommend it.
L219794	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
L219793	u5359	m355	WAITER	Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
L219792	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
L219791	u5359	m355	WAITER	Charged to the Underhills, sir?
L219790	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I would, actually.
L219789	u5359	m355	WAITER	Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
L219788	u5345	m355	FLETCH	One.
L219787	u5359	m355	WAITER	Cabana one.
L219786	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
L219785	u5359	m355	WAITER	In her cabana, sir.
L219784	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
L219608	u5359	m355	WAITER	Very good sir.
L219607	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
L219606	u5359	m355	WAITER	Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
L219605	u5345	m355	FLETCH	They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
L219604	u5359	m355	WAITER	They just left, sir.
L219603	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
L219602	u5359	m355	WAITER	Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
L219977	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
L219976	u5350	m355	MAN	Tell the cops.
L219975	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm her cousin.
L219974	u5350	m355	MAN	I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
L219973	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
L219972	u5350	m355	MAN	What did you want under the bed?
L219971	u5345	m355	FLETCH	This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
L219970	u5350	m355	MAN	This morning.
L219969	u5345	m355	FLETCH	So you're saying she moved out.
L219968	u5350	m355	MAN	She moved out.
L219967	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
L219966	u5345	m355	FLETCH	She moved out?
L219965	u5350	m355	MAN	Moved out.
L219964	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Where is she?
L219963	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
L219962	u5350	m355	MAN	Who are you?
L219961	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
L219960	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I commend him on his choice
L219959	u5350	m355	MAN	What?
L219958	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I commend him on his choice.
L219957	u5350	m355	MAN	I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
L219956	u5345	m355	FLETCH	No wonder.
L219955	u5350	m355	MAN	Lock's busted.
L219954	u5345	m355	FLETCH	The door was unlocked.
L219323	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What?
L219322	u5350	m355	MAN	Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
L220139	u5360	m355	WALKER	Fletch.
L220138	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
L220137	u5360	m355	WALKER	I was upset.
L220136	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Not really?
L220135	u5360	m355	WALKER	Not really.
L220134	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You were going to can me, right?
L220133	u5360	m355	WALKER	Fletch, you want an apology?
L220129	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Forget it.
L220128	u5360	m355	WALKER	Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
L220127	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
L220124	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
L220123	u5360	m355	WALKER	What...
L220122	u5345	m355	FLETCH	This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
L220121	u5360	m355	WALKER	What?  Who the hell are they?
L220120	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
L219783	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Print this Frank.
L219782	u5360	m355	WALKER	I want something I can print!
L219781	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
L219780	u5360	m355	WALKER	But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
L219779	u5345	m355	FLETCH	You'll have it.
L219778	u5360	m355	WALKER	You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
L219777	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
L219776	u5360	m355	WALKER	Get out of here.
L219775	u5345	m355	FLETCH	It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
L219774	u5360	m355	WALKER	It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
L219773	u5345	m355	FLETCH	How could you call him?
L219699	u5360	m355	WALKER	Go to transportation, get a ticket.
L219698	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
L219697	u5360	m355	WALKER	Who? Donnie and Marie?
L219696	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I have some ideas.
L219695	u5360	m355	WALKER	What about finding the source?
L219694	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
L219693	u5360	m355	WALKER	Utah?
L219692	u5345	m355	FLETCH	More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
L219687	u5345	m355	FLETCH	All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
L219686	u5360	m355	WALKER	Just give me a hint, all right?
L219679	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
L219678	u5360	m355	WALKER	You're onto something. That's good. What?
L219677	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
L219676	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Gummy and two cops...
L219453	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
L219452	u5360	m355	WALKER	I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
L219451	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I'd say charcoal.
L219450	u5360	m355	WALKER	How gray?
L219449	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Well, there we're in a gray area.
L219448	u5360	m355	WALKER	Who?
L219447	u5345	m355	FLETCH	He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
L219446	u5360	m355	WALKER	So let's go! We run the pictures.
L219445	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I have pictures of him. Dealing...
L219444	u5360	m355	WALKER	What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
L219443	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Practically.
L219442	u5360	m355	WALKER	You broke it? You know the source?
L219441	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
L219440	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Why not? Oh shit... really?
L219439	u5360	m355	WALKER	Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
L219436	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Looks great.
L219435	u5360	m355	WALKER	I don't know.  Look!
L219434	u5345	m355	FLETCH	What's the spread on the game tonight?
L219433	u5360	m355	WALKER	...never reads the paper...
L219432	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I never read the paper.
L219431	u5360	m355	WALKER	No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
L219430	u5345	m355	FLETCH	I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
L219429	u5360	m355	WALKER	Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
L219428	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
L219427	u5360	m355	WALKER	Irwin...
L219426	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Two...
L219425	u5345	m355	FLETCH	And a damn fine one, I might add.
L219424	u5360	m355	WALKER	'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
L219423	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Uh, almost.
L219422	u5360	m355	WALKER	No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
L219421	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
L219420	u5360	m355	WALKER	Fletch.
L219653	u5345	m355	FLETCH	My secretary.
L219652	u5351	m355	MARGIE	Who's Frieda?
L219651	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Frieda's boss.
L219650	u5351	m355	MARGIE	And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
L219649	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Yeah.
L219648	u5351	m355	MARGIE	Jim Swarthout?
L219647	u5345	m355	FLETCH	Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
L219886	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	In a minute!
L219885	u5354	m355	MR. UNDERHILL	Mrs. Stanwyk!
L219869	u5354	m355	MR. UNDERHILL	Of course.
L219868	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
L219867	u5354	m355	MR. UNDERHILL	I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
L219866	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	You don't know the Underhills?
L219865	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	John!
L219864	u5354	m355	MR. UNDERHILL	Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
L219860	u5354	m355	MR. UNDERHILL	Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
L219859	u5355	m355	MRS. STANWYK	Yes?
L276401	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
L276400	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
L276399	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
L276301	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Just get better okay?
L276300	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
L276299	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
L276298	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I understand... I won't-
L276297	u5806	m385	ALLISON	If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
L276296	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Sorry.
L276293	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What was it?
L276292	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
L276291	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
L276290	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No.
L276289	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Did I ever talk about the accident?
L276288	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
L276287	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Well?
L276286	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Sure plenty of times.
L276284	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
L276283	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
L276282	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
L276281	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
L276280	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I did more then that.
L276279	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
L276278	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
L276277	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I understand, I think. Other women?
L276276	u5820	m385	TREVOR	We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
L276274	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You just made that up.
L276273	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Pitbull attacks.
L276272	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Eighty third most common.
L276271	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Skin cancer.
L276270	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Second most common?
L276269	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
L276268	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
L276267	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
L276266	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Okay so... what's the safest place?
L276265	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
L276264	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Bull...
L276263	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It's inside a moving car.
L276262	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I'm stumped.
L276261	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hint. It's not a geographical location.
L276259	u5806	m385	ALLISON	All finished.
L276258	u5820	m385	TREVOR	So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
L276257	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
L276256	u5820	m385	TREVOR	The way you just looked at me...
L276255	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Of course, yes.
L276253	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
L276252	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
L276249	u5806	m385	ALLISON	I'm all over it.
L276248	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
L276247	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
L276202	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I miss her. I miss my wife.
L276201	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
L276200	u5820	m385	TREVOR	If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
L276199	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
L276198	u5820	m385	TREVOR	These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
L276105	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
L276104	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
L276103	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
L276102	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
L276098	u5806	m385	ALLISON	No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
L276097	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Your insight is enlightening.
L276096	u5806	m385	ALLISON	That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
L276095	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
L276094	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
L276092	u5806	m385	ALLISON	You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
L276091	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's happening to me? What are you doing?
L275995	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Your wife...?
L275994	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
L275993	u5806	m385	ALLISON	It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
L275992	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
L275991	u5806	m385	ALLISON	Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
L275990	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Are you a dream too?
L276430	u5807	m385	BRET	I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
L276429	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
L276428	u5807	m385	BRET	We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
L276427	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Bret. What the hell is going on?
L276426	u5807	m385	BRET	Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
L276425	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Bret... what the fuck...?
L276332	u5807	m385	BRET	Someone special.
L276331	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Yeah? You and who else?
L276330	u5807	m385	BRET	Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
L276329	u5820	m385	TREVOR	So you're just packing it up just like that?
L276327	u5807	m385	BRET	As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
L276326	u5820	m385	TREVOR	How much time off?
L276325	u5807	m385	BRET	I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
L276324	u5807	m385	BRET	I quit. Today's my last day.
L276323	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's the occasion?
L276322	u5807	m385	BRET	Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
L276124	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
L276123	u5807	m385	BRET	You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
L276122	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
L276121	u5807	m385	BRET	GWEN?
L276120	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Gwen.
L276119	u5807	m385	BRET	Really? Do tell.
L276118	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I have my connections
L276117	u5807	m385	BRET	Yeah, how's that?
L276116	u5820	m385	TREVOR	The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
L276112	u5807	m385	BRET	Getting paid for doing shit.
L276111	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276110	u5807	m385	BRET	Must be nice.
L276007	u5807	m385	BRET	Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
L276006	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Since what?
L276005	u5807	m385	BRET	Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
L276004	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
L276003	u5807	m385	BRET	Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
L276002	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
L276001	u5807	m385	BRET	Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
L276386	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Allison Dormere. Your intern.
L276385	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Who's Allison?
L276384	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where's Allison?
L276383	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
L276381	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
L276380	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I've been in here before.
L276379	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Have we met?
L276378	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Ambrose. I know.
L276377	u5808	m385	DR. AMBROSE	Hello I'm Dr...
L276451	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's that?
L276450	u5809	m385	GIVENS	Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
L276162	u5809	m385	GIVENS	How many zeros was your wife worth?
L276161	u5820	m385	TREVOR	As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
L276160	u5809	m385	GIVENS	Zero's a number right?
L276159	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You could say that.
L276158	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
L276157	u5809	m385	GIVENS	Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
L276156	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's the difference?
L276155	u5809	m385	GIVENS	No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
L276154	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I said she's been missing for-
L276153	u5809	m385	GIVENS	What did you just say?
L276082	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
L276081	u5810	m385	GWEN	Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
L276080	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276079	u5810	m385	GWEN	Good boy.  Where's is it?
L276025	u5810	m385	GWEN	No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
L276024	u5820	m385	TREVOR	That was cold...
L276023	u5810	m385	GWEN	Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
L276022	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Gwen, my wife's dead.
L276021	u5810	m385	GWEN	YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
L276020	u5810	m385	GWEN	And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
L276019	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
L276018	u5810	m385	GWEN	What's wrong, Trev?
L276017	u5810	m385	GWEN	How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
L276016	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
L276015	u5810	m385	GWEN	Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
L276013	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
L276012	u5810	m385	GWEN	Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
L276361	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It's perfect.
L276360	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
L276359	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
L276358	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You're alive...
L276357	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
L276356	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Kirsty... Kirsty?
L276073	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
L276072	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
L276070	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	I only married you for your body.
L276069	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Really, why's that?
L276068	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
L276067	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
L276066	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
L276065	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Really? Why?
L276064	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Never to put you in my will.
L276063	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276062	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
L276061	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
L276060	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
L276059	u5820	m385	TREVOR	In a word? Lucrative.
L276058	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
L275979	u5820	m385	TREVOR	This isn't happening.
L275978	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
L275976	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
L275975	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L275974	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Oh my God. It's coming out.
L275970	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
L275969	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
L275968	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	You've been cheating on me haven't you?
L275967	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
L275965	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
L275964	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
L275961	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
L275960	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But... I thought...
L275959	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	You win! Okay pull over.
L275958	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Eighty four.
L275957	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Uh... eighty two?
L275956	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
L275955	u5811	m385	KIRSTY	Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
L275954	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
L276456	u5812	m385	LANGE	That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
L276455	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Morgue...?
L276319	u5812	m385	LANGE	We're all here for you Trevor.
L276318	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Thanks.
L276317	u5812	m385	LANGE	The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
L276316	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What?
L276315	u5812	m385	LANGE	Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
L276312	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where is she? Where is my wife?
L276311	u5812	m385	LANGE	You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
L276310	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
L276309	u5812	m385	LANGE	I thought you loved games.
L276307	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No please make yourself at home.
L276306	u5812	m385	LANGE	Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
L276037	u5812	m385	LANGE	I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
L276036	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
L276035	u5812	m385	LANGE	For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
L276034	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What evidence?
L276033	u5812	m385	LANGE	Okay then. Here's the scoop.
L276032	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Where's my wife?
L276031	u5812	m385	LANGE	Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
L276243	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
L276242	u5813	m385	LARRY	Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
L276241	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
L276240	u5813	m385	LARRY	Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
L276239	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
L276238	u5813	m385	LARRY	Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
L276237	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
L276233	u5820	m385	TREVOR	How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
L276232	u5813	m385	LARRY	And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
L276231	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
L276230	u5813	m385	LARRY	Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
L276229	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
L276228	u5813	m385	LARRY	A little? Try unbelievably.
L276227	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
L276406	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Who the hell are you talking to?
L276405	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What do you want?!
L276404	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Hey buddy!
L276403	u5820	m385	TREVOR	... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
L276402	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Hey buddy!
L276396	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Music to my ears.
L276395	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't work here.
L276394	u5814	m385	OLD MAN	Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
L276373	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Wow you are out of it.  
L276372	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
L276371	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Can you follow them?
L276370	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Two.
L276369	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
L276367	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	We're just gonna take some blood here.
L276366	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Ambulance.
L276365	u5815	m385	PARAMEDIC	Do you know where you are?
L276466	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
L276465	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What's under that sheet...?
L276461	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
L276460	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
L276459	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
L276423	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
L276422	u5820	m385	TREVOR	This game is over do you hear me?
L276421	u5816	m385	PINHEAD	Poor Trevor.
L276418	u5817	m385	PRIEST	Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
L276417	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
L276416	u5817	m385	PRIEST	All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
L276415	u5820	m385	TREVOR	But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
L276411	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
L276410	u5817	m385	PRIEST	What things do you think you've done?
L276409	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
L276355	u5818	m385	SAGE	Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
L276354	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Wait... what the hell is this...
L276353	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I surrender...
L276352	u5818	m385	SAGE	Are you ready?
L276351	u5818	m385	SAGE	You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
L276350	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
L276349	u5818	m385	SAGE	It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
L276348	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
L276347	u5818	m385	SAGE	My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
L276346	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
L276345	u5818	m385	SAGE	Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
L276139	u5818	m385	SAGE	You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
L276138	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
L276137	u5818	m385	SAGE	Dreams?
L276210	u5819	m385	TAWNY	WHAT?!
L276209	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
L276208	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
L276207	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
L276206	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
L276194	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Well now there's a compliment.
L276193	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
L276189	u5819	m385	TAWNY	It's getting hot in here.
L276188	u5820	m385	TREVOR	You must have been very proud of yourselves...
L276187	u5819	m385	TAWNY	If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
L276185	u5819	m385	TAWNY	For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
L276184	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
L276182	u5819	m385	TAWNY	God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
L276181	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
L276180	u5819	m385	TAWNY	I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
L276179	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Really?
L276178	u5820	m385	TREVOR	I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
L276177	u5819	m385	TAWNY	You okay?
L276176	u5819	m385	TAWNY	YOU!
L276175	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
L276174	u5819	m385	TAWNY	You.
L276173	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
L276172	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Hey. Can I borrow something?
L276056	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
L276055	u5820	m385	TREVOR	It's not that kind of date.
L276054	u5819	m385	TAWNY	The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
L276053	u5820	m385	TREVOR	Last week...
L276052	u5820	m385	TREVOR	What do you mean?
L276051	u5819	m385	TAWNY	Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
L276050	u5820	m385	TREVOR	-Tawny.
L276049	u5820	m385	TREVOR	No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
L276048	u5819	m385	TAWNY	... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
L291527	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
L291526	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	And how the hell are we going to do that?
L291525	u5919	m391	EVELYN	But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
L291524	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
L291523	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
L291522	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
L291521	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- the whole thing is falling apart!
L291520	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	-- bullshit --
L291519	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
L291518	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
L291517	u5919	m391	EVELYN	So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
L291516	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Not yet.
L291515	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
L291514	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	It's complicated. But don't worry --
L291513	u5919	m391	EVELYN	So what stopped her?
L291512	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	"-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your ""demise."""
L291511	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
L291510	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw... well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
L291509	u5919	m391	EVELYN	"-- ""oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"""
L291508	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
L291507	u5919	m391	EVELYN	And what's Steven's status?
L291506	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
L291505	u5919	m391	EVELYN	You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
L291504	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
L291203	u5919	m391	EVELYN	No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
L291202	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'm confused.
L291201	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
L291200	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
L291199	u5919	m391	EVELYN	"We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't ""believe"" in divorce."
L291145	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
L291144	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
L291316	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
L291315	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Oh dear.
L291314	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Jesus H. Christ!
L291123	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	"It was on my Dad's list of ""things to do."" But the House did him first."
L291122	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
L291012	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
L291011	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
L291010	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
L291008	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'm moved beyond words.
L291007	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	"Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it ""inspirational."" From some German cathedral a million years ago: ""Driving the Demons From the Mind."""
L291006	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Not at all!
L291005	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
L290979	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
L290978	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
L291464	u5925	m391	SARA	C'mon.
L291463	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Don't think it'll be a problem.
L291460	u5925	m391	SARA	"-- the ""Saturation Chamber."" Where he wanted to put me."
L291459	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
L291353	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
L291352	u5925	m391	SARA	More the merrier.
L291302	u5925	m391	SARA	Yeah...something.
L291301	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
L291127	u5925	m391	SARA	-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
L291126	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Oh, for chrissake --
L291003	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	More to the point. Where's our host?
L291002	u5925	m391	SARA	Looks like we're it.
L291446	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
L291445	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
L291438	u5923	m391	PRICE	Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
L291437	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Oh, really: who?
L291418	u5923	m391	PRICE	Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
L291417	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	-- what was he doing here?
L291416	u5923	m391	PRICE	Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
L291396	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
L291395	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'm sorry --
L291380	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I don't know!!
L291379	u5923	m391	PRICE	Where is it??
L291344	u5923	m391	PRICE	Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
L291343	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
L291342	u5923	m391	PRICE	Excuse me?
L291341	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Three times, to be exact.
L291340	u5923	m391	PRICE	Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
L291299	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Is she alright?
L291298	u5923	m391	PRICE	What?
L291296	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Ms. Marr!
L291295	u5923	m391	PRICE	Melissa!
L291286	u5923	m391	PRICE	Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
L291285	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	There must be some other way out.

L291082	u5923	m391	PRICE	Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
L291076	u5923	m391	PRICE	A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
L291075	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	What are you playing here, Price?
L291467	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
L291466	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
L291465	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
L291427	u5918	m391	EDDIE	And I think that's case --

L291323	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- fuck you!
L291322	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
L291110	u5917	m391	BLACKBURN	If this is someone's idea of a joke --
L291109	u5918	m391	EDDIE	This thing's going nowhere.

L291609	u5918	m391	EDDIE	It's not going to let us out!
L291608	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
L291574	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
L291573	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What?
L291572	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Uhhhh...

L291491	u5918	m391	EDDIE	How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
L291490	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
L291489	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Shit, Pritchett!!!
L291385	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	The...Fourth of July.

L291228	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Did it work?
L291227	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	"New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to ""normalcy."""
L291222	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
L291221	u5918	m391	EDDIE	So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
L291216	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
L291215	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What is it? What's in there?
L291213	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Nothing.
L291212	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What's in there?
L291140	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
L291139	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
L291138	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
L291137	u5918	m391	EDDIE	So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
L291125	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
L291124	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You said that was an accident.
L290997	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
L290996	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
L290994	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
L290993	u5918	m391	EDDIE	'Less the place really is haunted.
L290983	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
L290982	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
L291429	u5923	m391	PRICE	Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
L291428	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- closed.

L291346	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Prove it.
L291345	u5923	m391	PRICE	Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
L291280	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Best of a nightmare.
L291279	u5923	m391	PRICE	Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.

L291174	u5923	m391	PRICE	I'll meet you down there.
L291078	u5923	m391	PRICE	"Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not ""comfortable"" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying."
L291077	u5918	m391	EDDIE	This is nuts.
L291070	u5923	m391	PRICE	The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
L291069	u5918	m391	EDDIE	And we get this money when?
L291068	u5923	m391	PRICE	Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
L291636	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Jesus!
L291635	u5925	m391	SARA	What?
L291634	u5925	m391	SARA	I don't do groups.
L291633	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
L291632	u5925	m391	SARA	Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
L291631	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You okay?
L291619	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What --
L291618	u5925	m391	SARA	Run.
L291617	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Where did it go?
L291612	u5925	m391	SARA	All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
L291611	u5918	m391	EDDIE	It's succeeding!
L291610	u5925	m391	SARA	No. It's just trying to frighten us.
L291603	u5918	m391	EDDIE	For chrissake give me a hand!
L291602	u5925	m391	SARA	The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
L291600	u5925	m391	SARA	-- was that??
L291599	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What --
L291571	u5925	m391	SARA	We're safe?
L291570	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Don't think it's even an issue.
L291569	u5925	m391	SARA	He's dead...?
L291568	u5918	m391	EDDIE	It's okay, everything's okay now.
L291539	u5925	m391	SARA	He's gotta still be down here.
L291538	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Price!!
L291529	u5925	m391	SARA	It'll have to do.
L291528	u5918	m391	EDDIE	This is the best we're gonna do.
L291495	u5925	m391	SARA	What about that other guy?
L291494	u5918	m391	EDDIE	That's crazy!
L291493	u5925	m391	SARA	Or an on-line computer.
L291487	u5925	m391	SARA	Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
L291486	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Wait a minute... What are you saying?
L291485	u5925	m391	SARA	Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
L291484	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Better living through electricity.
L291483	u5925	m391	SARA	Cheery looking bunch.
L291481	u5925	m391	SARA	Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
L291480	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What are you looking for?
L291477	u5925	m391	SARA	Let's try down here...
L291476	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Good point.
L291475	u5925	m391	SARA	Back where?
L291474	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I think we should have taken a right back there.
L291452	u5925	m391	SARA	-- listen to the man --
L291451	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- you lose either way, Price --
L291415	u5925	m391	SARA	-- where the hell were you?
L291414	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- that's the fact, bud --
L291413	u5925	m391	SARA	I was upstairs with Eddie --
L291378	u5925	m391	SARA	You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
L291377	u5918	m391	EDDIE	-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
L291376	u5925	m391	SARA	-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
L291375	u5918	m391	EDDIE	No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
L291374	u5925	m391	SARA	It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
L291373	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
L291372	u5925	m391	SARA	We can do it...
L291365	u5925	m391	SARA	No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
L291364	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You hear somebody?
L291321	u5918	m391	EDDIE	And then where are we?
L291320	u5925	m391	SARA	An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
L291319	u5918	m391	EDDIE	What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
L291318	u5925	m391	SARA	Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
L291317	u5918	m391	EDDIE	How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
L291308	u5925	m391	SARA	No...not air --
L291307	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
L291252	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
L291251	u5925	m391	SARA	There's always exceptions.
L291250	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
L291249	u5925	m391	SARA	Why not?
L291248	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I don't think so...
L291247	u5925	m391	SARA	I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
L291246	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
L291245	u5925	m391	SARA	What? Deep down inside?
L291243	u5925	m391	SARA	You need to get out more.
L291242	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Most fun I've had all day.
L291241	u5925	m391	SARA	Thanks.
L291238	u5925	m391	SARA	This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
L291237	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Why?
L291236	u5925	m391	SARA	Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
L291184	u5925	m391	SARA	Don't push it.
L291183	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I'm better than that.
L291182	u5925	m391	SARA	And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
L291027	u5918	m391	EDDIE	I thought she was dead. For sure.
L291026	u5925	m391	SARA	Is she...alright?
L291090	u5922	m391	MELISSA	How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
L291089	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Then what the hell are we doing here?
L291085	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
L291084	u5922	m391	MELISSA	Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
L291042	u5922	m391	MELISSA	I hope not.
L291041	u5918	m391	EDDIE	So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
L291020	u5918	m391	EDDIE	Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
L291019	u5922	m391	MELISSA	...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
L291016	u5922	m391	MELISSA	The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
L291015	u5918	m391	EDDIE	You've got your own TV show?
L291014	u5922	m391	MELISSA	"I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack ""Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos"" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em."
L291001	u5922	m391	MELISSA	So where's the party?
L291000	u5918	m391	EDDIE	...Jesus H. Christ.

L291592	u5923	m391	PRICE	Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
L291591	u5919	m391	EVELYN	No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.

L291588	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --

L291585	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- what...are...you...going...to --
L291584	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
L291583	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Steven --
L291339	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
L291338	u5923	m391	PRICE	They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
L291337	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Question answered.
L291336	u5923	m391	PRICE	Jesus!
L291334	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
L291333	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
L291332	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
L291331	u5923	m391	PRICE	If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
L291330	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- and who's next on your list?
L291329	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- I pose you the same question --
L291328	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
L291327	u5923	m391	PRICE	Asking the wrong person again.
L291326	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
L291289	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Stalking the wild poltergeist.
L291288	u5923	m391	PRICE	Where is she?
L291287	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
L291177	u5923	m391	PRICE	A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
L291176	u5919	m391	EVELYN	And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
L291171	u5923	m391	PRICE	Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
L291170	u5919	m391	EVELYN	So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
L291163	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
L291162	u5923	m391	PRICE	What are you talking about?
L291152	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- in the act.
L291151	u5919	m391	EVELYN	-- the sadistic prick --
L291150	u5923	m391	PRICE	Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
L291149	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Really? Well, let it rip.
L291148	u5923	m391	PRICE	Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
L291147	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
L291146	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
L291066	u5919	m391	EVELYN	My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
L291065	u5923	m391	PRICE	Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
L291064	u5923	m391	PRICE	I know.
L291063	u5919	m391	EVELYN	You're hurting me.
L291062	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- just not always in the sexual sense.
L291061	u5923	m391	PRICE	You know everything you do gets me hot.
L291060	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
L291059	u5923	m391	PRICE	You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
L291058	u5919	m391	EVELYN	All accidents until proven otherwise.
L291057	u5923	m391	PRICE	"Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The ""O.J."" knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your ""Jim Jones Kool- Aid"" that was exactly that?"
L291056	u5919	m391	EVELYN	It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
L291055	u5923	m391	PRICE	Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
L291054	u5919	m391	EVELYN	What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
L291053	u5923	m391	PRICE	You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
L291052	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Then who are they?
L291051	u5923	m391	PRICE	Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
L291050	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
L291049	u5923	m391	PRICE	Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
L291048	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
L291039	u5923	m391	PRICE	Oh, I think we're going to have several.
L291038	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Could we have a word?
L291036	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Haven't they already?
L291035	u5923	m391	PRICE	You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
L291034	u5919	m391	EVELYN	I'm not laughing, Steven.
L291033	u5923	m391	PRICE	I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
L291032	u5919	m391	EVELYN	Don't touch me!
L290945	u5919	m391	EVELYN	"Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: ""Haunted Hill"" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --"
L290944	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
L290971	u5920	m391	JENZEN	Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
L290970	u5925	m391	SARA	...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
L290968	u5920	m391	JENZEN	And here's your goddamn severance!
L290967	u5925	m391	SARA	What?
L290966	u5920	m391	JENZEN	-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
L290965	u5925	m391	SARA	No, no, it's just --
L290964	u5920	m391	JENZEN	You think this is fucking funny??
L290957	u5920	m391	JENZEN	-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
L290956	u5925	m391	SARA	I was in the middle of --
L290955	u5920	m391	JENZEN	You didn't think to ask?
L290954	u5925	m391	SARA	Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
L290953	u5920	m391	JENZEN	Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
L290952	u5925	m391	SARA	I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
L290932	u5923	m391	PRICE	Maybe if I --
L290931	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Please! Something! Oh-God!
L290929	u5923	m391	PRICE	Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
L290928	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Do something!
L290921	u5923	m391	PRICE	I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
L290920	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	First time for everything.
L290916	u5923	m391	PRICE	I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
L290915	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
L290913	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think it's something better experienced then described.
L290912	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	And then what happens?
L290911	u5923	m391	PRICE	Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
L290909	u5923	m391	PRICE	Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
L290908	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	"Your roller coaster that is, quote: ""unlike any that has ever come before it."""
L290907	u5923	m391	PRICE	My wife. Where were we?
L290906	u5921	m391	KIRSTEN	Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
L291597	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I am.
L291596	u5923	m391	PRICE	He was right! Pritchett was right!
L291440	u5923	m391	PRICE	Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
L291439	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Vannacutt!!
L291432	u5923	m391	PRICE	Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
L291431	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
L291410	u5923	m391	PRICE	"I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as ""ghosts."" This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --"
L291409	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	House 2, Guests 0.
L291356	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
L291355	u5923	m391	PRICE	What?
L291354	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I think...I may have the answer.
L291136	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
L291135	u5923	m391	PRICE	Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
L291101	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
L291100	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- even if I give you a million as well?
L291099	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- my loss --
L291098	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
L291097	u5923	m391	PRICE	Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
L291096	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
L291080	u5923	m391	PRICE	Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
L291079	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I'm ready now.
L291031	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I can't remember at the moment.
L291030	u5923	m391	PRICE	She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
L291562	u5925	m391	SARA	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
L291561	u5923	m391	PRICE	Please! I need your help.
L291560	u5925	m391	SARA	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
L291559	u5923	m391	PRICE	Then tell me, please -- help me...!
L291454	u5925	m391	SARA	-- no more --
L291453	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- listen to me, goddamnit --

L291449	u5925	m391	SARA	-- confirming everything we already know --
L291448	u5923	m391	PRICE	Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
L291444	u5923	m391	PRICE	Well, I can't, sweetheart.
L291443	u5925	m391	SARA	I'll take my chances.
L291442	u5923	m391	PRICE	"Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the ""Saturation Chamber."""
L291441	u5925	m391	SARA	Well, I don't.
L291436	u5923	m391	PRICE	I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
L291435	u5925	m391	SARA	Fascinated.
L291434	u5923	m391	PRICE	Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
L291433	u5925	m391	SARA	If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
L291425	u5925	m391	SARA	I never saw you --
L291424	u5923	m391	PRICE	I was upstairs!
L291422	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
L291421	u5925	m391	SARA	-- the window and door grates --
L291406	u5923	m391	PRICE	I think I'll do what I damn well please.
L291405	u5925	m391	SARA	I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
L291382	u5923	m391	PRICE	Something with the power, I don't know!!
L291381	u5925	m391	SARA	What is it??
L291211	u5923	m391	PRICE	I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
L291210	u5925	m391	SARA	Good way to get your head blown off.
L291209	u5923	m391	PRICE	Sorry.
L291095	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
L291094	u5925	m391	SARA	This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
L291088	u5923	m391	PRICE	Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
L291087	u5925	m391	SARA	Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
L291074	u5923	m391	PRICE	Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
L291073	u5925	m391	SARA	What're you talking about?
L291072	u5923	m391	PRICE	You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
L291071	u5925	m391	SARA	Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
L291198	u5923	m391	PRICE	Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
L291197	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
L291196	u5923	m391	PRICE	No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
L291195	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
L291194	u5923	m391	PRICE	It works.
L291193	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
L291192	u5923	m391	PRICE	Then who did??
L291191	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
L291190	u5923	m391	PRICE	Rewind that.
L291189	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	-- it wasn't me.
L291188	u5923	m391	PRICE	I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
L291187	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	The lockdown thing.
L291186	u5923	m391	PRICE	-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
L290941	u5923	m391	PRICE	So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
L290940	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Dummy 6 keeps losing his arm.
L290939	u5923	m391	PRICE	Problem where? Looked good to me.
L290938	u5923	m391	PRICE	Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
L290937	u5926	m391	SCHECTER	Houston, I think we may have a problem.
L291643	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	-- ten.
L291642	u5925	m391	SARA	-- hey! --
L291606	u5925	m391	SARA	How, he's supposed to be dead!
L291605	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	He must've unsealed the room!
L291604	u5925	m391	SARA	Pritchett: what is going on?
L291544	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Oh, dear.
L291543	u5925	m391	SARA	Price!
L291533	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	He would have been back by now.
L291532	u5925	m391	SARA	Excuse me?
L291531	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Blackburn's dead.
L291530	u5925	m391	SARA	You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
L291284	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
L291283	u5925	m391	SARA	"Pritchett, what is this ""core of darkness""?"
L291282	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
L291281	u5925	m391	SARA	There is something very not normal going on here!
L291220	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
L291219	u5925	m391	SARA	And you think it's in there?
L291218	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
L291217	u5925	m391	SARA	Ghosts killed your father?
L291207	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
L291206	u5925	m391	SARA	You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
L291159	u5925	m391	SARA	Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
L291158	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
L291157	u5925	m391	SARA	No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
L291156	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
L291155	u5925	m391	SARA	"Pritchett, this ""lockdown"" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?"
L291154	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Believe me, we need to.
L291153	u5925	m391	SARA	Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
L291134	u5925	m391	SARA	Why not?
L291133	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Won't do any good.
L291130	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
L291129	u5925	m391	SARA	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
L291128	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Don't know that it does.
L291103	u5925	m391	SARA	What's going on?
L291102	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Oh, no.
L291044	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	I can't comment until I get paid.
L291043	u5925	m391	SARA	Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
L290992	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	He must've beaten us all here!
L290991	u5925	m391	SARA	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
L290990	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	Wish I could take the credit, but --
L290985	u5924	m391	PRITCHETT	It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
L290984	u5925	m391	SARA	But the million bucks each, that's for real?
L291555	u5927	m391	VOICE	-- something horrible...I don't understand --
L291554	u5925	m391	SARA	-- I'm coming --
L291553	u5927	m391	VOICE	Something....happened --
L291552	u5925	m391	SARA	Keep talking, I'll find you!
L291551	u5927	m391	VOICE	Sara...?

L291549	u5927	m391	VOICE	For the love of God....please...?
L291548	u5925	m391	SARA	Melissa...?

L304899	u6000	m398	CHIEF NYBACK	About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
L304898	u6009	m398	WILL	And then I lost him.  In the fog.
L304718	u6000	m398	CHIEF NYBACK	Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
L304717	u6009	m398	WILL	That's I.A.'s pit bull.

L304710	u6000	m398	CHIEF NYBACK	What's the D.A. got them on?
L304709	u6009	m398	WILL	So far.
L304705	u6000	m398	CHIEF NYBACK	Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
L304704	u6009	m398	WILL	Nice kid.
L304695	u6000	m398	CHIEF NYBACK	What's that, then?
L304694	u6009	m398	WILL	Just after Leland Street.
L305359	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
L305358	u6009	m398	WILL	What about your shoulder?
L305353	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Why?
L305352	u6009	m398	WILL	No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
L305348	u6009	m398	WILL	Byrd's dead.
L305347	u6001	m398	ELLIE	I know.
L305346	u6009	m398	WILL	Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
L305277	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Worth pursuing?
L305276	u6009	m398	WILL	It's legitimate.
L305149	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
L305148	u6009	m398	WILL	Not really.
L305147	u6001	m398	ELLIE	About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
L305146	u6009	m398	WILL	Duggar called him?
L305039	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Five feet?  Seven feet?
L305038	u6009	m398	WILL	I don't remember.
L305037	u6001	m398	ELLIE	How much closer would you say you were?
L305036	u6009	m398	WILL	Then change it.
L305035	u6001	m398	ELLIE	But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
L305003	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Okay.
L305002	u6009	m398	WILL	I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
L304999	u6001	m398	ELLIE	That must have been awful for you.
L304998	u6009	m398	WILL	It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
L304997	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Oh, I shouldn't have...
L304995	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Twelve years younger.
L304994	u6009	m398	WILL	She your only sibling?
L304992	u6001	m398	ELLIE	The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
L304991	u6009	m398	WILL	Who's playing?
L304990	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
L304989	u6009	m398	WILL	I could say the same thing about you.
L304871	u6009	m398	WILL	Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
L304870	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Yeah.  All over.
L304869	u6009	m398	WILL	This murder was in the papers, right?
L304841	u6009	m398	WILL	Good.  He's up next.
L304840	u6001	m398	ELLIE	The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
L304839	u6009	m398	WILL	Who's that?
L304836	u6001	m398	ELLIE	But there wasn't any...
L304835	u6009	m398	WILL	Do it again.
L304834	u6001	m398	ELLIE	We already did.
L304833	u6009	m398	WILL	I want you to check this out, Ellie.
L304790	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
L304789	u6009	m398	WILL	Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
L304785	u6009	m398	WILL	It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
L304784	u6001	m398	ELLIE	But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
L304783	u6009	m398	WILL	Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
L304727	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Don't worry about him...
L304726	u6009	m398	WILL	Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
L304687	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Actually...
L304686	u6009	m398	WILL	You did your homework, Officer.
L304682	u6001	m398	ELLIE	Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
L304681	u6009	m398	WILL	My partner...
L304956	u6002	m398	FARRELL	We'll get the other one, though.
L304955	u6009	m398	WILL	Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
L304954	u6002	m398	FARRELL	Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
L304947	u6009	m398	WILL	Anything.  It's important.
L304946	u6002	m398	FARRELL	What I saw?
L304945	u6009	m398	WILL	That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
L304944	u6002	m398	FARRELL	We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
L304943	u6009	m398	WILL	He would have liked that.
L304942	u6002	m398	FARRELL	I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
L304941	u6009	m398	WILL	Thanks.
L304890	u6009	m398	WILL	Where is he?
L304889	u6002	m398	FARRELL	Sorry about...
L305105	u6003	m398	FRED	This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
L305104	u6009	m398	WILL	So?
L305103	u6003	m398	FRED	Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
L305102	u6009	m398	WILL	That's right.
L305101	u6003	m398	FRED	One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
L305100	u6009	m398	WILL	No.
L305099	u6003	m398	FRED	And something else that might interest you.
L305098	u6009	m398	WILL	Good.
L305097	u6003	m398	FRED	I beeped you over two hours ago.
L305096	u6009	m398	WILL	What?
L305095	u6003	m398	FRED	Forget your pager?
L305018	u6009	m398	WILL	First I need a copy of the key.
L305017	u6003	m398	FRED	I'll call him now.
L304935	u6009	m398	WILL	I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
L304934	u6003	m398	FRED	Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
L304878	u6009	m398	WILL	I told her to come.
L304877	u6003	m398	FRED	What are you doing here?
L304865	u6009	m398	WILL	No.
L304864	u6003	m398	FRED	I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
L304859	u6003	m398	FRED	Has her books in it.
L304858	u6009	m398	WILL	We're sure it's hers?
L304796	u6003	m398	FRED	Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
L304795	u6009	m398	WILL	Who was the last one to see her alive?
L304794	u6003	m398	FRED	Around twelve-thirty.
L304793	u6009	m398	WILL	What time was that?
L304792	u6003	m398	FRED	She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
L304739	u6003	m398	FRED	Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
L304738	u6009	m398	WILL	No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
L304737	u6003	m398	FRED	No.
L305221	u6008	m398	WALTER	She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
L305220	u6003	m398	FRED	Are you sure about that?
L305215	u6008	m398	WALTER	That's right.
L305214	u6003	m398	FRED	Randy Stetz?
L305213	u6008	m398	WALTER	That boyfriend.  Randy.
L305212	u6003	m398	FRED	How do you mean?
L305211	u6008	m398	WALTER	She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
L305193	u6008	m398	WALTER	Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
L305192	u6003	m398	FRED	Did she?
L305191	u6008	m398	WALTER	She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
L305190	u6003	m398	FRED	What happened at that signing?
L305189	u6008	m398	WALTER	That's right.
L305188	u6003	m398	FRED	Where you signed this?
L304851	u6009	m398	WILL	You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
L304850	u6004	m398	HAP	You don't have to be involved, Will.
L304849	u6009	m398	WILL	Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
L304848	u6004	m398	HAP	I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
L304847	u6009	m398	WILL	Don't do this, Hap...
L304846	u6004	m398	HAP	I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
L304845	u6004	m398	HAP	Will?
L304844	u6009	m398	WILL	Looks like the natives are restless.
L304800	u6004	m398	HAP	What are we thinking?
L304799	u6009	m398	WILL	Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
L304774	u6009	m398	WILL	Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
L304773	u6004	m398	HAP	Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
L304772	u6009	m398	WILL	No way.
L304771	u6004	m398	HAP	Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
L304770	u6009	m398	WILL	One word to I.A. and he walks.
L304769	u6004	m398	HAP	You know I remember that.
L304768	u6009	m398	WILL	Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
L304766	u6009	m398	WILL	We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
L304765	u6004	m398	HAP	Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
L304764	u6009	m398	WILL	He's just rattling your cage.
L304763	u6004	m398	HAP	But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
L304762	u6009	m398	WILL	He's asking everybody questions.
L304761	u6004	m398	HAP	Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
L304760	u6009	m398	WILL	That's right.
L304759	u6004	m398	HAP	To do nothing.
L304758	u6009	m398	WILL	You know my plan of action.
L304757	u6004	m398	HAP	When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
L304756	u6009	m398	WILL	We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
L304755	u6004	m398	HAP	You know what about.
L304754	u6009	m398	WILL	What do you want to talk about?
L304741	u6004	m398	HAP	Even the best make mistakes.
L304740	u6009	m398	WILL	He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
L304715	u6004	m398	HAP	"I.A.'s calling themselves the ""Corruption Task Force.""  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or ""oversights"" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night."
L304714	u6009	m398	WILL	They're all over everybody.
L304697	u6009	m398	WILL	Seven years.
L304696	u6004	m398	HAP	Eight years.
L305178	u6009	m398	WILL	We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
L305177	u6005	m398	RACHEL	What if someone finds out?
L305176	u6009	m398	WILL	There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
L305175	u6005	m398	RACHEL	Will.
L305172	u6009	m398	WILL	Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
L305171	u6005	m398	RACHEL	One of your cases?
L305162	u6005	m398	RACHEL	There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
L305161	u6009	m398	WILL	What is it?
L305160	u6005	m398	RACHEL	Will...I...
L304986	u6009	m398	WILL	What did he look like?
L304985	u6005	m398	RACHEL	That's not what he thinks.
L304984	u6009	m398	WILL	I'm not expecting anyone.
L304983	u6005	m398	RACHEL	No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
L304982	u6009	m398	WILL	Fred Duggar?
L304981	u6009	m398	WILL	Habit.
L304980	u6005	m398	RACHEL	I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
L304749	u6009	m398	WILL	I'm always all business.
L304748	u6005	m398	RACHEL	Your friend's all business.
L305050	u6009	m398	WILL	Good to see you, too, Randy.
L305049	u6006	m398	RANDY	Thought I smelled something.
L304830	u6006	m398	RANDY	She didn't tell me.
L304829	u6009	m398	WILL	You don't know.
L304828	u6006	m398	RANDY	I don't know.
L304826	u6006	m398	RANDY	Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
L304825	u6009	m398	WILL	Ran like hell to go to him...
L304824	u6006	m398	RANDY	How should I know?...
L304823	u6009	m398	WILL	After that she left the party to go to him.
L304822	u6006	m398	RANDY	I told you I don't remember.
L304821	u6009	m398	WILL	The other guy?
L304820	u6006	m398	RANDY	Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
L304819	u6009	m398	WILL	What kind of stuff?
L304818	u6006	m398	RANDY	Stuff.
L304817	u6009	m398	WILL	Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
L304816	u6006	m398	RANDY	I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
L304815	u6009	m398	WILL	But she was seeing someone else on the side.
L304814	u6006	m398	RANDY	She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
L304813	u6009	m398	WILL	You heard me that time.
L304812	u6006	m398	RANDY	Huh?
L304811	u6009	m398	WILL	She was nice.  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
L304809	u6009	m398	WILL	Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
L304808	u6006	m398	RANDY	Huh?
L304807	u6009	m398	WILL	Did you love her?
L305091	u6007	m398	TANYA	Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
L305090	u6009	m398	WILL	What was it?
L305089	u6007	m398	TANYA	She used some stupid code name.
L305088	u6009	m398	WILL	Who?
L305087	u6007	m398	TANYA	My arm!
L305086	u6009	m398	WILL	Who?
L305085	u6007	m398	TANYA	She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
L305084	u6009	m398	WILL	What was?
L305083	u6007	m398	TANYA	It was like some big fucking secret!
L305082	u6009	m398	WILL	But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
L305081	u6007	m398	TANYA	She wouldn't tell me!
L305080	u6009	m398	WILL	You don't know.
L305079	u6007	m398	TANYA	I don't know.
L305078	u6009	m398	WILL	Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
L305077	u6007	m398	TANYA	No...
L305076	u6009	m398	WILL	Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
L305075	u6007	m398	TANYA	That's what I said.
L305074	u6009	m398	WILL	You and Kay were like sisters?
L305071	u6009	m398	WILL	Thought you wanted something fun...
L305070	u6007	m398	TANYA	Hey...
L305068	u6007	m398	TANYA	Long as it's fun.
L305067	u6009	m398	WILL	You want me to take you somewhere?
L305063	u6009	m398	WILL	Must be tough for you.  What happened.
L305062	u6007	m398	TANYA	We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
L305061	u6009	m398	WILL	That's a long time.
L305060	u6007	m398	TANYA	Since grade school.
L305059	u6009	m398	WILL	Best friend?
L305058	u6007	m398	TANYA	I was her best friend.
L305056	u6007	m398	TANYA	What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
L305055	u6009	m398	WILL	You're not missing much.
L305054	u6007	m398	TANYA	I never met anyone from Seattle before.
L305338	u6009	m398	WILL	Drop the gun, Walter.
L305337	u6008	m398	WALTER	Wild card.
L305330	u6009	m398	WILL	Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
L305329	u6008	m398	WALTER	You're not following procedure.
L305328	u6009	m398	WILL	No back-up.
L305327	u6008	m398	WALTER	Where's your back-up?
L305304	u6008	m398	WALTER	If you want it to be...
L305303	u6009	m398	WILL	This an accident, Walter?
L305302	u6008	m398	WALTER	Yes.  Like that.
L305300	u6008	m398	WALTER	It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
L305299	u6009	m398	WILL	Couldn't get it up, Walter?
L305298	u6008	m398	WALTER	I didn't want to kill her, Will.
L305297	u6009	m398	WILL	Don't you pull that shit with me.
L305296	u6008	m398	WALTER	Then so was mine...
L305295	u6009	m398	WILL	I told you that was an accident!
L305294	u6008	m398	WALTER	Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
L305293	u6009	m398	WILL	What the hell do you know?
L305290	u6008	m398	WALTER	But we work so well together...
L305289	u6009	m398	WILL	There's nothing more to talk about.
L305288	u6008	m398	WALTER	I thought maybe we could talk some more.
L305287	u6009	m398	WILL	Congratulations.
L305286	u6008	m398	WALTER	Told you I could write an ending.
L305285	u6009	m398	WILL	Randy Stetz is in jail.
L305217	u6008	m398	WALTER	He.  Well, he...
L305216	u6009	m398	WILL	What about him?
L305209	u6008	m398	WALTER	I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
L305208	u6009	m398	WILL	Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
L305207	u6008	m398	WALTER	Yes.
L305206	u6009	m398	WILL	Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
L305205	u6008	m398	WALTER	Yes.
L305204	u6009	m398	WILL	You gave her gifts.
L305203	u6008	m398	WALTER	I was a mentor to her.
L305202	u6009	m398	WILL	But you wanted to.
L305201	u6008	m398	WALTER	No.
L305200	u6009	m398	WILL	Did you have sex with her?
L305199	u6008	m398	WALTER	I suppose.
L305198	u6009	m398	WILL	But she was an attractive girl.
L305197	u6008	m398	WALTER	She was only seventeen.
L305134	u6009	m398	WILL	Yes down at the station.
L305133	u6008	m398	WALTER	Down at the station?
L305132	u6009	m398	WILL	You're going to be brought in for questioning.
L305131	u6008	m398	WALTER	Thought you might find that.
L305130	u6009	m398	WILL	Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
L305129	u6008	m398	WALTER	Oh?
L305128	u6009	m398	WILL	I said you're going to get a phone call.
L305127	u6008	m398	WALTER	I'm sorry?
L305122	u6009	m398	WILL	The phone call.  The knapsack.
L305121	u6008	m398	WALTER	No game.
L308511	u6016	m400	BROOKS	I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
L308510	u6020	m400	KARLA	What the hell would you call this?
L308509	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Sorry. Emergencies only.
L308508	u6020	m400	KARLA	What about a radio?
L308507	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
L308347	u6016	m400	BROOKS	July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
L308346	u6020	m400	KARLA	Wait...Did you say off-season?
L308345	u6016	m400	BROOKS	And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
L308344	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
L308340	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
L308339	u6020	m400	KARLA	Is that bad?
L308338	u6016	m400	BROOKS	You're in 201 and 202.
L308327	u6020	m400	KARLA	Checking in...Karla Wilson.
L308326	u6016	m400	BROOKS	What can I do for you?
L308505	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Phones went down a few minutes ago.
L308504	u6019	m400	JULIE	Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
L308501	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
L308500	u6019	m400	JULIE	I want off this island.
L308489	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Who? Who is here?
L308488	u6019	m400	JULIE	Listen to me. He's here.
L308349	u6016	m400	BROOKS	It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
L308348	u6019	m400	JULIE	Storm season?
L308343	u6019	m400	JULIE	We haven't exchanged anything.
L308342	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
L308341	u6019	m400	JULIE	Your what?
L308334	u6016	m400	BROOKS	Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
L308333	u6019	m400	JULIE	It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
L308262	u6017	m400	DAVE	The guy looks dead.
L308261	u6024	m400	RAY	No.
L308260	u6017	m400	DAVE	I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
L308258	u6017	m400	DAVE	No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
L308257	u6024	m400	RAY	I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
L308256	u6017	m400	DAVE	Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
L308254	u6017	m400	DAVE	Stupid. What were you thinkng?
L308253	u6024	m400	RAY	Stupid. Stupid.
L308243	u6017	m400	DAVE	Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
L308242	u6024	m400	RAY	You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
L308453	u6025	m400	TITUS	Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
L308452	u6018	m400	DERRICK	I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
L308451	u6025	m400	TITUS	Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
L308450	u6018	m400	DERRICK	There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
L308449	u6025	m400	TITUS	That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
L308448	u6018	m400	DERRICK	Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
L308447	u6025	m400	TITUS	Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
L308446	u6018	m400	DERRICK	Get lost, you scared me.
L308758	u6020	m400	KARLA	Is he?
L308757	u6019	m400	JULIE	You're okay. Thank god.
L308756	u6020	m400	KARLA	Oh, god, it's you --
L308713	u6020	m400	KARLA	...Nancy?
L308712	u6019	m400	JULIE	No, you're not.
L308711	u6020	m400	KARLA	I'm holding your hand!
L308708	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm right here. Grab my hand.
L308707	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie?
L308705	u6019	m400	JULIE	Come on, you can make it.
L308704	u6020	m400	KARLA	I don't know...
L308682	u6020	m400	KARLA	What do we do?
L308681	u6019	m400	JULIE	There's no way to lock it.
L308657	u6020	m400	KARLA	It's too late for that.
L308656	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
L308655	u6020	m400	KARLA	I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
L308643	u6019	m400	JULIE	Then, we fight --
L308642	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
L308638	u6019	m400	JULIE	I've got to see.
L308637	u6020	m400	KARLA	Be careful, Julie.
L308626	u6019	m400	JULIE	We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
L308625	u6020	m400	KARLA	I know I don't want to stay in here.
L308616	u6019	m400	JULIE	Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
L308615	u6020	m400	KARLA	What do you mean?
L308612	u6020	m400	KARLA	Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
L308611	u6019	m400	JULIE	Let him go. I believe him.
L308584	u6019	m400	JULIE	Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
L308583	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie...
L308582	u6019	m400	JULIE	They never found the body.
L308581	u6020	m400	KARLA	Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
L308570	u6020	m400	KARLA	I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
L308569	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
L308551	u6020	m400	KARLA	Just kidding.
L308550	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla!
L308547	u6020	m400	KARLA	No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
L308546	u6019	m400	JULIE	Cancer in a box.
L308535	u6020	m400	KARLA	I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
L308534	u6019	m400	JULIE	Nice move.
L308533	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
L308532	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
L308525	u6019	m400	JULIE	Some.
L308524	u6020	m400	KARLA	You get any sleep at all?
L308497	u6019	m400	JULIE	The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
L308496	u6020	m400	KARLA	Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
L308419	u6019	m400	JULIE	Not me...no way...
L308418	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yes.
L308417	u6019	m400	JULIE	No.
L308416	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yes.
L308415	u6019	m400	JULIE	No way.
L308411	u6020	m400	KARLA	Okay, I won't.
L308410	u6019	m400	JULIE	Don't even think about it.
L308409	u6020	m400	KARLA	Karaoke -- perfect.
L308397	u6019	m400	JULIE	I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
L308396	u6020	m400	KARLA	He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
L308395	u6019	m400	JULIE	Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
L308366	u6020	m400	KARLA	I also promised Tyrell.
L308365	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla! You promised.
L308364	u6020	m400	KARLA	Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
L308324	u6019	m400	JULIE	Where is everyone? I'll ask --
L308323	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hello? Hello?
L308296	u6019	m400	JULIE	I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
L308295	u6020	m400	KARLA	Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
L308294	u6020	m400	KARLA	No, I'm the King of the World.
L308293	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm the King of the World.
L308278	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
L308277	u6019	m400	JULIE	Oh!
L308275	u6019	m400	JULIE	Then, don't.
L308274	u6020	m400	KARLA	Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
L308273	u6019	m400	JULIE	He does work hard.
L308272	u6020	m400	KARLA	He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
L308271	u6019	m400	JULIE	But, he said he'd try.
L308270	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, you left four messages... Four.
L308269	u6019	m400	JULIE	He's not coming. I thought he was just...
L308246	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
L308245	u6020	m400	KARLA	You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
L308209	u6020	m400	KARLA	I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
L308208	u6019	m400	JULIE	Okay, okay. You're right.
L308207	u6020	m400	KARLA	Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
L308206	u6019	m400	JULIE	The number's unlisted...
L308205	u6020	m400	KARLA	Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
L308204	u6019	m400	JULIE	That could break the machine.
L308195	u6020	m400	KARLA	Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
L308194	u6019	m400	JULIE	Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
L308191	u6019	m400	JULIE	Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
L308190	u6020	m400	KARLA	No means yes.
L308189	u6019	m400	JULIE	No.
L308188	u6020	m400	KARLA	Say yes.
L308176	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yet. Nothing yet.
L308175	u6019	m400	JULIE	There's nothing between Will and me.
L308174	u6020	m400	KARLA	Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
L308173	u6019	m400	JULIE	I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
L308172	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yeah, right -- whatever.
L308171	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
L308170	u6020	m400	KARLA	No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
L308169	u6019	m400	JULIE	That was heart attack time, Karla.
L308168	u6020	m400	KARLA	i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
L308167	u6019	m400	JULIE	What are you doing in my closet?
L308166	u6020	m400	KARLA	I thought you were out of town!
L308165	u6019	m400	JULIE	What are you doing in my closet?
L308164	u6020	m400	KARLA	I thought you were out of town!
L308767	u6019	m400	JULIE	You know me to well.
L308766	u6024	m400	RAY	Checking the locks again?
L308765	u6024	m400	RAY	It's gonna be great.
L308764	u6019	m400	JULIE	I love it here.
L308763	u6024	m400	RAY	Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
L308762	u6019	m400	JULIE	Never do that again.
L308761	u6024	m400	RAY	Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
L308760	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray...what are you doing?
L308250	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
L308249	u6024	m400	RAY	Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
L308248	u6019	m400	JULIE	Will you try...for me, please?
L308247	u6024	m400	RAY	Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
L308241	u6024	m400	RAY	This weekend?
L308240	u6019	m400	JULIE	We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
L308239	u6024	m400	RAY	What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
L308238	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
L308236	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's okay.
L308235	u6024	m400	RAY	No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
L308234	u6019	m400	JULIE	No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
L308233	u6024	m400	RAY	Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
L308158	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
L308157	u6024	m400	RAY	I understand something.
L308156	u6019	m400	JULIE	I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
L308155	u6024	m400	RAY	Can't what?
L308154	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, I can't...
L308152	u6019	m400	JULIE	Why are you being like this?
L308151	u6024	m400	RAY	Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
L308150	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ray, we're just friend.
L308149	u6024	m400	RAY	Yeah.
L308148	u6019	m400	JULIE	Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
L308147	u6024	m400	RAY	I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
L308669	u6019	m400	JULIE	Wait, it's Nancy --
L308668	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Don't kill me --
L308619	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
L308618	u6019	m400	JULIE	I don't know.
L308617	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
L308596	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I told you.
L308595	u6019	m400	JULIE	Voodoo.
L308580	u6019	m400	JULIE	Ben Willis.
L308579	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Who?
L308578	u6019	m400	JULIE	We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
L308495	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Fine. Show me the body.
L308494	u6019	m400	JULIE	I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
L308187	u6026	m400	TYRELL	That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
L308186	u6019	m400	JULIE	Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
L308185	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
L308741	u6027	m400	WILL	Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
L308740	u6019	m400	JULIE	...Why?
L308739	u6027	m400	WILL	We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
L308738	u6019	m400	JULIE	I trusted you.
L308737	u6027	m400	WILL	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
L308736	u6019	m400	JULIE	Why are you doing this to me?
L308721	u6027	m400	WILL	I guess so.
L308720	u6019	m400	JULIE	He's in it with Willis?
L308719	u6027	m400	WILL	Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
L308718	u6019	m400	JULIE	Did you get help?
L308717	u6027	m400	WILL	Come on. We're gonna be okay.
L308486	u6019	m400	JULIE	I wasn't dreaming.
L308485	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
L308484	u6019	m400	JULIE	There was a body! I swear it!
L308482	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's in my room!
L308481	u6027	m400	WILL	What? What are you talking about? Where?
L308436	u6019	m400	JULIE	Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
L308435	u6027	m400	WILL	Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
L308434	u6019	m400	JULIE	No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
L308433	u6027	m400	WILL	I scared you -- I crossed the line --
L308432	u6019	m400	JULIE	No, no, no. This was really sweet...
L308431	u6027	m400	WILL	It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
L308430	u6019	m400	JULIE	Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
L308427	u6019	m400	JULIE	He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
L308426	u6027	m400	WILL	What do you mean, Julie?
L308425	u6019	m400	JULIE	It's...him.
L308424	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie? What's wrong?
L308373	u6027	m400	WILL	You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
L308372	u6019	m400	JULIE	Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
L308371	u6027	m400	WILL	You sure it's okay with you?
L308353	u6019	m400	JULIE	It beets being on the mainland.
L308352	u6027	m400	WILL	And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
L308290	u6027	m400	WILL	Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
L308289	u6019	m400	JULIE	You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
L308288	u6027	m400	WILL	Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
L308287	u6019	m400	JULIE	Deep breaths --
L308286	u6027	m400	WILL	What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
L308285	u6019	m400	JULIE	Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
L308198	u6027	m400	WILL	I said, this...Do you want a drink?
L308197	u6019	m400	JULIE	What?
L308196	u6027	m400	WILL	This was not my idea.
L308143	u6027	m400	WILL	Are you sure?
L308142	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm okay.
L308141	u6027	m400	WILL	Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
L308140	u6019	m400	JULIE	Right. Now I remember.
L308139	u6027	m400	WILL	To get out of Southport?
L308138	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
L308137	u6027	m400	WILL	It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
L308136	u6019	m400	JULIE	It was one year ago...
L308135	u6019	m400	JULIE	It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
L308134	u6027	m400	WILL	It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
L308133	u6019	m400	JULIE	I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
L308132	u6027	m400	WILL	I'm sorry.
L308131	u6019	m400	JULIE	It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
L308130	u6027	m400	WILL	The shower again?
L308128	u6027	m400	WILL	You don't seem fine.
L308127	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm fine.
L308126	u6027	m400	WILL	You sure?
L308125	u6019	m400	JULIE	I'm fine.
L308124	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie! Wait! You okay?
L308661	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I don't know, but I'm starving.
L308660	u6020	m400	KARLA	You think that's a good place to hide?
L308653	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
L308652	u6020	m400	KARLA	Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
L308650	u6020	m400	KARLA	Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
L308649	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'll come with you.
L308573	u6020	m400	KARLA	We gotta get out of here. Now.
L308572	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
L308528	u6026	m400	TYRELL	See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
L308527	u6020	m400	KARLA	Hey --
L308526	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
L308464	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
L308463	u6020	m400	KARLA	I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
L308460	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
L308459	u6020	m400	KARLA	Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
L308458	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Hello?
L308457	u6020	m400	KARLA	You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
L308441	u6020	m400	KARLA	'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
L308440	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Why?
L308439	u6020	m400	KARLA	Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
L308400	u6020	m400	KARLA	They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
L308399	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Pretty cool bar.
L308362	u6020	m400	KARLA	Rio, baby!
L308361	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Guess the capital of Brazil --
L308355	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
L308354	u6020	m400	KARLA	Oooh, the mainland --
L308351	u6026	m400	TYRELL	We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
L308350	u6020	m400	KARLA	Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
L308292	u6020	m400	KARLA	Honey, some folks just can't fly.
L308291	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
L308282	u6020	m400	KARLA	Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
L308281	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Is there a problem here?
L308193	u6020	m400	KARLA	Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
L308192	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
L308183	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'll talk real slow.
L308182	u6020	m400	KARLA	If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
L308181	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
L308180	u6020	m400	KARLA	I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
L308179	u6026	m400	TYRELL	You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
L308648	u6027	m400	WILL	He's probably the only one who can help us.
L308647	u6020	m400	KARLA	Why? He can't help us.
L308474	u6027	m400	WILL	Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
L308473	u6020	m400	KARLA	How's Julie?
L308472	u6027	m400	WILL	Ahh, that feels great.
L308421	u6020	m400	KARLA	Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
L308420	u6027	m400	WILL	Come on, it'll be fun.
L308405	u6027	m400	WILL	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
L308404	u6020	m400	KARLA	To a great weekend --
L308280	u6020	m400	KARLA	I said we start having fun. And that means now.
L308279	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
L308228	u6022	m400	MARK	We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
L308227	u6020	m400	KARLA	Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
L308225	u6020	m400	KARLA	No. Yes?
L308224	u6022	m400	MARK	Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
L308223	u6020	m400	KARLA	Rio de Janeiro!
L308222	u6022	m400	MARK	Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
L308221	u6020	m400	KARLA	Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
L308215	u6020	m400	KARLA	Yes!
L308214	u6022	m400	MARK	How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
L308213	u6020	m400	KARLA	Well, I'm in school and --
L308212	u6022	m400	MARK	Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
L308211	u6020	m400	KARLA	Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
L308520	u6024	m400	RAY	I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
L308519	u6021	m400	MAC	Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
L308518	u6024	m400	RAY	Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
L308517	u6021	m400	MAC	Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
L308516	u6024	m400	RAY	How much?
L308515	u6021	m400	MAC	Well, there's some flaws in her...
L308514	u6024	m400	RAY	How much?
L308513	u6021	m400	MAC	Jeez, that's a full carat --
L308674	u6023	m400	NANCY	Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
L308673	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Must have missed the sign.
L308672	u6023	m400	NANCY	You stumbled into my hiding place.
L308671	u6026	m400	TYRELL	And so could you -- crazy fool.
L308670	u6023	m400	NANCY	I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
L308493	u6026	m400	TYRELL	The rest of us see bathrobes.
L308492	u6023	m400	NANCY	Cool.
L308491	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
L308490	u6023	m400	NANCY	What's going on?
L308394	u6023	m400	NANCY	No. I shot him.
L308393	u6026	m400	TYRELL	He leave you?
L308392	u6023	m400	NANCY	Not anymore.
L308391	u6026	m400	TYRELL	What's the matter, boy trouble?
L308382	u6023	m400	NANCY	Wanna drink?
L308381	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
L308380	u6023	m400	NANCY	You guys lost?
L308646	u6027	m400	WILL	I'll go find him.
L308645	u6026	m400	TYRELL	What is up with that weirdo?
L308644	u6027	m400	WILL	Where'd Estes go?
L308603	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
L308602	u6027	m400	WILL	We'll only be a second, okay?
L308587	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
L308586	u6027	m400	WILL	The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
L308577	u6027	m400	WILL	Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
L308576	u6026	m400	TYRELL	They were cut loose.
L308559	u6027	m400	WILL	And do what with it?
L308558	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Take this.
L308542	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Hey -- shut up, okay?
L308541	u6027	m400	WILL	You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
L308540	u6026	m400	TYRELL	They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
L308537	u6027	m400	WILL	They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
L308536	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Where is everybody?
L308531	u6027	m400	WILL	You don't have to be a jerk.
L308530	u6026	m400	TYRELL	I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
L308470	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Crowded.
L308469	u6027	m400	WILL	How's the water?
L308468	u6026	m400	TYRELL	There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
L308389	u6027	m400	WILL	So why are you still here?
L308388	u6026	m400	TYRELL	The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
L308384	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
L308383	u6027	m400	WILL	We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
L308299	u6027	m400	WILL	See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
L308298	u6026	m400	TYRELL	Can't talk right now.
L309177	u6029	m401	CATHY	She's in her room.
L309176	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Where is Miss Wollsten?
L308897	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
L308896	u6029	m401	CATHY	How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
L308895	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
L308894	u6029	m401	CATHY	How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
L308893	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -? the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
L309242	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	May life be good to you both. As for the others ?? they will be quiet here ?? and I will be with them.
L309241	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Goodbye.
L309216	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
L309215	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
L309214	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Well ??
L309213	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
L309212	u6033	m401	OLIVER	All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
L309211	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
L309210	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I'll go up and take a look at the General ?- perhaps sit with him.
L309209	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
L309208	u6033	m401	OLIVER	It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
L309183	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	In case you do so, would you --
L309182	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
L308974	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Or even spirit messages from the next world.
L308973	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
L308938	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently ?? walked blindly.
L308934	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	He's dead. I want the General to see him.
L308933	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Drunk again?
L308932	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I need your advice ?? something has happened ?? Mr.  Jacks ??
L308838	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
L308837	u6033	m401	OLIVER	He is exhausted.
L308826	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You collect these to sell, abroad?
L308825	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
L308798	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
L308797	u6033	m401	OLIVER	This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
L308796	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
L309085	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
L309084	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
L309065	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
L309064	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	My friend -- what can one say --
L309063	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	) You feel the symptoms?
L309060	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
L309059	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
L309006	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
L309005	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	We will see who is the first to die.
L309004	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
L309003	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	You're just talking nonsense.
L309002	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
L309001	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
L308998	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
L308997	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
L308995	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Good winds and bad winds!
L308994	u6030	m401	DR. DROSSOS	If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
L309193	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
L309192	u6031	m401	GENERAL	No.  She shall not be left here.
L309191	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
L308960	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
L308959	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
L308958	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
L308944	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was ?- perhaps it was.
L308943	u6031	m401	GENERAL	We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
L308942	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'm not sure that it is the plague.
L308840	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
L308839	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
L308818	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I donut understand.
L308817	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	I'm afraid so. There were rumors ??people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
L308816	u6031	m401	GENERAL	All the graves?
L308815	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	There was some trouble here ??the villagers on the mainland ?-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ??broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
L308814	u6031	m401	GENERAL	But why?
L308813	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	They were gore before I came here.
L308812	u6031	m401	GENERAL	The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
L308800	u6028	m401	ALBRECHT	This was once a cemetery.
L308799	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
L309180	u6029	m401	CATHY	I don't know now without my father.
L309179	u6033	m401	OLIVER	If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
L309094	u6029	m401	CATHY	If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
L309093	u6033	m401	OLIVER	There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
L309092	u6029	m401	CATHY	Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
L309091	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Poor Cathy --
L309090	u6029	m401	CATHY	My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
L309075	u6029	m401	CATHY	Closer and closer ?- until they bite into your throat!
L309074	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
L309073	u6029	m401	CATHY	Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
L309070	u6033	m401	OLIVER	On my word! That's what they believe.
L309069	u6029	m401	CATHY	Oh, no -? it's too delicious! You're making it up!
L309057	u6029	m401	CATHY	I think she went to bed ?? I saw her going toward the house
L309056	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Where's Thea?
L309008	u6029	m401	CATHY	No one can take my father's place.
L309007	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
L308967	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I think not.
L308966	u6029	m401	CATHY	You're not leaving tomorrow..?
L308965	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Sleep well.
L308964	u6029	m401	CATHY	Good night, Oliver.
L308947	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thank you.
L308946	u6033	m401	OLIVER	How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
L308945	u6029	m401	CATHY	I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
L308867	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
L308866	u6029	m401	CATHY	I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
L308862	u6029	m401	CATHY	M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
L308861	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
L308805	u6029	m401	CATHY	That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
L308804	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
L309205	u6031	m401	GENERAL	They shall not hurt you
L309204	u6029	m401	CATHY	Shh??? it's all right -? I'll be all right.
L309203	u6031	m401	GENERAL	In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then ?- I'll not die ?? I'll watch -? they shall not hurt you.
L309202	u6029	m401	CATHY	It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
L309163	u6029	m401	CATHY	No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
L309162	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
L309160	u6029	m401	CATHY	How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
L309159	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill ?? or frightened.
L309158	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I was looking for you.
L309157	u6029	m401	CATHY	What are you doing?
L309105	u6031	m401	GENERAL	How old is she?
L309104	u6029	m401	CATHY	She has never mentioned her family.
L309103	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
L309102	u6029	m401	CATHY	Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
L309101	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
L309099	u6029	m401	CATHY	I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
L309098	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
L309222	u6029	m401	CATHY	We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
L309221	u6035	m401	THEA	It was, the plague
L309220	u6029	m401	CATHY	Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
L309219	u6035	m401	THEA	She is dead ? at peace.
L309218	u6029	m401	CATHY	When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
L309217	u6035	m401	THEA	You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
L308927	u6035	m401	THEA	I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
L308926	u6029	m401	CATHY	That should decide it or you --
L308925	u6035	m401	THEA	I felt he did not like me.
L308923	u6035	m401	THEA	I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now ?- I don't know ??
L308922	u6029	m401	CATHY	Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
L308921	u6029	m401	CATHY	The General ? you don't even know him.
L308920	u6035	m401	THEA	But one must love a father.
L308919	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
L308907	u6035	m401	THEA	My last name is Pherides.
L308906	u6029	m401	CATHY	I have forgotten it, dear.
L308905	u6035	m401	THEA	You have forgotten my last name?
L308904	u6029	m401	CATHY	What is it -- what are you talking about?
L308903	u6035	m401	THEA	I do not know him, but I have seen him.
L308902	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
L308901	u6029	m401	CATHY	Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
L308900	u6035	m401	THEA	I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -?or just because he is one's father?
L308899	u6029	m401	CATHY	What an odd question!
L308898	u6035	m401	THEA	Cathy ?- how does it feel to have a father?
L308864	u6029	m401	CATHY	Thea is an orphan.
L308863	u6035	m401	THEA	You are fortunate in your father.
L308842	u6035	m401	THEA	And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
L308841	u6029	m401	CATHY	The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer ?? a correspondent of some sort ??
L309173	u6029	m401	CATHY	Wouldn't I?
L309172	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You wouldn't tell that ??
L309171	u6029	m401	CATHY	When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people ?- a cataleptic!
L309169	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
L309168	u6029	m401	CATHY	Really, this is idiotic!
L309167	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man ? ? working at him ? ? turning him against Thea.
L309166	u6029	m401	CATHY	Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
L309165	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours ?? but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
L309030	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	That your father and I ??
L309029	u6029	m401	CATHY	You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
L309028	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you ?- I'll warn them against you.
L309027	u6029	m401	CATHY	Why, I'm fond of Thea.
L309026	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints ?? the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
L309025	u6029	m401	CATHY	What if he is?
L309024	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ??young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
L309023	u6029	m401	CATHY	What would I be thinking?
L309022	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
L309021	u6029	m401	CATHY	You were father's secretary -? I never thought - -
L309020	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ??you've ruined mine ??
L309019	u6029	m401	CATHY	How do you know what my father thought - -
L309018	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
L309017	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed ? everytime you can't get your own way.
L309016	u6029	m401	CATHY	Miss Wollsten!
L309015	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are ?? a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
L309014	u6029	m401	CATHY	Whet do you mean?
L309013	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
L309155	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
L309154	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live ?- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
L309153	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
L309152	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
L309151	u6031	m401	GENERAL	If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
L309150	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure ?- quite sure.
L309149	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I don't understand you.
L309148	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep ?- I want to avoid it.
L309147	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Yes?
L309146	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
L309144	u6031	m401	GENERAL	He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
L309143	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
L309142	u6031	m401	GENERAL	He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
L309141	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in ?- entombed ?? imprisoned..
L309140	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Woman, what are you doing here?
L308981	u6031	m401	GENERAL	This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
L308980	u6032	m401	MISS WOLLSTEN	No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
L308860	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I will go with you.
L308859	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	This girl -- Thea ?- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
L308858	u6031	m401	GENERAL	This girl --
L308856	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Why -- no not before Thea came ??
L308855	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
L308854	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
L308853	u6031	m401	GENERAL	What is her illness?
L308852	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	She's not too well.
L308851	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Your daughter is ill.
L308850	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Miss Wollsten -? my secretary, she'd know.
L308849	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
L308847	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
L308846	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Her family name?
L308845	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	Theodosia.
L308844	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Her name is Thea?
L308843	u6034	m401	ST. AUBYN	I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice?Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
L309239	u6033	m401	OLIVER	She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
L309238	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Daughter -- my daughter --
L309237	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
L309236	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Theodosia --
L309199	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I shall not leave the island ??
L309198	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Come ?- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
L309197	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I have had command for the last time ?-
L309055	u6033	m401	OLIVER	When you make sense I'll listen.
L309054	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Listen to what I say --
L309053	u6033	m401	OLIVER	That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle ?-
L309052	u6031	m401	GENERAL	If I told you ?? you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you ?? the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -?
L309051	u6033	m401	OLIVER	And I'm your friend ?? but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
L309050	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You are my friend.
L309049	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I had a notion you had become self?appointed chaperone lately ? why?
L309048	u6031	m401	GENERAL	In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
L309047	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
L309046	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ??pale -- sick -- she died --
L309045	u6033	m401	OLIVER	How did she die?
L309044	u6031	m401	GENERAL	She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
L309043	u6033	m401	OLIVER	If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
L309042	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Thea is so like her ?? in every feature ??
L308972	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
L308971	u6033	m401	OLIVER	We still don't know that it's the plague ??
L308970	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Better no general than one carrying the plague.
L308969	u6033	m401	OLIVER	But the war, the army ?? they need you.
L308968	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
L308941	u6031	m401	GENERAL	The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
L308940	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
L308939	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I've seen men die drunk ?- and I've seen men die of the plague.
L308929	u6031	m401	GENERAL	We have no time for that.
L308928	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
L308918	u6031	m401	GENERAL	It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
L308917	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I can't understand that.
L308916	u6031	m401	GENERAL	It makes me fear her.
L308915	u6033	m401	OLIVER	But that should make you like her.
L308914	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I know all you are going to say ?-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -?there is something about her ??the way she moves ?? the way she turns her head.
L308913	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Oh, now ?? now look here ??
L308912	u6031	m401	GENERAL	There is something evil about her.
L308911	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Thea?
L308910	u6031	m401	GENERAL	I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ??
L308909	u6033	m401	OLIVER	It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
L308908	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in ?- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me ?? a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
L308792	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Maybe you've got the wrong crypt ?? after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
L308791	u6031	m401	GENERAL	She is not there. The coffin is gone.
L308787	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
L308786	u6031	m401	GENERAL	There's no one there -? nothing but the caves and the dead.
L308785	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Do you mind if I go with you?
L308783	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You were at those battles as a spectator ? ? I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me ?? those men out there ?? dead or dying ?? by my order -- because I willed it so.
L308782	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
L308781	u6031	m401	GENERAL	You know that sound, Oliver?
L308779	u6033	m401	OLIVER	In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
L308778	u6031	m401	GENERAL	Hero?
L308777	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
L309138	u6035	m401	THEA	No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it ?- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
L309137	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -?
L309136	u6035	m401	THEA	For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
L309135	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
L309133	u6035	m401	THEA	Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
L309132	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
L309131	u6035	m401	THEA	It is for that he hates me.
L309130	u6033	m401	OLIVER	"Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? ""He stole your mother"" ?-"
L309129	u6035	m401	THEA	It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
L309128	u6033	m401	OLIVER	I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
L309127	u6035	m401	THEA	He hates all my race.
L309126	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Why in the world can't you?
L309125	u6035	m401	THEA	I can't.
L309124	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Well, tell, him.
L309123	u6035	m401	THEA	He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
L309122	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble ?? the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
L309121	u6035	m401	THEA	The General threatened me.
L309120	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Thea, what's wrong?
L309072	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You see? Thea believes it, too!
L309071	u6035	m401	THEA	Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
L309038	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
L309037	u6035	m401	THEA	Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
L309036	u6033	m401	OLIVER	What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
L309035	u6033	m401	OLIVER	Everything's so simple. I like you.
L309034	u6035	m401	THEA	I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
L309033	u6033	m401	OLIVER	You're crying. Why?
L326446	u6120	m407	AMANDA	We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
L326445	u6121	m407	BERLIN	How about any guys on your staff?
L326444	u6120	m407	AMANDA	Only me and Mom ..
L326443	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
L326442	u6120	m407	AMANDA	No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
L326441	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Is it your vehicle?
L326440	u6120	m407	AMANDA	The van?
L326439	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"I'm afraid it's the ""van"" again."
L326438	u6120	m407	AMANDA	As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
L326274	u6121	m407	BERLIN	That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
L326273	u6127	m407	ROSS	You ain't going in alone?
L326272	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
L326271	u6121	m407	BERLIN	We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
L326270	u6127	m407	ROSS	What if we need a back up?
L326269	u6121	m407	BERLIN	<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
L326268	u6127	m407	ROSS	Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
L326267	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"What d'you mean, ""bits."""
L326266	u6127	m407	ROSS	Bits.
L326265	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
L326264	u6127	m407	ROSS	It's twenty of three.
L326263	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I guess by the bed.
L326262	u6127	m407	ROSS	Where's your watch?
L326261	u6127	m407	ROSS	Hey ..
L326260	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Listen, you don't havta come?
L326258	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"This ""cop"" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas."
L326257	u6127	m407	ROSS	Now?
L326256	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I'm going up to the institute.
L326255	u6127	m407	ROSS	What exactly you doing, John?
L326253	u6127	m407	ROSS	I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
L326252	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Jesus. What are you doin?
L326235	u6121	m407	BERLIN	That's just what I wanna find out.
L326234	u6127	m407	ROSS	Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
L326233	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You got a quiet phone somewhere?
L326228	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Are you sure you didn't call?
L326227	u6127	m407	ROSS	Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
L326209	u6127	m407	ROSS	Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
L326208	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
L326198	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
L326197	u6127	m407	ROSS	What about Citrine?
L326196	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
L326195	u6127	m407	ROSS	I dunno what I can do to help you?
L326194	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
L326193	u6127	m407	ROSS	Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
L326192	u6121	m407	BERLIN	<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
L326191	u6127	m407	ROSS	Ease off, John ..
L326190	u6121	m407	BERLIN	How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
L326189	u6127	m407	ROSS	I'm asking it.
L326188	u6121	m407	BERLIN	That's a very stupid question, Ross.
L326186	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No .. You didn't know that ..
L326185	u6127	m407	ROSS	Well .. I didn't know that ..
L326184	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the ""committee?"""
L326183	u6127	m407	ROSS	You don't really believe this?
L326182	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
L326181	u6127	m407	ROSS	"I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? ""Good-bye, Princess,"" & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?"
L326180	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
L326141	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my ""Nervous Tick"" ..."
L326140	u6127	m407	ROSS	You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
L326139	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Sure.
L326138	u6127	m407	ROSS	Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
L326137	u6121	m407	BERLIN	She wasn't lying about the van.
L326136	u6127	m407	ROSS	You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
L326135	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Just makes to so God damned mad ..
L326134	u6127	m407	ROSS	You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
L326133	u6127	m407	ROSS	John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
L326132	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
L326131	u6127	m407	ROSS	Stop it.
L326120	u6127	m407	ROSS	No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
L326119	u6121	m407	BERLIN	God, it pisses me off, Ross.
L326086	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Car accident.
L326085	u6127	m407	ROSS	Why's she blind, Bro?
L326054	u6121	m407	BERLIN	He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
L326053	u6127	m407	ROSS	No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
L326052	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You looked like you did?
L326051	u6127	m407	ROSS	Did I say he did?
L326050	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
L326049	u6127	m407	ROSS	I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
L326048	u6121	m407	BERLIN	All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
L326047	u6127	m407	ROSS	Did he shut you down?
L325988	u6127	m407	ROSS	What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
L325987	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You believe me, don't you?
L325985	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I was wrong.
L325984	u6127	m407	ROSS	That isn't what you said before.
L325983	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is ""Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."""
L325982	u6127	m407	ROSS	For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
L325981	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
L325980	u6127	m407	ROSS	Listen to me saying what?
L325979	u6121	m407	BERLIN	That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
L325978	u6127	m407	ROSS	Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
L325977	u6121	m407	BERLIN	They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
L325976	u6127	m407	ROSS	"How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over ""Jennifer"" for months?"
L325975	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
L325969	u6127	m407	ROSS	You want me to stop the car?
L325968	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
L325967	u6127	m407	ROSS	It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
L325966	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
L325965	u6127	m407	ROSS	To throw out of the window.
L325964	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What do you want it for?
L325963	u6127	m407	ROSS	"I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called ""cash."""
L325962	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
L325961	u6127	m407	ROSS	I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
L325960	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Why?
L325959	u6127	m407	ROSS	Then give me that Zippo.
L325958	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I haven't got it.
L325957	u6127	m407	ROSS	Pay me, and I shut up.
L325956	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
L325955	u6127	m407	ROSS	So am I. But where's my money?
L325954	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
L325953	u6127	m407	ROSS	Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
L325952	u6121	m407	BERLIN	We're going.
L325951	u6127	m407	ROSS	No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
L325950	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
L325949	u6127	m407	ROSS	No, you didn't.
L325948	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
L325926	u6127	m407	ROSS	<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
L325925	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
L325924	u6127	m407	ROSS	Thank Christ we got a witness.
L325923	u6121	m407	BERLIN	This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
L325911	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
L325910	u6127	m407	ROSS	Where is everyone?
L325894	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
L325893	u6127	m407	ROSS	Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
L325890	u6127	m407	ROSS	No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
L325889	u6121	m407	BERLIN	O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
L325888	u6127	m407	ROSS	Because I dislike her too much ..
L325887	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"Why don't you dump the ""Fat Lady?"""
L325886	u6127	m407	ROSS	Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
L325885	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What do you mean, Ross?
L325884	u6127	m407	ROSS	Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
L325883	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What do you mean?
L325852	u6121	m407	BERLIN	A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
L325851	u6127	m407	ROSS	Someone bet me a dollar ..
L325850	u6121	m407	BERLIN	How'd you do it, old man?
L325849	u6127	m407	ROSS	"I don't mean this ""system"" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can .."
L325848	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
L325847	u6127	m407	ROSS	You gotta stop smoking ..
L325843	u6127	m407	ROSS	"Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that ""bye-bye."" Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief .."
L325842	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Maybe?
L325841	u6127	m407	ROSS	You want my advice?
L325840	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
L325839	u6127	m407	ROSS	Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
L325838	u6121	m407	BERLIN	It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
L325836	u6121	m407	BERLIN	It's a method for quitting smoking.
L325835	u6127	m407	ROSS	He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
L325834	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I already did. What's his problem?
L325833	u6127	m407	ROSS	"It's an ""unsolved."" They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case."
L325831	u6127	m407	ROSS	Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
L325830	u6121	m407	BERLIN	There's nothing in the files?
L325829	u6127	m407	ROSS	Because, don't get into it ...
L325828	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"Why so coy about the word ""frozen""?"
L325827	u6127	m407	ROSS	"Seven thirty-five .. Here, ""Town Gets Top Cop."" I was gonna pin it to your wall."
L325826	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What time is it?
L325816	u6127	m407	ROSS	"C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is ""God's Country,"" John."
L325815	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Not too good in daylight ..
L325814	u6127	m407	ROSS	What does that mean?
L325813	u6121	m407	BERLIN	O.K.
L325812	u6127	m407	ROSS	How's the new residence?
L325810	u6127	m407	ROSS	Since when did you drink diet soda?
L325809	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
L325806	u6127	m407	ROSS	What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
L325805	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Not for me ..
L325802	u6127	m407	ROSS	A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
L325801	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Who is who?
L325762	u6127	m407	ROSS	Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
L325761	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Yeah, he can go ...
L325755	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
L325754	u6127	m407	ROSS	The <u>dogs</u>?
L325753	u6121	m407	BERLIN	We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
L325751	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I think you're here all day.
L325750	u6127	m407	ROSS	What do you think?
L325745	u6127	m407	ROSS	Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
L325744	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What about that kid, Ross?
L325743	u6127	m407	ROSS	Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
L325742	u6121	m407	BERLIN	So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
L325731	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
L325730	u6127	m407	ROSS	Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
L325727	u6127	m407	ROSS	Welcome to Eureka.
L325726	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a ""tourist."""
L325725	u6127	m407	ROSS	You heard. Look for the knife.
L325724	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
L325717	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
L325716	u6127	m407	ROSS	Be my guest. What you got?
L325715	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I hope I'm not intruding?
L325714	u6127	m407	ROSS	Did you bring it with you?
L326462	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
L326461	u6123	m407	CITRINE	You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
L326460	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
L326312	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
L326311	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
L326310	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
L326117	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No.
L326116	u6123	m407	CITRINE	And did they?
L326115	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"I never asked if he could ""see."" I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?"
L326114	u6123	m407	CITRINE	"He says, you freaked one of em out?  ""Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous"" .."
L326113	u6121	m407	BERLIN	That's bullshit,
L326112	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
L326111	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Once.
L326110	u6123	m407	CITRINE	I'm talking, outside the girl?
L326109	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Three or four.
L326108	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
L326107	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
L326106	u6123	m407	CITRINE	"I'm shutting you down on this ""blind thing,"" John."
L326046	u6123	m407	CITRINE	We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
L326045	u6121	m407	BERLIN	We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
L326044	u6123	m407	CITRINE	I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
L326043	u6121	m407	BERLIN	If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
L326042	u6123	m407	CITRINE	"She's <u>not</u> ""missing."" Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John."
L326041	u6121	m407	BERLIN	It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
L326040	u6123	m407	CITRINE	It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
L326039	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No, Sir.
L326038	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Have you got a print from the hand?
L326037	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No.
L326036	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Have you got a match on the bullet?
L326035	u6121	m407	BERLIN	He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
L326034	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
L326033	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
L326032	u6123	m407	CITRINE	You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
L325877	u6123	m407	CITRINE	I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
L325876	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What do you want me to do, Chief?
L325875	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
L325874	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I thought it was Taylor's case?
L325873	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
L325869	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
L325868	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
L325867	u6123	m407	CITRINE	I don't see that at all ..
L325866	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think ""Jennifer,"" and this lady got hit by the same guy?"
L325865	u6123	m407	CITRINE	What is all this Jennifer stuff?
L325864	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
L325863	u6123	m407	CITRINE	How do you know her hair's black?
L325862	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
L325861	u6123	m407	CITRINE	What is that?
L325788	u6123	m407	CITRINE	That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
L325787	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Why did he ask if it was frozen?
L325778	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Maybe he's lying to you?
L325777	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Kid told me he didn't take it?
L325776	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No .. But we have a theory ..
L325775	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
L325772	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
L325771	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
L325770	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Did he get you the job?
L325767	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
L325766	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Is this normal?
L325741	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
L325740	u6121	m407	BERLIN	My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
L325739	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
L325733	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
L325732	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	What does that mean, Sergeant?
L325729	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
L325728	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
L326425	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
L326424	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	I've heard you call him Freddy.
L326423	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross ""Freddy"" in my life .."
L326413	u6121	m407	BERLIN	He ain't offerin me shit.
L326412	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
L326178	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
L326177	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"I know what a ""witness"" is."
L326176	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
L326175	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You don't know what you done, Taylor.
L326169	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
L326168	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
L326167	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
L326166	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	Bullshit.
L326165	u6121	m407	BERLIN	So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
L326164	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
L326163	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
L326162	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
L326161	u6121	m407	BERLIN	<u>You</u> put it in there.
L326160	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	"His blind friend got ""attacked."" Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper."
L326145	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	Wrong cabinet.
L326144	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Vehicle references.
L326143	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	What are you looking for?
L326142	u6121	m407	BERLIN	.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
L326130	u6121	m407	BERLIN	How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
L326129	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
L325909	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
L325908	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
L325907	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
L325906	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Yes, Sir.
L325899	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
L325898	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
L325897	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
L325896	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
L325895	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
L326421	u6121	m407	BERLIN	It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
L326420	u6125	m407	HELENA	I don't want them to arrest you.
L326419	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I think they're gonna arrest me.
L326418	u6125	m407	HELENA	I wanna be near you ...
L326417	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
L326408	u6125	m407	HELENA	I'm blind because my father drank.
L326407	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You do?
L326406	u6125	m407	HELENA	I know about alcohol, John.
L326405	u6121	m407	BERLIN	He doesn't need my help.
L326397	u6125	m407	HELENA	Then why didn't he kill me?
L326396	u6121	m407	BERLIN	He don't know that. I didn't.
L326395	u6125	m407	HELENA	I can't identify him ..
L326394	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Coz he thinks you're a witness.
L326393	u6125	m407	HELENA	Why does he want to kill me?
L326392	u6121	m407	BERLIN	The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
L326391	u6125	m407	HELENA	<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
L326390	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
L326389	u6125	m407	HELENA	Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
L326294	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No .. not now ..
L326293	u6125	m407	HELENA	I'm going back to the institute.
L326292	u6121	m407	BERLIN	She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
L326287	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
L326286	u6125	m407	HELENA	Why?
L326285	u6121	m407	BERLIN	It's not possible right now.
L326284	u6125	m407	HELENA	Why can't I stay with you?
L326205	u6125	m407	HELENA	Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
L326204	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"You're looking more worried now than when you ""decided to stop worrying""?"
L326203	u6125	m407	HELENA	No I'm not.
L326202	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You're looking worried again, Helena?
L326201	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
L326200	u6125	m407	HELENA	I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
L326199	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Has he got your aunt's address?
L326150	u6125	m407	HELENA	Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
L326149	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You know? How do you know?
L326148	u6125	m407	HELENA	I know.
L326147	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I have to talk to you, Helena.
L326102	u6125	m407	HELENA	Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
L326101	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Which is what?
L326100	u6125	m407	HELENA	Just your age.
L326099	u6121	m407	BERLIN	He said that? What else did he say?
L326098	u6125	m407	HELENA	He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
L326097	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Really? What did he say?
L326096	u6125	m407	HELENA	Ross told me.
L326095	u6121	m407	BERLIN	How d'you know what I'm like?
L326094	u6125	m407	HELENA	I know what you're like ..
L326093	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I was married to her sister ..
L326092	u6125	m407	HELENA	Have you known her long?
L326091	u6121	m407	BERLIN	She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
L326027	u6121	m407	BERLIN	.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
L326026	u6125	m407	HELENA	Sorry?
L326024	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
L326023	u6125	m407	HELENA	You said, you were in the bad lands?
L326022	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Pray?
L326021	u6125	m407	HELENA	Do you pray?
L326020	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
L326019	u6125	m407	HELENA	No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
L326018	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"Yeah, that'll do .. Is that ""Hamlet?"""
L326017	u6125	m407	HELENA	Thoughts that lie too deep for tears.
L326016	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
L326015	u6125	m407	HELENA	You just asked me to ask you questions.
L326014	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
L326013	u6125	m407	HELENA	Are you married?
L326012	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"There's no one ""looking at you"" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me."
L326011	u6125	m407	HELENA	I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
L326010	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
L326009	u6125	m407	HELENA	Oh.
L326008	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No.
L326007	u6125	m407	HELENA	Are you wearing a uniform?
L326005	u6125	m407	HELENA	You should. It's wonderful.
L326004	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No.
L326003	u6125	m407	HELENA	Hamlet. Have you read it?
L326002	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What are you reading?
L326001	u6125	m407	HELENA	It was probably the wind.
L326000	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
L325998	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Of course I would ..
L325997	u6125	m407	HELENA	If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
L325996	u6125	m407	HELENA	"Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded ""hollow"" .."
L325995	u6121	m407	BERLIN	"I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a ""hollow car?"""
L325994	u6125	m407	HELENA	I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
L325992	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
L325991	u6125	m407	HELENA	I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
L325990	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
L325989	u6125	m407	HELENA	Have you been here long?
L325944	u6125	m407	HELENA	I don't know.
L325943	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What color was it?
L325942	u6125	m407	HELENA	Yes.
L325941	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Did Amber have a dog?
L325939	u6125	m407	HELENA	Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
L325938	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
L325937	u6125	m407	HELENA	No.
L325936	u6121	m407	BERLIN	D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
L325935	u6125	m407	HELENA	Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
L325934	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Me?
L325933	u6125	m407	HELENA	No. Except he smoked. Like you.
L325932	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
L325931	u6125	m407	HELENA	My hands?
L325930	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Can I see your hands?
L325929	u6125	m407	HELENA	No, it has a mind of its own.
L325928	u6121	m407	BERLIN	The elevator wasn't working?
L325922	u6125	m407	HELENA	I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
L325921	u6121	m407	BERLIN	John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
L325920	u6125	m407	HELENA	Why not? You heard my voice?
L325919	u6121	m407	BERLIN	No.
L325918	u6125	m407	HELENA	When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
L325917	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You must have some idea about him.
L325915	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
L325914	u6125	m407	HELENA	Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
L325913	u6121	m407	BERLIN	I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
L325912	u6125	m407	HELENA	What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
L326308	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	The man from the F.B.I.
L326307	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Who sought the warrant?
L326306	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	Yes, Sir.
L326305	u6121	m407	BERLIN	You got a warrant for this?
L326304	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
L326303	u6121	m407	BERLIN	Why?
L326302	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	I been told to take your car in, Sir.
L326301	u6121	m407	BERLIN	What are you doing, Travis?
L325786	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
L325785	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
L325784	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
L325783	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	Grateful for your candor, Sir.
L325782	u6123	m407	CITRINE	.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
L325781	u6122	m407	BLATTIS	C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
L325780	u6123	m407	CITRINE	Interview over, Blattis ...
L325905	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
L325904	u6127	m407	ROSS	And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
L325903	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	"Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't ""blind"" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left .."
L325902	u6127	m407	ROSS	Yeah, I guess I do.
L325901	u6124	m407	GOODRIDGE	You find something curious in that?
L325900	u6127	m407	ROSS	A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
L326289	u6126	m407	MARGIE	I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
L326288	u6125	m407	HELENA	Is that Margie?
L326237	u6125	m407	HELENA	Don't mix very well with beer.
L326236	u6126	m407	MARGIE	How you doing on those shoes?
L326222	u6126	m407	MARGIE	I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
L326221	u6125	m407	HELENA	You think John would like it?
L326220	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
L326219	u6125	m407	HELENA	I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
L326218	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
L326217	u6125	m407	HELENA	You think he still loves her?
L326216	u6126	m407	MARGIE	You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
L326215	u6125	m407	HELENA	What does that mean?
L326214	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
L326213	u6125	m407	HELENA	What was she like?
L326212	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Two or three years ago.
L326211	u6125	m407	HELENA	When did John divorce?
L326083	u6127	m407	ROSS	Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
L326082	u6126	m407	MARGIE	He's not that bad of a guy ..?
L326081	u6127	m407	ROSS	She married some English prick.
L326077	u6127	m407	ROSS	I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
L326076	u6126	m407	MARGIE	You want something, darling?
L326075	u6127	m407	ROSS	Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
L326074	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
L326073	u6127	m407	ROSS	"I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the ""element"" is a bad idea."
L326072	u6126	m407	MARGIE	He's happy, darlin ..
L326071	u6127	m407	ROSS	She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
L326070	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
L325808	u6127	m407	ROSS	Even better.
L325807	u6126	m407	MARGIE	No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
L325804	u6127	m407	ROSS	Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
L325803	u6126	m407	MARGIE	So tonight she confesses?
L325800	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Freddy's new obsession ..
L325799	u6127	m407	ROSS	Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
L325798	u6126	m407	MARGIE	Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
L325797	u6127	m407	ROSS	Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
L325796	u6126	m407	MARGIE	I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
L326174	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
L326173	u6127	m407	ROSS	Shut up, King Jay ..
L326172	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	"He tells her, ""bye-bye,"" and she gets ""attacked."" Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no ""Ser- ial Killer."" Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>."
L326171	u6127	m407	ROSS	Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
L326170	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
L326159	u6127	m407	ROSS	Whass going on here?
L326158	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
L326127	u6128	m407	TAYLOR	No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
L326126	u6127	m407	ROSS	"Hey, we're not talking ""talk"" tonight."
L325760	u6127	m407	ROSS	Ask him.
L325759	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
L325748	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	I think I've found a hand.
L325747	u6127	m407	ROSS	"Whatta you mean, ""horrible?"""
L325746	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
L325722	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	No, Sir.
L325721	u6127	m407	ROSS	Don't annoy me, Travis.
L325720	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
L325711	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
L325710	u6127	m407	ROSS	Where do you fit in, Trimble?
L325706	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	A derelict.
L325705	u6127	m407	ROSS	Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
L325704	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
L325703	u6127	m407	ROSS	He has? .. What's he doing here?
L325702	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
L325701	u6127	m407	ROSS	I'm already walking. Where is it?
L325700	u6129	m407	TRAVIS	You can drive down there, Sir ..
L333033	u6182	m413	ANNA	Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
L333032	u6190	m413	KAFKA	A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
L333031	u6182	m413	ANNA	What is it really?
L333030	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
L333028	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Up there.
L333027	u6182	m413	ANNA	Where do you live?
L333001	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You have been hearing the sordid side then.
L333000	u6182	m413	ANNA	You work in the insurance department?
L332992	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
L332991	u6182	m413	ANNA	-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
L333215	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What was the matter with it?
L333214	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	Fine -- terrible.
L333125	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
L333124	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Have you worked here long?
L333123	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	Yes -- we do.
L333122	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You look like brothers.
L333118	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	Yes -- that's us.
L333117	u6190	m413	KAFKA	My assistants, I presume.
L333305	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
L333304	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
L333302	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	-- Small.
L333301	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
L333201	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
L333200	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Merely in the interests of order.
L333183	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
L333182	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
L333167	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
L333166	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
L333440	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
L333439	u6190	m413	KAFKA	A true friend would do it.
L333438	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Then its authority is in doubt.
L333437	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's my last and final one.
L333436	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	What an extraordinary request!
L333435	u6190	m413	KAFKA	If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
L333434	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Another one?
L333433	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Will you do me a favor then?
L333432	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Yes.
L333431	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You appreciate my writing.
L333430	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
L333429	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
L333428	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
L333427	u6190	m413	KAFKA	An empty tomb?
L333426	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
L333425	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	In a manner of speaking.
L333424	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
L333423	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
L333422	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
L333421	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
L333420	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
L333419	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
L333418	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
L333415	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
L333414	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	A man must eat --  And drink.
L333413	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You work in the cemetery.
L333296	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
L333295	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Success or nothing?
L333294	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
L333293	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
L333292	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
L333291	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
L333290	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
L333289	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
L333287	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	-- In what sense?
L333286	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
L333044	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
L333043	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Did you?
L333042	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	I read the one about the penal colony.
L333041	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- In magazines nobody reads.
L333040	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Just what you've published.
L333039	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I don't know what you could have read.
L333038	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
L333233	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.
L333232	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
L332959	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'll commit that to memory.
L332958	u6186	m413	BURGEL	When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
L332957	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
L332956	u6186	m413	BURGEL	But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
L332955	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
L332954	u6186	m413	BURGEL	In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
L332953	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
L332952	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
L332951	u6186	m413	BURGEL	He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
L332950	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
L332949	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Did you see him?
L332948	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, I left it in his office.
L332947	u6186	m413	BURGEL	You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
L332946	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I gave it to him yesterday.
L332945	u6186	m413	BURGEL	The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
L333116	u6186	m413	BURGEL	And you're late!
L333115	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You're detestable.
L333114	u6186	m413	BURGEL	It's what I'm paid to do.
L333113	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You're just doing your job.
L333112	u6186	m413	BURGEL	It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
L333111	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
L333110	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
L333109	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
L333108	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
L333345	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
L333344	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
L333343	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
L333342	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
L333341	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
L333340	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Was there something else?
L333338	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
L333337	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	I do.
L333336	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
L333107	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
L333106	u6190	m413	KAFKA	In a small way.
L333105	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	I understand you fancy yourself an author.
L333101	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
L333100	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Eduard --
L333099	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
L333098	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Well, I --
L333097	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
L333096	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, sir.
L333095	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
L333094	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I did not realize it was obligatory.
L333093	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
L333092	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I usually take lunch by the River.
L333091	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
L333090	u6190	m413	KAFKA	To do my work well, I have little time for --
L333089	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
L333088	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... My ... social situation?
L333087	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
L333086	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Sit down, Kafka.
L333085	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You wanted to see me, sir.
L333516	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
L333515	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Listen to me --
L333514	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
L333513	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No -- not this time.
L333512	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
L333511	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
L333510	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
L333509	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
L333508	u6190	m413	KAFKA	There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
L333507	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
L333506	u6190	m413	KAFKA	They're dead now.  We can get help.
L333505	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
L333504	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I -- I found your jailer.
L333503	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
L333501	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
L333500	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Gabriela ...?
L333499	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
L333498	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
L333497	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
L333496	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Gabriela! -- you did get away.
L333262	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
L333261	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
L333260	u6190	m413	KAFKA	First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
L333259	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
L333258	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Usually.
L333257	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
L333256	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've heard of it happening.
L333255	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
L333254	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
L333253	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
L333252	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
L333251	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
L333250	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Burgel doesn't like anybody!
L333249	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
L333248	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
L333247	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
L333246	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
L333245	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
L333242	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I wouldn't put it past him.
L333241	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You don't believe that.
L333240	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
L333239	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
L333238	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	They're not obliged to tell.
L333237	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Why were you given notice?
L333236	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
L333235	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
L333234	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
L333209	u6190	m413	KAFKA	At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
L333208	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	"Yes -- which is why ""quiet, dependable people"" have to take charge of their own lives."
L333207	u6190	m413	KAFKA	My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
L333206	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
L333197	u6190	m413	KAFKA	People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
L333196	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
L333195	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
L333194	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
L333190	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He was murdered.
L333189	u6190	m413	KAFKA	And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
L333186	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
L333185	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What of it?
L333184	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
L333177	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
L333176	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
L333175	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
L333169	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
L333168	u6190	m413	KAFKA	"Ah -- we're back to the ""authorities"" you spoke of."
L333161	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You won't have any trouble finding it.
L333160	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- I don't know the Musil district.
L333159	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
L333158	u6190	m413	KAFKA	And you ...?
L333157	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Eduard wanted to marry me.
L333156	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
L333155	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You almost married recently, didn't you?
L333154	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... All right.
L333153	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
L333152	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Tonight?
L333151	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Are you free tonight?
L333150	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- What could he have done to warrant that?
L333149	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
L333148	u6190	m413	KAFKA	When I have no reason to doubt.
L333147	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
L333146	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
L333145	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
L333144	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
L333143	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
L333142	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
L333140	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
L333139	u6190	m413	KAFKA	How long were you and Eduard --
L333138	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
L333137	u6190	m413	KAFKA	This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
L333136	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	What's funny?
L333135	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
L333134	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
L333133	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	What?
L333132	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I suspected that he -- well.
L333131	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
L333130	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No.
L333129	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
L333023	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Yes.
L333022	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
L333021	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Have you looked?
L333020	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've never seen you here before.
L333019	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Hello again.
L332980	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
L332979	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
L332978	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	One of you must be mistaken.
L332977	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
L332976	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Why would you suppose so?
L332975	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
L332974	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know.
L332973	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
L333280	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
L333279	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	What did she say?
L333278	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Maybe it's true then what she said.
L333276	u6190	m413	KAFKA	She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
L333275	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
L333274	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
L333272	u6190	m413	KAFKA	If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
L333271	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
L333270	u6190	m413	KAFKA	But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
L333084	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
L333083	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'll bear that in mind.
L333082	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
L333081	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Probably not.
L333079	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... Just a perception.
L333078	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	What makes you think so?
L333077	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He wasn't a lonely man, though.
L333076	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	We know that.
L333075	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
L333074	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
L333073	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Can I ask -- how you found me?
L333072	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
L333071	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, I suppose not.
L333070	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
L333069	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
L333068	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Was he depressed?
L333067	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I don't know.
L333066	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
L333065	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
L333064	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
L333063	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Well -- other departments are, yes.
L333062	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
L333061	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Eight -- and seven months.
L333060	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Where you've been employed for seven years.
L333059	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Accident and Compensation Association.
L333058	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Your office is the Workmen's --
L333057	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
L333056	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
L333055	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Wednesday.  We left the office together.
L333054	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
L333053	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
L333052	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Kafka -- is that your real name?
L333407	u6194	m413	OSKAR	It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
L333406	u6190	m413	KAFKA	My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
L333405	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Close only by virtue of antithesis.
L333404	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
L333401	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's a farce.
L333400	u6194	m413	OSKAR	-- Just doing our job.
L333399	u6190	m413	KAFKA	For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
L333380	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You should meet my father.
L333379	u6194	m413	OSKAR	I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
L333378	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What's the matter with you?
L333373	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You mean you've actually begun some?
L333372	u6194	m413	OSKAR	-- I was just trying to finish some work!
L333224	u6194	m413	OSKAR	You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
L333223	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
L333220	u6194	m413	OSKAR	We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
L333219	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Do you?
L333320	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
L333319	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
L333318	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
L333315	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Then why haven't I been --
L333314	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
L333311	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
L333310	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
L333309	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
L333308	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That's <u>mad</u>.
L333174	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
L333173	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... Why take me into your confidence?
L333487	u6193	m413	MURNAU	As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
L333486	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
L333485	u6193	m413	MURNAU	-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
L333482	u6193	m413	MURNAU	On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
L333481	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
L333478	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Lying in the gutter where they belong.
L333477	u6193	m413	MURNAU	May I ask where your two warders are?
L333475	u6193	m413	MURNAU	Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
L333474	u6190	m413	KAFKA	And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
L333472	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
L333471	u6193	m413	MURNAU	I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
L333470	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Accident and Compensation -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
L333469	u6193	m413	MURNAU	-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
L333467	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
L333466	u6193	m413	MURNAU	-- You seem amused.
L333465	u6193	m413	MURNAU	You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
L333464	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... A piece of paper ...
L333463	u6193	m413	MURNAU	Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
L333462	u6193	m413	MURNAU	A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
L333461	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... A piece of paper ...
L333370	u6191	m413	KEEPER	It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
L333369	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I could always apply there.
L333368	u6191	m413	KEEPER	We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
L333367	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Where do our records go to in the Castle?
L333366	u6191	m413	KEEPER	You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
L333365	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
L333364	u6191	m413	KEEPER	These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
L333363	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
L333362	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
L333361	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
L333360	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
L333359	u6190	m413	KAFKA	This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
L333358	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
L333357	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
L333356	u6191	m413	KEEPER	You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
L333355	u6190	m413	KAFKA	All these in the last year?
L333352	u6191	m413	KEEPER	It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
L333351	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Orlac is an account?
L333350	u6191	m413	KEEPER	If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
L333335	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You mean my Chief has it.
L333334	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
L333333	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's gone out so quickly?
L333332	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
L333331	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What's the matter?
L333330	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
L333329	u6191	m413	KEEPER	"Wait a minute.  ""Raban?""  Where have I heard that name?"
L333328	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.  Isn't it there?
L333327	u6191	m413	KEEPER	"I'm overworked as it is.  ""Raban"" did you say?"
L333326	u6191	m413	KEEPER	I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
L333325	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It usually is.
L333324	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Raban -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
L333530	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Amerika!
L333529	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Amerika for us!
L333528	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Then that's the place for us!
L333525	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	What's to become of us now?
L333524	u6194	m413	OSKAR	It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
L333523	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	I understand he was wounded in the lung.
L333522	u6194	m413	OSKAR	They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
L333521	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
L333495	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
L333494	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	This is filed incorrectly!
L333493	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Ludwig?
L333492	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Oskar!
L333411	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
L333410	u6194	m413	OSKAR	But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
L333382	u6194	m413	OSKAR	-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
L333381	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
L333377	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	And we're upset too.
L333376	u6194	m413	OSKAR	It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
L333227	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	It's not too bad working here.
L333226	u6194	m413	OSKAR	We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
L333225	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
L333222	u6194	m413	OSKAR	She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
L333221	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Women are all you have on your mind!
L333218	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
L333217	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	You look tired.
L333216	u6194	m413	OSKAR	He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
L333121	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Oskar.
L333120	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Ludwig.
L335900	u6204	m415	BREE	Did he come around often?
L335899	u6203	m415	ARLYN	What about him? Yes.
L335898	u6204	m415	BREE	Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
L335897	u6203	m415	ARLYN	Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
L335896	u6204	m415	BREE	Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
L335894	u6203	m415	ARLYN	Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
L335893	u6204	m415	BREE	Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
L335892	u6203	m415	ARLYN	Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
L335857	u6215	m415	TRINA	Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
L335856	u6204	m415	BREE	She was with you after she left Frank.
L335855	u6215	m415	TRINA	Why? She's a junkie.
L335854	u6204	m415	BREE	Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
L335853	u6215	m415	TRINA	Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
L335852	u6204	m415	BREE	Uh uh.
L335851	u6215	m415	TRINA	Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
L335850	u6204	m415	BREE	Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
L335680	u6204	m415	BREE	And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
L335679	u6210	m415	MR. FABER	Yes?
L335678	u6204	m415	BREE	Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
L335677	u6210	m415	MR. FABER	Please --
L335676	u6204	m415	BREE	-- May I? It's so --
L335675	u6204	m415	BREE	And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
L335674	u6210	m415	MR. FABER	Mm.
L335673	u6204	m415	BREE	And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
L335672	u6210	m415	MR. FABER	Yes?
L335671	u6204	m415	BREE	Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
L335670	u6210	m415	MR. FABER	Sure dear, yes.
L335669	u6204	m415	BREE	It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
L335668	u6210	m415	MR. FABER	Enjoy.  Well --
L336012	u6204	m415	BREE	I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
L336011	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	Didn't want you.
L336010	u6204	m415	BREE	The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
L336009	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	You think people hate you.
L336008	u6204	m415	BREE	Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
L336007	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	Sorry. 
L336006	u6204	m415	BREE	Do you always have to repeat?
L336005	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	Don't belong?
L336004	u6204	m415	BREE	All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
L335999	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
L335998	u6204	m415	BREE	I do not love him.
L335997	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
L335996	u6204	m415	BREE	Guess!
L335995	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	I'd just be guessing.
L335994	u6204	m415	BREE	I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
L336195	u6209	m415	LELA	Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
L336194	u6204	m415	BREE	Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
L336193	u6209	m415	LELA	Yes indeed.
L336192	u6204	m415	BREE	Look -- could I use your phone?
L336191	u6209	m415	LELA	Well I have to close up now.
L336190	u6204	m415	BREE	No.
L336189	u6209	m415	LELA	-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
L336126	u6204	m415	BREE	Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
L336125	u6214	m415	TRASK	Like for you to look for the man.
L336124	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh no.
L336123	u6214	m415	TRASK	Here please.
L336122	u6204	m415	BREE	I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
L336121	u6214	m415	TRASK	From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
L336120	u6204	m415	BREE	Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
L336119	u6214	m415	TRASK	No, that's not --
L336118	u6204	m415	BREE	What was better? I made better bait?
L336117	u6214	m415	TRASK	I guess he figured it was better.
L336116	u6204	m415	BREE	Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
L336115	u6214	m415	TRASK	We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
L336114	u6204	m415	BREE	Why isn't he locked up?
L336113	u6214	m415	TRASK	Well we're pretty --
L336112	u6204	m415	BREE	You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
L336111	u6214	m415	TRASK	Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
L336110	u6204	m415	BREE	Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
L336109	u6214	m415	TRASK	No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
L336108	u6204	m415	BREE	So do I.
L336107	u6214	m415	TRASK	A few more days. We know who did this.
L336106	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
L336105	u6214	m415	TRASK	Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
L336248	u6204	m415	BREE	Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
L336247	u6205	m415	CABLE	Oh no, I don't think --

L336245	u6205	m415	CABLE	Excuse me Miss Daniel?
L336244	u6204	m415	BREE	I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
L336243	u6205	m415	CABLE	Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
L336242	u6204	m415	BREE	If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
L336241	u6205	m415	CABLE	It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
L336240	u6204	m415	BREE	Will you let me go then?
L336239	u6205	m415	CABLE	I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
L336236	u6205	m415	CABLE	Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
L336235	u6204	m415	BREE	Yes.
L336234	u6205	m415	CABLE	No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
L336233	u6204	m415	BREE	Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
L336232	u6205	m415	CABLE	You have no idea what I'm talking about.
L336229	u6205	m415	CABLE	All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
L336228	u6204	m415	BREE	-- Yes.
L336227	u6205	m415	CABLE	-- We can talk --
L336226	u6204	m415	BREE	Yes -- all right --
L336225	u6205	m415	CABLE	Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
L336283	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No. I'm sore.
L336282	u6204	m415	BREE	Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
L336281	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Can you use these?
L336280	u6204	m415	BREE	You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
L336279	u6208	m415	KLUTE	OK.
L336278	u6204	m415	BREE	Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
L336276	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
L336275	u6204	m415	BREE	What?
L336274	u6208	m415	KLUTE	They don't scare me any more.
L336273	u6204	m415	BREE	How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
L336272	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I don't think so.
L336271	u6204	m415	BREE	Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
L336270	u6208	m415	KLUTE	About what?
L336269	u6204	m415	BREE	Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
L336268	u6204	m415	BREE	You could at least look at me!
L336267	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I am.
L336266	u6204	m415	BREE	You wanted to, or you are?
L336265	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
L336264	u6204	m415	BREE	Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
L336262	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Mm.
L336261	u6204	m415	BREE	You're going back?
L336260	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Mm.
L336259	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
L336258	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
L336176	u6204	m415	BREE	Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
L336175	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
L336104	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Trask wants to talk with you.
L336103	u6204	m415	BREE	Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
L336101	u6204	m415	BREE	Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
L336100	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Why couldn't you stay here with me?
L336099	u6204	m415	BREE	How do you know how bad it was?
L336098	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
L336097	u6204	m415	BREE	Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
L336096	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I called Trina.
L336095	u6204	m415	BREE	With Trina.
L336094	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Where'd you spend last night?
L336093	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
L336092	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
L336091	u6204	m415	BREE	Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
L336074	u6204	m415	BREE	You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
L336073	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Go down in my room.

L336071	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Bree --
L336070	u6204	m415	BREE	My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
L336069	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
L336067	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Drop it.

L336061	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
L336060	u6204	m415	BREE	Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
L336059	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I was wondering what that was.
L336058	u6204	m415	BREE	You and I -- a relationship.
L336057	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What?
L336056	u6204	m415	BREE	Spangler says we have a relationship.
L336054	u6204	m415	BREE	Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
L336053	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What am I supposed to say?
L336052	u6204	m415	BREE	Is that all you have to say?
L336051	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Yeah.
L336050	u6204	m415	BREE	I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
L335991	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Yup.
L335990	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.

L335988	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Mm.
L335987	u6204	m415	BREE	I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
L335985	u6208	m415	KLUTE	My bed.
L335984	u6204	m415	BREE	I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
L335980	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I don't like getting splashed.
L335979	u6204	m415	BREE	No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
L335978	u6208	m415	KLUTE	We did this before.
L335977	u6204	m415	BREE	Please.

L335970	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
L335969	u6204	m415	BREE	Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
L335968	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
L335967	u6204	m415	BREE	No.
L335966	u6208	m415	KLUTE	You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
L335965	u6204	m415	BREE	I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
L335964	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Ligourin: How could you do it?
L335963	u6204	m415	BREE	I don't get you.
L335962	u6208	m415	KLUTE	How can you do it to yourself?
L335961	u6204	m415	BREE	What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
L335960	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Just let me know when you are going out and where --
L335959	u6204	m415	BREE	Why?
L335958	u6208	m415	KLUTE	The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
L335957	u6204	m415	BREE	Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
L335956	u6208	m415	KLUTE	The same as Jane McKenna.
L335955	u6204	m415	BREE	How?
L335954	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
L335884	u6208	m415	KLUTE	But if it's someone else I do.
L335883	u6204	m415	BREE	-- Then you don't need me.
L335882	u6208	m415	KLUTE	If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
L335881	u6204	m415	BREE	What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
L335880	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What's the matter?
L335846	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Don't worry.
L335845	u6204	m415	BREE	I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
L335844	u6208	m415	KLUTE	You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
L335843	u6204	m415	BREE	Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
L335842	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
L335841	u6204	m415	BREE	Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
L335840	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
L335839	u6204	m415	BREE	Arlyn Page.
L335838	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
L335837	u6204	m415	BREE	When?
L335836	u6208	m415	KLUTE	You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
L335826	u6204	m415	BREE	Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
L335825	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Thanks.
L335824	u6204	m415	BREE	What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
L335819	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
L335818	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
L335816	u6204	m415	BREE	So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
L335815	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Mm.
L335814	u6204	m415	BREE	Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
L335813	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Not much point to this, is there?
L335812	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
L335811	u6204	m415	BREE	It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
L335810	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It's kind of late.
L335807	u6204	m415	BREE	Goodbye.
L335806	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
L335805	u6204	m415	BREE	-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
L335804	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Yeah, you got to me.
L335803	u6204	m415	BREE	Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
L335802	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Well --
L335801	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
L335800	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No, I said what did you think.
L335799	u6204	m415	BREE	You said it was!
L335798	u6208	m415	KLUTE	And I don't think that was Tom.
L335797	u6204	m415	BREE	What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
L335796	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Try some other ways. 
L335795	u6204	m415	BREE	What're you gonna do next?
L335794	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I don't see anything, do you?
L335793	u6204	m415	BREE	Is there anything more I could --
L335792	u6208	m415	KLUTE	You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
L335791	u6204	m415	BREE	Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
L335790	u6208	m415	KLUTE	You said you wanted these.
L335789	u6204	m415	BREE	I thought you were going back to the apartment.
L335788	u6204	m415	BREE	Well -- she's dead.
L335787	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
L335786	u6204	m415	BREE	About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
L335785	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
L335784	u6204	m415	BREE	Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
L335783	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No.
L335782	u6204	m415	BREE	Did you like my friend Frankie?
L335759	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Is that what you gave him?
L335758	u6204	m415	BREE	What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
L335756	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Well, let's go down and ask him.
L335755	u6204	m415	BREE	He never told me.
L335754	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Do you know where he got the dumper?
L335753	u6204	m415	BREE	You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
L335752	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
L335751	u6204	m415	BREE	Can't you get him?
L335750	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What do you think?
L335749	u6204	m415	BREE	Well do you think it was him?
L335745	u6204	m415	BREE	You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
L335744	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
L335743	u6204	m415	BREE	I go on rounds.
L335742	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
L335739	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
L335738	u6204	m415	BREE	You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
L335736	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No thanks.
L335735	u6204	m415	BREE	I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
L335734	u6208	m415	KLUTE	-- OK?
L335733	u6204	m415	BREE	What? This?
L335730	u6204	m415	BREE	Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.

L335724	u6208	m415	KLUTE	-- OK --
L335723	u6204	m415	BREE	Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
L335721	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
L335720	u6204	m415	BREE	Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
L335719	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
L335718	u6204	m415	BREE	You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
L335717	u6208	m415	KLUTE	How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
L335716	u6204	m415	BREE	How would I remember?
L335715	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
L335714	u6204	m415	BREE	Most of them.
L335713	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
L335711	u6204	m415	BREE	Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
L335710	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
L335709	u6204	m415	BREE	Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
L335708	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
L335707	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What about everything since?
L335706	u6204	m415	BREE	Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
L335704	u6204	m415	BREE	I can't say he was anybody!
L335703	u6208	m415	KLUTE	But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
L335702	u6204	m415	BREE	Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
L335701	u6208	m415	KLUTE	What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
L335700	u6204	m415	BREE	You remind me of my uncle.
L335698	u6204	m415	BREE	All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
L335697	u6208	m415	KLUTE	-- Tuscarora --
L335696	u6204	m415	BREE	A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
L335694	u6204	m415	BREE	Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
L335693	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Company outing or picnic or something like that.
L335688	u6204	m415	BREE	Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
L335687	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Could I ask some questions?
L335686	u6204	m415	BREE	If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
L335685	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No, I'm look --
L335684	u6204	m415	BREE	Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
L335624	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Mm.
L335623	u6204	m415	BREE	And you just want to ask me a few questions?
L335622	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Mm.
L335621	u6204	m415	BREE	You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
L335620	u6204	m415	BREE	Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
L335619	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Will you let me ask you some questions?
L335618	u6204	m415	BREE	Honest?
L335617	u6208	m415	KLUTE	You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
L335616	u6204	m415	BREE	Why?
L335615	u6208	m415	KLUTE	He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
L335614	u6204	m415	BREE	Gee.
L335613	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
L335612	u6204	m415	BREE	Who?
L335611	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
L335610	u6204	m415	BREE	You said that.
L335609	u6208	m415	KLUTE	My name's John Klute.
L335608	u6204	m415	BREE	What about?
L335606	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
L335605	u6204	m415	BREE	What is it?
L336171	u6205	m415	CABLE	Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
L336170	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Well --
L336169	u6205	m415	CABLE	No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
L336168	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Just send me a money order.
L336167	u6205	m415	CABLE	Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
L336166	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
L336165	u6205	m415	CABLE	I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
L336162	u6208	m415	KLUTE	All right, but I'm going to see that list.
L336161	u6205	m415	CABLE	Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
L336160	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
L336159	u6205	m415	CABLE	No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
L336158	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
L336157	u6205	m415	CABLE	I can't follow you.
L336156	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
L336155	u6205	m415	CABLE	You were hired to look for Tom.
L336154	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
L336153	u6205	m415	CABLE	What?
L336152	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
L336151	u6205	m415	CABLE	You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
L336150	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Someone's been doing all these things.
L336149	u6205	m415	CABLE	You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
L336148	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
L336147	u6205	m415	CABLE	That who?
L336146	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
L336145	u6205	m415	CABLE	You must be discouraged.
L336144	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
L336143	u6205	m415	CABLE	Some mistake perhaps that --
L336142	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
L336141	u6205	m415	CABLE	It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
L336140	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
L336139	u6205	m415	CABLE	I'm sorry. I don't understand.
L336138	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
L336137	u6205	m415	CABLE	You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
L336136	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Yeah, two things Pete, that --
L336135	u6205	m415	CABLE	I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
L336134	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Yeah.
L336133	u6205	m415	CABLE	I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
L336132	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Well as a matter of --
L336131	u6205	m415	CABLE	I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
L336130	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Well there's a couple --
L336129	u6205	m415	CABLE	Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
L335931	u6205	m415	CABLE	I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
L335930	u6208	m415	KLUTE	How is it back there?
L335929	u6205	m415	CABLE	I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
L335926	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It's got to make sense some way.
L335925	u6205	m415	CABLE	You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
L335924	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
L335923	u6205	m415	CABLE	Where, how?
L335922	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I better keep looking.
L335921	u6205	m415	CABLE	Then, close the case.
L335920	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
L335919	u6205	m415	CABLE	All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
L335916	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I believed her, Pete.
L335915	u6205	m415	CABLE	She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
L336048	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Goodbye, Pete.
L336047	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	Thank you. Goodbye, John.
L336046	u6208	m415	KLUTE	All right.
L336045	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
L336044	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I wanted to give it to you first.
L336043	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
L336042	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It's in the report.
L336041	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	Have you discussed this with them?
L336040	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
L336039	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
L336036	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
L336035	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	What's in it?
L336034	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
L336033	u6208	m415	KLUTE	It's not so bad.
L336032	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
L336031	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
L336030	u6206	m415	CABLE'S VOICE	John, how are you?
L335781	u6207	m415	FRANK	Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
L335780	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
L335779	u6207	m415	FRANK	You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
L335778	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
L335777	u6207	m415	FRANK	OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
L335776	u6208	m415	KLUTE	She told me.
L335775	u6207	m415	FRANK	OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
L335774	u6207	m415	FRANK	Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
L335773	u6208	m415	KLUTE	They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
L335772	u6207	m415	FRANK	Two years ago? Sorry.
L335771	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
L335770	u6207	m415	FRANK	I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
L335769	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I've just got a few --
L335768	u6207	m415	FRANK	I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
L335658	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
L335657	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I think she's trying that.
L335656	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
L335655	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Has she talked with you since prison?
L335654	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
L335653	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Did she talk about him to you?
L335652	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	Not unusual.
L335651	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
L335650	u6212	m415	SPANGLER	-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
L336089	u6208	m415	KLUTE	He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
L336088	u6211	m415	ROSS	Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
L336078	u6211	m415	ROSS	What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
L336077	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
L336076	u6211	m415	ROSS	But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
L335558	u6211	m415	ROSS	Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
L335557	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No.
L335556	u6211	m415	ROSS	Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
L335555	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Everybody's got some, I guess.
L335554	u6211	m415	ROSS	Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
L335553	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No.
L335552	u6211	m415	ROSS	Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
L335551	u6208	m415	KLUTE	No.
L335550	u6211	m415	ROSS	Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
L335549	u6208	m415	KLUTE	We grew up together. Kids.
L335548	u6211	m415	ROSS	You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
L335547	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I know Tom Grunemann.
L335546	u6211	m415	ROSS	Then how are you involved?
L335545	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Town Police.
L335544	u6211	m415	ROSS	Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
L335543	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
L336087	u6214	m415	TRASK	If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
L336086	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Nobody's seen that.
L336085	u6214	m415	TRASK	It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
L336084	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I left them here. I was doing some work here.
L336083	u6214	m415	TRASK	Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
L336027	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I don't believe Tom's alive.
L336026	u6214	m415	TRASK	We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
L336025	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
L336024	u6214	m415	TRASK	What else do you know?
L336023	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
L336022	u6214	m415	TRASK	Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
L336021	u6208	m415	KLUTE	But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
L336018	u6214	m415	TRASK	Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
L336017	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
L336016	u6214	m415	TRASK	Think this is our guy?
L335952	u6208	m415	KLUTE	Yeah.
L335951	u6214	m415	TRASK	Well?
L335950	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I looked it up.
L335949	u6214	m415	TRASK	That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
L335918	u6208	m415	KLUTE	I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
L335917	u6214	m415	TRASK	He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
L335633	u6214	m415	TRASK	Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
L335632	u6208	m415	KLUTE	That's a lot of people to die unknown.
L335582	u6211	m415	ROSS	Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
L335581	u6213	m415	STREIGER	We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
L335580	u6211	m415	ROSS	Yes sir, we know he --
L335579	u6213	m415	STREIGER	Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
L335578	u6213	m415	STREIGER	Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
L335577	u6211	m415	ROSS	Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
L335576	u6213	m415	STREIGER	Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
L335575	u6211	m415	ROSS	The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
L335571	u6211	m415	ROSS	Trask --
L335570	u6213	m415	STREIGER	Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
L335567	u6211	m415	ROSS	No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
L335566	u6213	m415	STREIGER	Are you closing the case?
L347669	u6289	m421	BECK	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
L347668	u6293	m421	DOC	Be careful with it.
L347660	u6293	m421	DOC	Intelligence may not be the right word...
L347659	u6289	m421	BECK	That it acquires intelligence from its victims?

L347588	u6293	m421	DOC	Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
L347587	u6293	m421	DOC	It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.

L347401	u6289	m421	BECK	Something wrong, Cobb?
L347229	u6289	m421	BECK	You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.

L353905	u6324	m423	BEN	What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
L353904	u6351	m423	SAM	You got to investigate. No question about it.
L353903	u6324	m423	BEN	If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.

L353896	u6351	m423	SAM	So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
L353895	u6324	m423	BEN	Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
L353894	u6351	m423	SAM	You got a cause of death?

L353884	u6351	m423	SAM	Skinny?
L353883	u6324	m423	BEN	Yeah, this is Skinny.

L353881	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
L353880	u6324	m423	BEN	Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
L353879	u6351	m423	SAM	September '97, that's all she wrote.
L353878	u6324	m423	BEN	I hear they're closing that post down.

L353876	u6324	m423	BEN	How's business?
L353875	u6351	m423	SAM	Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
L353874	u6324	m423	BEN	Sam the Man.
L353765	u6325	m423	BUDDY	Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
L353764	u6353	m423	WADE	You little pissant--
L353763	u6325	m423	BUDDY	There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
L353762	u6353	m423	WADE	You're fired. You're outta the department.
L353761	u6325	m423	BUDDY	Whole different story; isn't it?
L353760	u6353	m423	WADE	Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
L353759	u6325	m423	BUDDY	You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
L353757	u6353	m423	WADE	You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
L353756	u6325	m423	BUDDY	I'm not picking it up.
L353755	u6353	m423	WADE	You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
L353754	u6325	m423	BUDDY	That's not the point.
L353753	u6353	m423	WADE	There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
L353752	u6325	m423	BUDDY	It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
L353748	u6353	m423	WADE	"I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is ""Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."""
L353747	u6325	m423	BUDDY	So?
L353746	u6353	m423	WADE	Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
L353745	u6325	m423	BUDDY	What's that for?
L354691	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
L354690	u6351	m423	SAM	You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
L354689	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"I only got my little girl now, he says, ""she's my lifeline."" Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people."
L354688	u6351	m423	SAM	I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
L354687	u6326	m423	BUNNY	This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
L354686	u6351	m423	SAM	What?
L354685	u6326	m423	BUNNY	350 pounds.
L354683	u6326	m423	BUNNY	No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
L354682	u6351	m423	SAM	It wasn't just you, Bunny.
L354681	u6326	m423	BUNNY	You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
L354680	u6351	m423	SAM	Suppose not.
L354679	u6326	m423	BUNNY	You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
L354678	u6351	m423	SAM	You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
L354677	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
L354676	u6351	m423	SAM	No. You?
L354675	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Least he never called me that. With me, it was always ""high-strung."" ""My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung."" Or ""tightly wound,"" that was another one. You seeing anyone?"
L354674	u6351	m423	SAM	Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
L354673	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says ""Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now""."
L354672	u6351	m423	SAM	Best part of the job.
L354671	u6326	m423	BUNNY	You look awful good in that uniform, though.
L354670	u6351	m423	SAM	Same weight I always was.
L354669	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Daddy calls it an ""altercation."" How you doing, Sam? You look skinny."
L354668	u6351	m423	SAM	You were in a fight--
L354667	u6326	m423	BUNNY	--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
L354666	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, well--
L354665	u6326	m423	BUNNY	--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
L354664	u6351	m423	SAM	You look good--
L354663	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
L354662	u6351	m423	SAM	No, you look good. I was just wondering.
L354661	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Do I seem jumpy?
L354660	u6351	m423	SAM	Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
L354659	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6"", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?"
L354658	u6351	m423	SAM	You still going to all the home games?
L354657	u6351	m423	SAM	Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
L354656	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Oh. Right. And you're in--?
L354655	u6351	m423	SAM	That's in Maverick County.
L354654	u6326	m423	BUNNY	The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
L354719	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	He never asked her.
L354718	u6332	m423	DEL	My mother said he never asked about--
L354717	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
L354716	u6332	m423	DEL	It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
L354715	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
L354714	u6332	m423	DEL	I'm a colonel.
L354713	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
L354712	u6332	m423	DEL	Uncle Al--
L354711	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
L354710	u6332	m423	DEL	Where'd he get all this?

L354700	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Come on in.
L354699	u6332	m423	DEL	If it's too late--
L354698	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Come on in--
L354697	u6332	m423	DEL	Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
L354696	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Hey, it's the General.
L354199	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	So that's him--
L354198	u6332	m423	DEL	You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
L354612	u6344	m423	OTIS	Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
L354611	u6328	m423	CHET	My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
L354610	u6344	m423	OTIS	By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
L354609	u6328	m423	CHET	So I'm part-Indian?
L354608	u6344	m423	OTIS	These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
L354607	u6328	m423	CHET	So how come you got into all this?
L354606	u6344	m423	OTIS	When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
L354605	u6328	m423	CHET	He's still pissed off about it.
L354604	u6344	m423	OTIS	Didn't have a father?
L354603	u6328	m423	CHET	I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
L354602	u6344	m423	OTIS	Well--
L354601	u6328	m423	CHET	Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
L354600	u6344	m423	OTIS	PDA?
L354599	u6328	m423	CHET	No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
L354598	u6344	m423	OTIS	He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
L354597	u6328	m423	CHET	Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
L354596	u6344	m423	OTIS	You didn't go telling your father you were here?
L354595	u6328	m423	CHET	That guy who got shot--
L354594	u6344	m423	OTIS	I got a pretty good guess.
L354593	u6328	m423	CHET	You know who I am?
L354592	u6344	m423	OTIS	They were in the Army. Like your father.
L354591	u6328	m423	CHET	But they were Indians themselves.
L354590	u6344	m423	OTIS	Same as they done in Mexico.
L354589	u6328	m423	CHET	They fought against the Indians?
L354588	u6344	m423	OTIS	Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
L354587	u6344	m423	OTIS	They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
L354586	u6328	m423	CHET	So they stayed in Florida?
L354585	u6344	m423	OTIS	They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
L354584	u6328	m423	CHET	The Trail of Tears.
L354583	u6344	m423	OTIS	He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
L354582	u6344	m423	OTIS	Both.
L354581	u6328	m423	CHET	He a Black man or an Indian?
L354580	u6344	m423	OTIS	Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
L353795	u6344	m423	OTIS	Go out through the back.
L353794	u6328	m423	CHET	No sir.
L353793	u6344	m423	OTIS	You weren't in here tonight, were you?
L354792	u6328	m423	CHET	Cool.

L354783	u6332	m423	DEL	No.
L354782	u6328	m423	CHET	You wouldn't?
L354781	u6332	m423	DEL	Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
L354777	u6332	m423	DEL	So you're going into the Army?
L354776	u6328	m423	CHET	You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.

L354084	u6328	m423	CHET	Dad, can I talk to you about track?
L354083	u6332	m423	DEL	Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.

L354076	u6332	m423	DEL	Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
L354440	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
L354439	u6351	m423	SAM	Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
L354438	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
L354435	u6351	m423	SAM	You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?

L353663	u6341	m423	MIKEY	This place is a gold mine.
L354161	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	You know who it was they dug up?
L354160	u6330	m423	CLIFF	They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
L354151	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
L354150	u6330	m423	CLIFF	I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
L354149	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
L354148	u6330	m423	CLIFF	You could take it--
L354147	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
L354146	u6330	m423	CLIFF	We should just do it.
L354145	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	We been through this before--
L354144	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Seriously, I think we should get married.
L354143	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	Seriously.
L354142	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
L354141	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	So where does that put us?
L353967	u6330	m423	CLIFF	She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
L353966	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
L353965	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
L353964	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	You spoil 'em, Cliff.
L353956	u6330	m423	CLIFF	He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
L353955	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
L354155	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
L354154	u6351	m423	SAM	Pleased to meet you.
L354153	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
L353686	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
L353685	u6351	m423	SAM	Treasure hunter?
L353684	u6351	m423	SAM	Masons been around a long while.
L353683	u6330	m423	CLIFF	That ring--
L353682	u6351	m423	SAM	I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
L353681	u6330	m423	CLIFF	This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
L353680	u6351	m423	SAM	I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
L354140	u6331	m423	CODY	Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
L354139	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah. I bet he would.
L354138	u6331	m423	CODY	--but just as a kind of safety tip.
L354137	u6331	m423	CODY	--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
L354135	u6331	m423	CODY	Take that pair over in the corner--
L354134	u6351	m423	SAM	You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
L354133	u6331	m423	CODY	You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
L354132	u6351	m423	SAM	Good deal you were born down here, then.
L354131	u6331	m423	CODY	--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
L354130	u6351	m423	SAM	If the next guy's a redneck.
L354129	u6331	m423	CODY	Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
L353871	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Appreciate it, sir.
L353870	u6332	m423	DEL	I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
L353866	u6332	m423	DEL	I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
L353865	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
L353864	u6332	m423	DEL	Substance abuse?
L353863	u6341	m423	MIKEY	You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
L353858	u6332	m423	DEL	Have we had trouble there before?
L353857	u6341	m423	MIKEY	There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
L354197	u6344	m423	OTIS	Because I'm your father.
L354196	u6332	m423	DEL	Why would you want to do that?
L354195	u6344	m423	OTIS	I gonna meet that family of yours?
L354194	u6344	m423	OTIS	A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
L354193	u6332	m423	DEL	And people make their choice--
L354192	u6344	m423	OTIS	Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
L354191	u6332	m423	DEL	I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
L354190	u6344	m423	OTIS	Right.
L354189	u6332	m423	DEL	The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
L354188	u6344	m423	OTIS	I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
L354187	u6332	m423	DEL	That's right.
L354186	u6344	m423	OTIS	Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
L354185	u6332	m423	DEL	We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
L354184	u6344	m423	OTIS	Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
L354183	u6332	m423	DEL	I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
L354182	u6344	m423	OTIS	This is an official visit, then--
L354181	u6332	m423	DEL	So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
L354180	u6344	m423	OTIS	So.
L354178	u6332	m423	DEL	Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
L354177	u6344	m423	OTIS	This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
L354176	u6344	m423	OTIS	If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
L354175	u6332	m423	DEL	Deal drugs in the bathroom--
L354174	u6344	m423	OTIS	It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
L354173	u6332	m423	DEL	You get much of that in here?
L354172	u6344	m423	OTIS	That's where he fell.
L354171	u6332	m423	DEL	That where he was shot?
L354170	u6344	m423	OTIS	Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
L354169	u6332	m423	DEL	Black Seminoles?
L354463	u6353	m423	WADE	Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
L354462	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
L354461	u6353	m423	WADE	You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
L354460	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Protection?
L354459	u6353	m423	WADE	There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
L354458	u6353	m423	WADE	Bandidos, Injuns--
L354457	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Reputation?
L354456	u6353	m423	WADE	You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
L354455	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Eladio Cruz.
L354454	u6353	m423	WADE	This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
L354453	u6333	m423	ELADIO	I haven't seen anybody doing that.
L354452	u6353	m423	WADE	I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
L354451	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
L354450	u6353	m423	WADE	What's in the back?
L354449	u6333	m423	ELADIO	No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
L354448	u6353	m423	WADE	Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
L354765	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
L354764	u6355	m423	YOUNG MERCEDES	Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
L354763	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Como se llama? [What's your name?]
L354762	u6333	m423	ELADIO	No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
L354761	u6355	m423	YOUNG MERCEDES	Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
L354760	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
L354759	u6355	m423	YOUNG MERCEDES	No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
L354758	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Aqui! [Here!]
L354757	u6355	m423	YOUNG MERCEDES	Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
L354770	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
L354769	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
L354768	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
L354767	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
L354766	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
L354755	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Tipico.
L354754	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	We have a daughter.
L354753	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	This girl has a child?
L354752	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
L354751	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I thought you were married!
L354750	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
L354749	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	This girl is a friend of yours?
L354744	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
L354743	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
L354742	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
L354739	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
L354738	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
L354737	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	We was crossin' the river--
L354736	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
L354735	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
L354734	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	You have somebody else out there?
L354733	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	I have some friends who have had a accident--
L354732	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
L354731	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
L354730	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
L354729	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
L354728	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Quien es? [Who is it?]
L354727	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Senora Cruz?
L354167	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
L354166	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
L354165	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Is very beautiful, your car.
L354164	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
L354163	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Es muy lindo, su coche--
L353781	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
L353780	u6335	m423	FENTON	Your mother was a saint.
L353772	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
L353771	u6335	m423	FENTON	Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
L353770	u6335	m423	FENTON	That Buddy was a cool breeze.
L353769	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Mas cerveza por favor.
L353742	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
L353741	u6335	m423	FENTON	'57, 1 believe--
L353740	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
L353737	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
L353736	u6335	m423	FENTON	Tell that one, Hollis--
L353733	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
L353732	u6335	m423	FENTON	They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
L353726	u6335	m423	FENTON	Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
L353725	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
L353724	u6335	m423	FENTON	Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
L353721	u6335	m423	FENTON	Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
L353720	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
L353718	u6335	m423	FENTON	He was a unique individual.
L353717	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
L353714	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	"He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. ""Old Fishbait,"" he says, ""never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."""
L353713	u6335	m423	FENTON	Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
L353712	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	"Fishbait, says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, ""What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?"" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, ""C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"""
L354227	u6351	m423	SAM	When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
L354226	u6336	m423	H.L.	When we backed you--
L354223	u6351	m423	SAM	We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
L354222	u6336	m423	H.L.	Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
L354219	u6351	m423	SAM	We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
L354218	u6336	m423	H.L.	That's a matter of interpretation--
L354217	u6351	m423	SAM	We don't need a new jail.
L354216	u6336	m423	H.L.	Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
L354211	u6351	m423	SAM	Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
L354210	u6336	m423	H.L.	That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
L354205	u6336	m423	H.L.	Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
L354204	u6351	m423	SAM	Seems like we have another one every week.
L354203	u6336	m423	H.L.	Historic occasion, isn't it?
L354816	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
L354815	u6351	m423	SAM	Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
L354812	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
L354811	u6351	m423	SAM	And the ten thousand?
L354810	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
L354805	u6351	m423	SAM	Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
L354804	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Buddy Deeds--
L354803	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
L354802	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
L354801	u6351	m423	SAM	Imonna find out one way or the other.
L354796	u6351	m423	SAM	Open late.
L354795	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Hey, Sam.
L354794	u6351	m423	SAM	Fellas.
L354578	u6351	m423	SAM	I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
L354577	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
L354576	u6351	m423	SAM	I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
L354575	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Do you?
L354574	u6351	m423	SAM	I got an idea what happened.
L354573	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
L354572	u6351	m423	SAM	Charley Wade.
L354571	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	We have a murder?
L354570	u6351	m423	SAM	You thought any more about our murder?
L354569	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
L354568	u6351	m423	SAM	Morning, Hollis.
L353939	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	And I understand why you might want to think he could.
L353938	u6351	m423	SAM	People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
L353937	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
L353936	u6351	m423	SAM	And Buddy was one of them.
L353935	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
L353934	u6351	m423	SAM	Besides my father, I mean.
L353933	u6351	m423	SAM	Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
L353932	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
L353931	u6351	m423	SAM	He still living?
L353930	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
L353929	u6351	m423	SAM	Bledso
L353928	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
L353927	u6351	m423	SAM	You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
L353926	u6351	m423	SAM	All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
L353925	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
L353924	u6351	m423	SAM	You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
L353923	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
L353922	u6351	m423	SAM	We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
L353921	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
L353920	u6351	m423	SAM	No.
L353919	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	You go by your old house?
L353918	u6351	m423	SAM	I haven't been out here for a while.
L353917	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
L353916	u6351	m423	SAM	Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
L353915	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
L353914	u6351	m423	SAM	I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
L353779	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
L353778	u6351	m423	SAM	Right.
L353777	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
L353774	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
L353773	u6351	m423	SAM	Never heard from him again?
L353735	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
L353734	u6351	m423	SAM	That so?
L353731	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
L353730	u6351	m423	SAM	--Santiago.
L353729	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
L353723	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
L353722	u6351	m423	SAM	I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
L354225	u6351	m423	SAM	Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
L354224	u6338	m423	JORGE	There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
L354221	u6351	m423	SAM	It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
L354220	u6338	m423	JORGE	There was a mandate in the last election--
L354215	u6351	m423	SAM	Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
L354214	u6338	m423	JORGE	He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
L354213	u6351	m423	SAM	The Perdido thing?
L354212	u6338	m423	JORGE	I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
L354209	u6351	m423	SAM	"You ought to put up a banner-- ""Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy""--"
L354208	u6338	m423	JORGE	Sam--
L354207	u6351	m423	SAM	People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
L354206	u6338	m423	JORGE	We're building up tourism, Sam--
L354510	u6339	m423	MARISOL	You told me one time it was true love.
L354509	u6347	m423	PILAR	I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
L354508	u6339	m423	MARISOL	The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
L354507	u6347	m423	PILAR	The Sheriff.
L354506	u6339	m423	MARISOL	How 'bout the Sheriff?
L354505	u6347	m423	PILAR	All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
L354504	u6339	m423	MARISOL	You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
L354503	u6347	m423	PILAR	Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
L354502	u6339	m423	MARISOL	Your mother's family is Spanish?
L354501	u6347	m423	PILAR	Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
L354500	u6339	m423	MARISOL	Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
L354499	u6347	m423	PILAR	Steve?
L354498	u6339	m423	MARISOL	Steve called for you.
L354124	u6347	m423	PILAR	That boy--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
L354123	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I never said that. It was just that boy--
L354122	u6347	m423	PILAR	What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
L354121	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I felt that you could do better for yourself--
L354120	u6347	m423	PILAR	You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
L354119	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I never said that.
L354118	u6347	m423	PILAR	"Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- ""some chulo with grease under his nails."""
L354117	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I don't mean Fernando.
L354116	u6347	m423	PILAR	Thank you.
L354115	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
L354114	u6347	m423	PILAR	Nobody's too busy.
L354113	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I was too busy.
L354112	u6347	m423	PILAR	There must have been somebody.
L354111	u6347	m423	PILAR	How come you never got married again?
L354110	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	A little older than Paloma is now.
L354109	u6347	m423	PILAR	Right. When he was killed.
L354108	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	He was killed.
L354107	u6347	m423	PILAR	Mami, how old were you when my father--
L354106	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
L354105	u6347	m423	PILAR	Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
L354104	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Why would I want to go there?
L354103	u6347	m423	PILAR	No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
L354102	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
L354101	u6347	m423	PILAR	If you spent a little more time training them--
L354100	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
L354099	u6347	m423	PILAR	Well, you hire illegals--
L354098	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
L354097	u6347	m423	PILAR	Maybe you're just getting less patient.
L354096	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
L353991	u6351	m423	SAM	Do you remember the last time you saw him?
L353990	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
L353989	u6351	m423	SAM	People didn't complain?
L353988	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
L353987	u6351	m423	SAM	And my father?
L353986	u6342	m423	MINNIE	"Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, ""Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership."" But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime."
L353985	u6351	m423	SAM	He squeezed money out of you?
L353984	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
L353983	u6351	m423	SAM	You had to deal with him in running the club.
L353982	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Not if I can help it.
L353981	u6351	m423	SAM	So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
L353980	u6342	m423	MINNIE	We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
L353979	u6351	m423	SAM	He had the club out on the old trail road--
L353978	u6342	m423	MINNIE	I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
L353977	u6351	m423	SAM	You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
L353976	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
L353975	u6351	m423	SAM	I've seen 'em.
L353974	u6342	m423	MINNIE	You ever play one of these?
L353973	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, that's the story of my life.
L353972	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
L353971	u6351	m423	SAM	I'm Sheriff Deeds--
L353970	u6342	m423	MINNIE	That's me.
L353969	u6351	m423	SAM	Mrs. Bledsoe?
L354496	u6347	m423	PILAR	I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
L354495	u6343	m423	MOLLY	I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
L354494	u6347	m423	PILAR	I don't think you can take it personally--
L353705	u6347	m423	PILAR	He's going to wish he was dead.
L353704	u6343	m423	MOLLY	No. Is he sick?
L353703	u6347	m423	PILAR	Okay? He's not here?
L353702	u6343	m423	MOLLY	Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
L354799	u6344	m423	OTIS	Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
L354798	u6351	m423	SAM	Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
L354797	u6344	m423	OTIS	I'm not open. We were just talking.
L354041	u6351	m423	SAM	He ever accept cash for a favor?
L354040	u6344	m423	OTIS	Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
L354039	u6351	m423	SAM	What was your deal with him?
L354038	u6344	m423	OTIS	What about it?
L354037	u6351	m423	SAM	And when my father was Sheriff?
L354036	u6344	m423	OTIS	Could of been. That was white people's business.
L354035	u6351	m423	SAM	That was the night he disappeared?
L354034	u6344	m423	OTIS	Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
L354033	u6351	m423	SAM	And that was the last time you saw him?
L354032	u6344	m423	OTIS	I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
L354566	u6347	m423	PILAR	Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
L354565	u6345	m423	PALOMA	How come?
L354564	u6347	m423	PILAR	I only went for my last two years.
L354563	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
L354562	u6347	m423	PILAR	Enough with the clothes--
L354561	u6345	m423	PALOMA	I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
L354560	u6347	m423	PILAR	Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
L354559	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Can I get this?
L354558	u6347	m423	PILAR	Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
L354557	u6345	m423	PALOMA	You got in late last night.
L354556	u6347	m423	PILAR	It's Saturday.
L354555	u6345	m423	PALOMA	She finally got in--
L354351	u6347	m423	PILAR	What do you think?
L354350	u6345	m423	PALOMA	What's she singing about?
L354349	u6347	m423	PILAR	For a while.
L354348	u6345	m423	PALOMA	You gonna stay out here?
L354347	u6347	m423	PILAR	Yeah?
L354346	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Mom?
L354060	u6347	m423	PILAR	It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
L354059	u6345	m423	PALOMA	What?
L354058	u6347	m423	PILAR	Of course you can.
L354057	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Not if you have half a brain in your head.
L354378	u6346	m423	PETE	Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
L354377	u6351	m423	SAM	Murdered him?
L354376	u6346	m423	PETE	He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
L354375	u6351	m423	SAM	I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
L354374	u6346	m423	PETE	Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
L354373	u6351	m423	SAM	You built our patio while you  were on the county?
L354372	u6346	m423	PETE	It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
L354371	u6351	m423	SAM	Well, you were working there--
L354370	u6346	m423	PETE	And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
L354369	u6351	m423	SAM	So I've heard--
L354368	u6346	m423	PETE	He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
L354367	u6351	m423	SAM	I'm surprised he bothered with it.
L354366	u6346	m423	PETE	That's how I ruined my stomach.
L354365	u6346	m423	PETE	Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
L354364	u6351	m423	SAM	I thought he busted you a couple times.
L354363	u6346	m423	PETE	Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
L354362	u6346	m423	PETE	I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
L354361	u6351	m423	SAM	You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
L354360	u6346	m423	PETE	It was for personal consumption.
L354359	u6351	m423	SAM	You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
L354358	u6346	m423	PETE	Three months.
L354357	u6351	m423	SAM	How much you got left?
L354356	u6346	m423	PETE	Time marches on.
L354355	u6351	m423	SAM	Hey, Pete. How's it going?
L354354	u6346	m423	PETE	Morning, Sheriff.
L354836	u6347	m423	PILAR	Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
L354835	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah--
L354834	u6347	m423	PILAR	We start from scratch--
L354833	u6351	m423	SAM	If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
L354832	u6347	m423	PILAR	I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
L354830	u6351	m423	SAM	I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
L354829	u6347	m423	PILAR	From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
L354828	u6351	m423	SAM	"He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you ""our beautiful daughter"" in the letters she wrote to him."
L354827	u6347	m423	PILAR	They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
L354826	u6351	m423	SAM	Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
L354825	u6347	m423	PILAR	I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
L354824	u6351	m423	SAM	Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
L354823	u6347	m423	PILAR	Couple months before I was born--
L354822	u6351	m423	SAM	You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
L354821	u6347	m423	PILAR	She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
L354820	u6351	m423	SAM	You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
L354554	u6347	m423	PILAR	Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.

L354551	u6351	m423	SAM	Pilar--
L354550	u6347	m423	PILAR	It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
L354549	u6351	m423	SAM	I've felt that way, yeah.
L354548	u6347	m423	PILAR	Like your story is over.
L354547	u6351	m423	SAM	Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
L354546	u6347	m423	PILAR	There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
L354545	u6351	m423	SAM	Two years.

L354543	u6351	m423	SAM	More, I hope.
L354542	u6347	m423	PILAR	So what are we gonna do about this?
L354541	u6351	m423	SAM	I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
L354540	u6347	m423	PILAR	How come it feels the same?
L354539	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.

L354534	u6351	m423	SAM	You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
L354533	u6347	m423	PILAR	When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
L354532	u6351	m423	SAM	Nothing.
L354531	u6347	m423	PILAR	I mean what did we know about anything?
L354530	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354529	u6347	m423	PILAR	I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
L354528	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354527	u6347	m423	PILAR	We thought we were something, didn't we?
L354299	u6347	m423	PILAR	Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
L354298	u6351	m423	SAM	Pilar--
L354297	u6347	m423	PILAR	I should get back.
L354295	u6347	m423	PILAR	They've got me. Different thing.
L354294	u6351	m423	SAM	You've got your mother, your kids--
L354293	u6347	m423	PILAR	It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
L354292	u6351	m423	SAM	I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
L354291	u6347	m423	PILAR	You don't want to be Sheriff.
L354290	u6351	m423	SAM	Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
L354289	u6347	m423	PILAR	So why did you come back here, Sam?
L354288	u6351	m423	SAM	It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
L354287	u6347	m423	PILAR	Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
L354286	u6351	m423	SAM	Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
L354285	u6347	m423	PILAR	With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
L354284	u6351	m423	SAM	No--
L354283	u6347	m423	PILAR	He hates me.
L354282	u6351	m423	SAM	Nice-looking kid.
L354281	u6347	m423	PILAR	Amado.
L354280	u6351	m423	SAM	Your boy, there--
L354279	u6347	m423	PILAR	Weird what you remember.
L354278	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354277	u6347	m423	PILAR	I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
L354276	u6347	m423	PILAR	I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
L354275	u6351	m423	SAM	Most people did, yeah.
L354274	u6347	m423	PILAR	People liked him.
L354273	u6351	m423	SAM	They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
L354272	u6347	m423	PILAR	I thought you got through that pretty well.
L354271	u6347	m423	PILAR	So she tells me three times a week.
L354270	u6351	m423	SAM	She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
L354269	u6347	m423	PILAR	A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
L354268	u6351	m423	SAM	I see she built a place up here by the river.
L354267	u6347	m423	PILAR	I can't name anybody she does like these days.
L354266	u6351	m423	SAM	Your mother still doesn't like me.
L354265	u6351	m423	SAM	Want to take a walk?
L354264	u6347	m423	PILAR	Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
L354263	u6351	m423	SAM	Field trip?
L353852	u6347	m423	PILAR	Are you okay?
L353851	u6351	m423	SAM	He's all yours.
L353839	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
L353838	u6347	m423	PILAR	We haven't talked since high school.
L353837	u6351	m423	SAM	I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
L353836	u6351	m423	SAM	I'll see what's going on.
L353835	u6347	m423	PILAR	Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
L353834	u6351	m423	SAM	Got him here?
L353833	u6347	m423	PILAR	They've got my Amado.
L353832	u6351	m423	SAM	Something wrong?
L354399	u6349	m423	RAY	Well, it's a complicated issue--
L354398	u6351	m423	SAM	You think we need a new jail?
L354397	u6351	m423	SAM	I appreciate you telling me.
L354396	u6349	m423	RAY	I didn't want to be going around your back.
L354395	u6351	m423	SAM	Don't know if I'll still want it.
L354394	u6349	m423	RAY	How 'bout you?
L354393	u6351	m423	SAM	You'd do a good job.
L354392	u6349	m423	RAY	Yeah.
L354391	u6351	m423	SAM	They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
L354390	u6349	m423	RAY	Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
L354389	u6349	m423	RAY	Oh.
L354388	u6351	m423	SAM	Gotta be in person.
L354387	u6349	m423	RAY	They got telephones.
L354386	u6351	m423	SAM	No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
L354385	u6349	m423	RAY	The Republicans?
L354384	u6351	m423	SAM	I'm going over to the other side.
L354383	u6349	m423	RAY	Uh-huh.
L354382	u6351	m423	SAM	I been working on a few things.
L354381	u6349	m423	RAY	Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
L354380	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354379	u6349	m423	RAY	You're out early.
L353830	u6351	m423	SAM	Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
L353829	u6349	m423	RAY	Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
L353828	u6351	m423	SAM	Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
L353827	u6349	m423	RAY	Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
L353826	u6351	m423	SAM	The shooter local?
L353825	u6349	m423	RAY	Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
L354324	u6352	m423	SHADOW	You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
L354323	u6349	m423	RAY	This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
L354322	u6352	m423	SHADOW	White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
L354321	u6349	m423	RAY	Just doing my job.
L354320	u6352	m423	SHADOW	"You're the one who's a good boy. Man say ""fetch"" and you fetch--"
L354319	u6349	m423	RAY	You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
L354318	u6352	m423	SHADOW	You don't need to cuff me.
L354317	u6349	m423	RAY	Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
L354029	u6353	m423	WADE	And people better clear out of here! Now!
L354028	u6350	m423	RODERICK	This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
L354027	u6353	m423	WADE	What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
L354026	u6350	m423	RODERICK	No, Sheriff, I'm just--
L354025	u6353	m423	WADE	You telling me what to do, Roderick?
L354024	u6350	m423	RODERICK	You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
L354023	u6350	m423	RODERICK	Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
L354022	u6353	m423	WADE	That the problem, son?  You Slow?
L354021	u6350	m423	RODERICK	Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
L354342	u6359	m423	ZACK	The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
L354341	u6351	m423	SAM	Sure.
L354340	u6359	m423	ZACK	I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
L354339	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah. It's quiet--
L354338	u6359	m423	ZACK	We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
L354337	u6351	m423	SAM	I haven't seen anybody come by.
L354336	u6359	m423	ZACK	We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
L354335	u6351	m423	SAM	What's up?
L354334	u6359	m423	ZACK	Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
L354491	u6354	m423	WESLEY	The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
L354490	u6351	m423	SAM	You know who it was?
L354489	u6354	m423	WESLEY	Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
L354488	u6351	m423	SAM	Another woman?
L354487	u6354	m423	WESLEY	If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
L354486	u6354	m423	WESLEY	Me neither.
L354485	u6351	m423	SAM	No--
L354484	u6354	m423	WESLEY	They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
L354483	u6351	m423	SAM	You think he killed anybody in Korea?
L354482	u6354	m423	WESLEY	For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
L354481	u6351	m423	SAM	So when did Buddy leave?
L354480	u6354	m423	WESLEY	Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
L354477	u6354	m423	WESLEY	But you don't see much competition, do you?
L354476	u6351	m423	SAM	Hell of a spot to put a business.
L354475	u6354	m423	WESLEY	How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
L354474	u6351	m423	SAM	You sell much out here?
L354473	u6354	m423	WESLEY	--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
L354015	u6353	m423	WADE	Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
L354014	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Been away. Up to Houston.
L354013	u6353	m423	WADE	How come you don't took familiar?
L354009	u6353	m423	WADE	Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
L354008	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Runnin' numbers illegal.
L354007	u6353	m423	WADE	As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
L354005	u6353	m423	WADE	Why you think that was?
L354004	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	I know that.
L354003	u6353	m423	WADE	I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
L354002	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Uh-huh.
L354001	u6353	m423	WADE	One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
L354000	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Payne.
L353999	u6353	m423	WADE	Otis what?
L353998	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Name's Otis.
L353997	u6353	m423	WADE	I know you?
L354306	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	You believe that?
L354305	u6357	m423	YOUNG PILAR	It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
L354304	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
L354303	u6357	m423	YOUNG PILAR	He's gonna find out.
L354302	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	He doesn't need to know all my business.
L354301	u6357	m423	YOUNG PILAR	You going to tell him?
L354300	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	You going to tell her?
L354938	u6367	m424	HARRY	You bet.
L354937	u6360	m424	BELLBOY	Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
L354936	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hello, L.A.
L354933	u6367	m424	HARRY	Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
L354932	u6360	m424	BELLBOY	Thirty-five bucks.
L354931	u6367	m424	HARRY	How much?
L354930	u6360	m424	BELLBOY	You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
L354929	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah?
L354923	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah.  It's French.
L354922	u6360	m424	BELLBOY	Mister D'Amour?
L355369	u6361	m424	BILLY	Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
L355368	u6367	m424	HARRY	Thanks, Billy.
L355365	u6361	m424	BILLY	I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
L355364	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hokey enough for you?
L355359	u6361	m424	BILLY	Knew what?
L355358	u6367	m424	HARRY	That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
L355357	u6361	m424	BILLY	Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
L355356	u6367	m424	HARRY	What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
L355355	u6361	m424	BILLY	I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
L355354	u6367	m424	HARRY	Maybe they're not tricks.
L355352	u6367	m424	HARRY	A Nix specialty?
L355351	u6361	m424	BILLY	Take a look at this.
L355349	u6361	m424	BILLY	doorway) And who's that?
L355348	u6367	m424	HARRY	That's Butterfield...
L355345	u6367	m424	HARRY	That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
L355344	u6361	m424	BILLY	I could have lost my fucking hands.
L355339	u6361	m424	BILLY	Nope.
L355338	u6367	m424	HARRY	Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
L355337	u6361	m424	BILLY	I love weird.
L355336	u6367	m424	HARRY	My life was too weird for her.
L355335	u6361	m424	BILLY	Why?
L355334	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
L355333	u6361	m424	BILLY	You ever been married?
L355332	u6367	m424	HARRY	You heard right.
L355331	u6361	m424	BILLY	I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
L355328	u6361	m424	BILLY	It'll be something hokey.
L355327	u6367	m424	HARRY	How?
L355326	u6361	m424	BILLY	I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
L355230	u6361	m424	BILLY	I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
L355229	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is he?
L355228	u6361	m424	BILLY	Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
L355227	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix?
L355226	u6361	m424	BILLY	Nix.
L355225	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who?
L355224	u6361	m424	BILLY	I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
L355223	u6367	m424	HARRY	They go together.
L355222	u6361	m424	BILLY	I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
L354927	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	That's so cool.
L354926	u6367	m424	HARRY	Right.
L354921	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	Isn't that French for something?
L354920	u6367	m424	HARRY	Right.
L354919	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	D'Amour.
L354918	u6367	m424	HARRY	D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
L354917	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	How'd you spell that again?
L355147	u6367	m424	HARRY	All right.  It was...
L355146	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Who did this?
L355145	u6367	m424	HARRY	I told you --
L355144	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Who did this?
L355143	u6367	m424	HARRY	Deep shit?
L355142	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
L355141	u6367	m424	HARRY	Beats me.
L355140	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Why would I do that?
L355139	u6367	m424	HARRY	You did.  Didn't you?
L354998	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	It's an illusion.
L354997	u6370	m424	MILLER	What about death?
L354996	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Death.
L354995	u6370	m424	MILLER	About?
L354994	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
L354993	u6370	m424	MILLER	"What do you mean, ""all of us?"""
L354992	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
L354991	u6370	m424	MILLER	He won't.
L354990	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	I don't want him getting in the way.
L354989	u6370	m424	MILLER	No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
L354988	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	He's a priest?
L354987	u6370	m424	MILLER	I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
L354986	u6370	m424	MILLER	I know him.  I saw him.
L354985	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
L355547	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	It's him... it's him.
L355546	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
L355539	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
L355538	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	If you've lied to me to me --
L355537	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Not yet.
L355536	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Anything?
L355467	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	You'll do more.than that.
L355466	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'll tell you.
L355464	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I don't know.
L355463	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	So tell me where Nix is buried.
L355462	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Don't.
L355461	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	I could scoop them out.
L355460	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Please.
L355534	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Maybe he'll show you.
L355533	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What is he?
L355532	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
L355531	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
L355530	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
L355529	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Why did you wait so long?
L355528	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
L355504	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	It was me.
L355503	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
L355585	u6364	m424	CULTISTS	He's with us... He's with us...
L355584	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	He's with us...
L355577	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Be ready.
L355576	u6364	m424	CULTISTS	Yes...
L355575	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Will you come to him on your knees?
L355574	u6364	m424	CULTISTS	Yes...
L355573	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Do you wish him to be amongst us?
L355234	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
L355233	u6372	m424	QUAID	Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
L354956	u6372	m424	QUAID	Yes.
L354955	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	And are you afraid?
L354954	u6372	m424	QUAID	Yes.
L354953	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
L354952	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
L354951	u6372	m424	QUAID	Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
L354950	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
L355695	u6367	m424	HARRY	Out!  Out!
L355694	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry-?
L355693	u6367	m424	HARRY	What the fuck?
L355691	u6367	m424	HARRY	I think so.
L355690	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Is it finished?
L355675	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm okay.  I'm okay.
L355674	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry?
L355670	u6367	m424	HARRY	I... have... to.
L355669	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Don't look.
L355667	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.
L355666	u6367	m424	HARRY	...yes?
L355665	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I'm here, Harry.
L355664	u6367	m424	HARRY	... oh... God...
L355661	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry...
L355660	u6367	m424	HARRY	No!  No!  No!
L355636	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
L355635	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You can't.
L355634	u6367	m424	HARRY	I've got to help him.
L355623	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hang on!
L355622	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh God!
L355435	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's all right.  It's not hurting...
L355434	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry?
L355430	u6367	m424	HARRY	Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
L355429	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Are you all right?
L355418	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's okay.
L355417	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What was that?
L355416	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
L355415	u6367	m424	HARRY	Quaid and Jennifer--
L355414	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.
L355413	u6367	m424	HARRY	And they all came...
L355412	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
L355411	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
L355410	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm sure.  He's dead.
L355409	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Are you sure?
L355408	u6367	m424	HARRY	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
L355407	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was so afraid.
L355406	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nothing you don't want.
L355405	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Nothing?
L355404	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nothing's going to happen to you.
L355403	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm here, aren't I?
L355402	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
L355401	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's okay.
L355399	u6367	m424	HARRY	He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
L355398	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
L355397	u6367	m424	HARRY	What then?
L355396	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I wasn't.
L355395	u6367	m424	HARRY	You said you weren't with him for love.
L355394	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No.
L355393	u6367	m424	HARRY	Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
L355392	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I told you --
L355391	u6367	m424	HARRY	So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
L355390	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Some or it.
L355389	u6367	m424	HARRY	He taught all this to Swann?
L355388	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
L355387	u6367	m424	HARRY	Stuff?
L355386	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
L355385	u6367	m424	HARRY	He was the real thing, right?
L355384	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	It was more than that, I think.
L355383	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
L355382	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why don't you tell me the truth?
L355381	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh Christ.
L355380	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
L355379	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What did you find?
L355378	u6367	m424	HARRY	I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
L355377	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
L355253	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  You do that.
L355252	u6367	m424	HARRY	Okay.  I'll keep digging.
L355251	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
L355250	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Jennifer Desiderio?
L355249	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
L355248	u6367	m424	HARRY	Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
L355247	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	That's my business. Harry.
L355246	u6367	m424	HARRY	So why did you marry him?
L355245	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't marry him for love.
L355244	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He... didn't have me..  I told you-
L355243	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why?  Because he had you?
L355242	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	They were jealous of him.
L355241	u6367	m424	HARRY	I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
L355240	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	How did it go today?
L355165	u6367	m424	HARRY	Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
L355164	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
L355163	u6367	m424	HARRY	I can be very persuasive.
L355162	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	They won't tell you anything.
L355161	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
L355160	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I don't know where you'd start.
L355159	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
L355158	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
L355157	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are they treating you okay?
L355120	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You haven't seen anything yet.
L355119	u6367	m424	HARRY	He's good.
L355090	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sure.
L355089	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
L355088	u6367	m424	HARRY	Do you?
L355087	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
L355086	u6367	m424	HARRY	When do you want me to start?
L355085	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
L355084	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm no bodyguard.
L355083	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry.
L355082	u6367	m424	HARRY	Harry.
L355081	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
L355080	u6367	m424	HARRY	Where do I sign?
L355079	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
L355078	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sorry.  You asked.
L355077	u6367	m424	HARRY	He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
L355076	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You don't believe me.
L355075	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
L355074	u6367	m424	HARRY	But obviously you still care what happens to him.
L355073	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
L355072	u6367	m424	HARRY	Does that mean...?
L355071	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
L355070	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you don't ask questions?
L355069	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He's a secretive man.
L355068	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why not?
L355067	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
L355066	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's the connection?
L355065	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I think we make our own futures.
L355064	u6367	m424	HARRY	You don't?
L355063	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
L355062	u6367	m424	HARRY	Did your husband know Quaid?
L355061	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
L355451	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
L355450	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What about me?
L355321	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I left three messages already.
L355320	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
L355319	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
L355318	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No word from D'Amour?
L355317	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
L355021	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You saw this?
L355020	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Good.  There.  Yes?
L355019	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Valentin?
L355017	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.  I'm not going near him.
L355016	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
L355015	u6373	m424	SWANN	I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
L355014	u6373	m424	SWANN	I just saw him.
L355013	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh God.
L355012	u6373	m424	SWANN	Somebody killed him.
L355011	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Sure.
L355010	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
L355009	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	... they believe you.
L355008	u6373	m424	SWANN	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
L355007	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Bad show last night?
L355156	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.  Not yet...
L355155	u6366	m424	EDDISON	For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
L355154	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you finished with me?
L355153	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Another fucking magician. Jesus.
L355152	u6367	m424	HARRY	--vanished.
L355151	u6366	m424	EDDISON	And this Butterfield guy--
L354983	u6366	m424	EDDISON	After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
L354982	u6367	m424	HARRY	He got up and walked.
L354981	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Where the fuck is he?
L354980	u6366	m424	EDDISON	New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
L354979	u6367	m424	HARRY	I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
L354978	u6366	m424	EDDISON	What makes you so sure?
L354977	u6367	m424	HARRY	Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
L354976	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
L354975	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
L354974	u6366	m424	EDDISON	What were you doing up there?
L355220	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Fuck you.
L355219	u6367	m424	HARRY	Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
L355217	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
L355216	u6367	m424	HARRY	With what?
L355215	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
L355214	u6367	m424	HARRY	Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
L355213	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
L355212	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'd like to hear them.
L355211	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Oh, I've got plenty.
L355210	u6367	m424	HARRY	You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
L355209	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	If he was so good why's he so dead?
L355208	u6367	m424	HARRY	I heard he was the best.
L355207	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	They weren't worth a damn.
L355206	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Swann's miracles?
L355205	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
L355204	u6367	m424	HARRY	So could you walk on water?
L355203	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
L355202	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
L355201	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Trickery and divinity.
L355200	u6367	m424	HARRY	Heaven and Hell?
L355199	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
L355198	u6367	m424	HARRY	You believe that?
L355566	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
L355565	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about?
L355564	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm sorry, D'Amour...
L355563	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
L355562	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Don't bother.
L355561	u6367	m424	HARRY	We've got to get you to a hospital.
L355560	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Him too.
L355554	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Help me.
L355553	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shit...
L355552	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	D'Amour --
L355449	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
L355448	u6367	m424	HARRY	I want to see Swann face to face.
L355447	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
L355446	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
L355445	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
L355444	u6367	m424	HARRY	Was that Swann's idea?
L355443	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I tried to pay you off.
L355442	u6367	m424	HARRY	And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
L355441	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.
L355440	u6367	m424	HARRY	You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
L355439	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.
L355438	u6367	m424	HARRY	You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
L355433	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355432	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you satisfied now?
L355375	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shut up!
L355374	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Leave her alone --
L355372	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You want more money, is that it?
L355371	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah, I know.
L355370	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I can't let you in.
L355315	u6367	m424	HARRY	When will she be in?
L355314	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm afraid she's not in.
L355313	u6367	m424	HARRY	I want to speak to Dorothea.
L355271	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355270	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
L355269	u6367	m424	HARRY	I like to know why things happen.
L355268	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	What for?  You need to stay busy?
L355267	u6367	m424	HARRY	Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
L355266	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.  It's regrettable
L355265	u6367	m424	HARRY	Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
L355264	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
L355263	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
L355262	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	A ticket home,
L355261	u6367	m424	HARRY	What for?
L355260	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
L355259	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why'd you come here?
L355258	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
L355257	u6367	m424	HARRY	What the fuck are you doing here?
L355060	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Swann's wife.
L355059	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is she?
L355057	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you a believer, then?
L355056	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you sure?
L355055	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I don't think the dead much care.
L355054	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
L355053	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Probably.
L355052	u6367	m424	HARRY	Any movie stars buried here?
L355051	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
L355050	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's the difference?
L355049	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
L355048	u6367	m424	HARRY	When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
L355047	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you a gambling man?
L355046	u6367	m424	HARRY	I saw him in Vegas once.
L355045	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You know of him?
L355044	u6367	m424	HARRY	Philip Swann?
L355043	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
L355042	u6367	m424	HARRY	Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
L355041	u6367	m424	HARRY	Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
L355040	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Maybe I just bought it.
L355039	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
L355038	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Mine.
L355037	u6367	m424	HARRY	Whose is the car?
L355035	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
L355034	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
L355033	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm here to offer you a job.
L355032	u6367	m424	HARRY	Then what do you want?
L355031	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	We've never met.
L355030	u6367	m424	HARRY	Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
L355029	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
L355028	u6367	m424	HARRY	What are you, my mother?
L355027	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	It's one in the afternoon.
L355026	u6367	m424	HARRY	Go away.
L355025	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Mr. D'Amour?
L355024	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shit.
L355283	u6367	m424	HARRY	And what does Jennifer think's real?
L355282	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
L355281	u6367	m424	HARRY	Does anybody?
L355280	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	She has no real grip on reality.
L355279	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's her problem?
L355278	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
L355277	u6367	m424	HARRY	I won't say anything.
L355276	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
L355275	u6367	m424	HARRY	A Mister Quaid?
L355274	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
L354972	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is he?
L354971	u6372	m424	QUAID	Yes...
L354970	u6367	m424	HARRY	The Puritan?
L354969	u6372	m424	QUAID	I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
L354968	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hold on.
L354967	u6372	m424	QUAID	You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
L354966	u6367	m424	HARRY	Not much.
L354965	u6372	m424	QUAID	You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
L354964	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah.  You could say that.
L354963	u6372	m424	QUAID	You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
L354962	u6367	m424	HARRY	What?
L354961	u6372	m424	QUAID	My God.
L354959	u6372	m424	QUAID	Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
L354958	u6367	m424	HARRY	You need an ambulance.
L355194	u6377	m424	WILDER	No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
L355193	u6367	m424	HARRY	Have you been in?
L355192	u6377	m424	WILDER	That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
L355191	u6377	m424	WILDER	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
L355190	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are they all in the business?
L355189	u6377	m424	WILDER	You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
L355188	u6367	m424	HARRY	I only wear ties for funerals.
L355186	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well... nobody.
L355185	u6377	m424	WILDER	For an introduction.
L355184	u6367	m424	HARRY	For what?
L355183	u6377	m424	WILDER	People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
L355182	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
L355181	u6377	m424	WILDER	He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
L355180	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sure.  Vivovich.
L355179	u6377	m424	WILDER	You know Vinovich?
L355176	u6367	m424	HARRY	Not the Walter Wilder?
L355175	u6377	m424	WILDER	You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
L355174	u6367	m424	HARRY	Was he taking a lot of risks?
L355173	u6377	m424	WILDER	What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
L355172	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
L355171	u6377	m424	WILDER	I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
L355170	u6367	m424	HARRY	Harry D'Amour.
L355169	u6377	m424	WILDER	At birth.  I don't know you --
L355168	u6367	m424	HARRY	That.
L355167	u6377	m424	WILDER	What?
L355166	u6367	m424	HARRY	Where'd you learn that?
L355685	u6367	m424	HARRY	Try.
L355684	u6373	m424	SWANN	I don't know.
L355683	u6367	m424	HARRY	Can you do it?
L355682	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes?
L355681	u6367	m424	HARRY	He did something with the ground.
L355606	u6373	m424	SWANN	I can't... I can't go any further...
L355605	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't try hard enough.
L355604	u6373	m424	SWANN	This is where we killed him.
L355591	u6367	m424	HARRY	Fuck.
L355590	u6373	m424	SWANN	At a guess... they just resurrected him.
L355589	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
L355572	u6367	m424	HARRY	In my time, and nobody else's.
L355571	u6373	m424	SWANN	That's where we're all going.
L355570	u6373	m424	SWANN	You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
L355569	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nobody's better off this wav!
L355568	u6373	m424	SWANN	He's better off this way.
L355567	u6367	m424	HARRY	... no...
L355549	u6373	m424	SWANN	Looks that way.
L355548	u6367	m424	HARRY	They got here before us.
L355527	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jesus!
L355526	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355525	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who else did?  Did Valentin?
L355524	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.
L355523	u6367	m424	HARRY	Did she know where Nix was buried?
L355518	u6373	m424	SWANN	I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
L355517	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you believed him?
L355516	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
L355515	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is that all?
L355514	u6373	m424	SWANN	He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
L355513	u6367	m424	HARRY	And he didn't have them?
L355512	u6373	m424	SWANN	Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
L355511	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you're not?
L355510	u6373	m424	SWANN	I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
L355509	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is that all?
L355508	u6373	m424	SWANN	I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
L355507	u6367	m424	HARRY	Didn't know you read minds.
L355506	u6373	m424	SWANN	You think I'm an asshole.
L355499	u6373	m424	SWANN	Will that do?  No?
L355498	u6367	m424	HARRY	Oh Jeez.
L355491	u6367	m424	HARRY	Help me.
L355490	u6373	m424	SWANN	I don't know what else to do.
L355489	u6367	m424	HARRY	And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
L355488	u6373	m424	SWANN	It's me betrayed him.
L355487	u6367	m424	HARRY	So Nix won't come looking for her?
L355486	u6373	m424	SWANN	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
L355485	u6367	m424	HARRY	Oh yeah?
L355484	u6373	m424	SWANN	I did it for Dorothea.
L355483	u6367	m424	HARRY	Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
L355482	u6373	m424	SWANN	He deserved it.
L355481	u6367	m424	HARRY	Or murdered, like Nix.
L355480	u6373	m424	SWANN	Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
L355479	u6367	m424	HARRY	You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
L355477	u6373	m424	SWANN	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
L355476	u6367	m424	HARRY	I don't think so.  You need me alive.
L355475	u6373	m424	SWANN	Now I'm going to have to kill you.
L355474	u6367	m424	HARRY	How the fuck do you do that?
L355473	u6373	m424	SWANN	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
L355472	u6367	m424	HARRY	Look, Ma, no wires.
L355471	u6373	m424	SWANN	They'll never find out.
L355470	u6367	m424	HARRY	A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
L355102	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Who is she?
L355101	u6367	m424	HARRY	What?
L355100	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	One question.
L355099	u6367	m424	HARRY	A couple of weeks.
L355098	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
L355097	u6367	m424	HARRY	There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
L355096	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Call me tomorrow.
L355095	u6367	m424	HARRY	I got to go.  I'm late.
L355094	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
L355093	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
L355092	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
L355307	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
L355306	u6367	m424	HARRY	And he's dead?
L355305	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Yes! Yes!
L355304	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is he the Puritan?
L355303	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Nix! Nix!
L355302	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who's not?
L355301	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	He's not!  He's not!
L355296	u6367	m424	HARRY	Swann?
L355295	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
L355294	u6367	m424	HARRY	What is?
L355293	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
L355292	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why's that?
L355291	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
L355290	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Philip Swann?
L355289	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Maybe... I... don't...
L355288	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
L355287	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
L355286	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355285	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Have we met before?
L355646	u6371	m424	NIX	Liar!
L355645	u6373	m424	SWANN	No!
L355644	u6371	m424	NIX	Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
L355643	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355642	u6371	m424	NIX	But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
L355641	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355640	u6371	m424	NIX	You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
L355633	u6371	m424	NIX	The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
L355632	u6373	m424	SWANN	Not true.
L355631	u6371	m424	NIX	Because you've got nothing else to live for.
L355630	u6373	m424	SWANN	Why would I want to?
L355629	u6371	m424	NIX	You could still help me do that.
L355628	u6371	m424	NIX	I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
L355627	u6373	m424	SWANN	And?
L354908	u6373	m424	SWANN	Binding you.
L354907	u6371	m424	NIX	Swann?  What are you doing?
L354898	u6371	m424	NIX	You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
L354897	u6373	m424	SWANN	Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
L354884	u6373	m424	SWANN	No!
L354883	u6371	m424	NIX	You don't think I've got it to give?
L354882	u6373	m424	SWANN	Fuck you.
L354881	u6371	m424	NIX	I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
L374319	u6528	m434	BOY	Let go of her.
L374318	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
L374316	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nothing's private...
L374315	u6528	m434	BOY	Look fella...this is private...
L374314	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
L374210	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
L374209	u6528	m434	BOY	Sounds good.
L374208	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
L374207	u6528	m434	BOY	Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
L374206	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What are your plans?
L374205	u6528	m434	BOY	Thanks.
L374204	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
L373956	u6528	m434	BOY	Follow me.
L373955	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Know where he is?
L373954	u6528	m434	BOY	Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
L373953	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
L374020	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
L374019	u6529	m434	BOY #1	Riverdale.

L374013	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I gotta get the stuff.
L374012	u6531	m434	BOYS	Why?
L374011	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.

L374373	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Thanks for the ride.
L374372	u6543	m434	TONY	Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
L374371	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I'll say that I'm travelling.
L374370	u6543	m434	TONY	And say what?
L374369	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
L374368	u6543	m434	TONY	How about Teresa?  I could talk...
L374367	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
L374366	u6543	m434	TONY	Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
L374365	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hey, come on...
L374364	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L374363	u6543	m434	TONY	You flew before?
L374362	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah.
L374361	u6543	m434	TONY	Nervous?
L374360	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
L374359	u6543	m434	TONY	So?
L374358	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
L374357	u6543	m434	TONY	I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
L374356	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Kennedy.
L374355	u6543	m434	TONY	Where to?
L374338	u6543	m434	TONY	Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
L374337	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
L374336	u6543	m434	TONY	Get out of here before this really goes up.
L374304	u6543	m434	TONY	Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
L374303	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	She don't look Jewish.
L374302	u6543	m434	TONY	Look at her.
L374301	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How do you know?
L374300	u6543	m434	TONY	Jewish...
L374299	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Who's the girl?
L374054	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
L374053	u6543	m434	TONY	Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
L374051	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
L374050	u6543	m434	TONY	'Thou art then a king?'
L374049	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
L374047	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
L374046	u6543	m434	TONY	'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
L374045	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Salute!!!
L374044	u6543	m434	TONY	'And with your spirit.'
L374043	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	May God be with you.
L373766	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Anybody wanna have a game?
L373765	u6543	m434	TONY	No.
L373755	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
L373754	u6543	m434	TONY	You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
L373753	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
L373746	u6543	m434	TONY	'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
L373745	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
L373742	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Be careful.
L373741	u6543	m434	TONY	Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
L373740	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
L373739	u6543	m434	TONY	Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
L374200	u6535	m434	JIMMY	Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
L374199	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You got some mouth!
L374165	u6535	m434	JIMMY	I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
L374164	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
L374163	u6535	m434	JIMMY	The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
L374162	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Next time, bet with your own kind.
L373761	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not quite...but keep trying.
L373760	u6535	m434	JIMMY	Waddaya think?
L374344	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Good idea.
L374343	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What are you going to do?  Hide me?
L374342	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Forget it.
L374341	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
L374340	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L374339	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I think we should see your uncle.
L374324	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
L374323	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
L374296	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Mind your own business.
L374295	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Back so soon.
L374289	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'll be here.  Don't worry.
L374288	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't you move!!!
L374285	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Come on.
L374284	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
L374283	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
L374282	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
L374281	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh, cut it out, will ya?
L374280	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	No you're not...
L374279	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
L374274	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
L374273	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
L374262	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
L374261	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
L374257	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
L374256	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't be smart.
L374255	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
L374254	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
L374253	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
L374251	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
L374250	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Shut up!
L374184	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	You tell me that in front of these creeps?
L374183	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Keep your mouth shut.
L374099	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I understand.
L374098	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
L374097	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
L374096	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
L374095	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
L374094	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
L374093	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How?
L374092	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
L374091	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
L374090	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
L374089	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
L374088	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
L374087	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's not going to help.
L374086	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
L374085	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Did you see them run!
L374084	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Let's get out of here.
L374081	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
L374080	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
L374077	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
L374076	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Don't come any closer!!!
L373829	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
L373828	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I could have told you that.
L373827	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hey...you got nothing here.
L373825	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Listen...I'm a guest here.
L373824	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
L373823	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
L373822	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't promise...just deliver.
L373821	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
L373820	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
L373819	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
L373818	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
L373817	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I don't like loading crates.
L373816	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
L373815	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Didn't show up.
L373814	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What do you mean?
L373813	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	There won't be any this week.
L373812	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
L373811	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Don't worry.  I can handle it.
L373810	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
L373809	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Wouldn't bother me.
L373808	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
L373805	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, she isn't.
L373804	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
L373775	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Should I slap him?
L373774	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
L373764	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
L373763	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Nah.
L373731	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
L373730	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	It's the truth, I swear.
L373712	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
L373711	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I know but let's hear it anyway.
L373710	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
L373709	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What happened to you Flash?
L373698	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Giovanino!  Where have you been?
L373697	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Drinks for everybody Tony...
L373889	u6540	m434	OSCAR	What can I say?
L373888	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
L373887	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
L373886	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't understand, where's Groppi?
L373885	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
L373884	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
L373883	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
L373882	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
L373881	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
L373880	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That bad, huh?
L373879	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
L373878	u6540	m434	OSCAR	What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
L373877	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What pipes?
L373876	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
L373875	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L373874	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
L373873	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok, how's everything going?
L373872	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
L374332	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
L374331	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're really crazy.
L374327	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, where's the rest?
L374326	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Where's the rest?
L374240	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Whatever.
L374239	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
L374234	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	We'll be here.
L374233	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
L374068	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You said it.
L374067	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
L374066	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
L374065	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
L374064	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.

L374062	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Charlie, this is business.
L374061	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
L374060	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
L374059	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How much was the original loan again?
L374058	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
L374057	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
L374056	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.

L374030	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How much?
L374029	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
L374028	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What's a'matter?
L373982	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	We'll settle it tonight.
L373981	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
L373980	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
L373979	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
L373978	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh Michael, look...

L373797	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok...that's it.
L373796	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Disgraceful.

L373791	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Hey, shut up.
L373769	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	OK, get in.
L373768	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, give us a lift.
L373695	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	OK.
L373694	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
L373693	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
L373692	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
L373691	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
L373690	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
L373689	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
L373688	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
L373687	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
L373686	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
L373685	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nope...
L373684	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
L373683	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...I'll be ok for a week.
L373682	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
L373681	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	OK, ok...
L373680	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
L373679	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh great...hey - Winstons?
L374232	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Bye.
L374231	u6533	m434	DIANE	Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
L374230	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
L374229	u6533	m434	DIANE	Chinese food?
L374228	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
L374227	u6533	m434	DIANE	Hostess?
L374226	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...no stripping...as the hostess.
L374225	u6533	m434	DIANE	Stripper?
L374224	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
L374223	u6533	m434	DIANE	That's nice.
L374222	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
L374221	u6533	m434	DIANE	I know.
L374220	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, I'm serious...You're really good.
L374219	u6533	m434	DIANE	Fine.
L374218	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
L374217	u6533	m434	DIANE	Fine.
L374216	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Diane, how are you feeling?
L374152	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
L374151	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Well, maybe you missed something?
L374148	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	All right.
L374147	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	"Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm ""cumpari"" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved."
L374146	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What do they expect you to say?
L374145	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
L374144	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
L374143	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, she's got epilepsy.
L374142	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
L374141	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Teresa.
L374140	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
L374135	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What did he do?
L374134	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
L374129	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
L374128	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh yes, he's pretty good.
L374116	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
L374115	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
L374114	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
L374113	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
L373968	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
L373967	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
L373966	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
L373965	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh...around...why?
L373964	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Hey, where you been?
L373963	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok.
L373962	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Take a drink!
L373913	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
L373912	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
L373911	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Yes, you did.
L373910	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
L373909	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	No you weren't.
L373908	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	About that shooting last night...I was there and...
L373907	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
L373906	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Uncle, how are you feeling?
L374150	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
L374149	u6538	m434	MARIO	Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
L374131	u6538	m434	MARIO	Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
L374130	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
L374124	u6538	m434	MARIO	Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
L374123	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.
L374122	u6538	m434	MARIO	Wha?
L374121	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Francis Macomber.
L374120	u6538	m434	MARIO	No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
L374119	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nothing.
L374118	u6538	m434	MARIO	What was it?
L374117	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Wasn't a book...was a short story.
L374242	u6542	m434	TERESA	For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
L374241	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
L374214	u6542	m434	TERESA	But...
L374213	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
L374212	u6542	m434	TERESA	Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
L374211	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
L374073	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
L374072	u6542	m434	TERESA	The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
L373947	u6542	m434	TERESA	The green capsules in the top drawer.
L373946	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
L373945	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'm sleepy.
L373944	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
L373943	u6542	m434	TERESA	Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
L373942	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
L373938	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I know...I know.
L373937	u6542	m434	TERESA	I can take care of myself.  You know that.
L373936	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well you can't blame them in a way.
L373935	u6542	m434	TERESA	You know why...with my parents.
L373934	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
L373933	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
L373931	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Watch your language.
L373930	u6542	m434	TERESA	You're intolerable today.
L373929	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That W.A.S.P. bastard.
L373928	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
L373927	u6542	m434	TERESA	Sure...He lives there?
L373926	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
L373924	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's the word...preoccupied.
L373923	u6542	m434	TERESA	I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
L373922	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Take your time.  I don't care.
L373921	u6542	m434	TERESA	It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
L373920	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
L373919	u6542	m434	TERESA	A paper on that one too?
L373918	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Bore.
L373917	u6542	m434	TERESA	Ok.
L373916	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
L373915	u6542	m434	TERESA	C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
L373862	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
L373861	u6542	m434	TERESA	It's still sick.
L373860	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
L373859	u6542	m434	TERESA	It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
L373858	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
L373857	u6542	m434	TERESA	No.
L373856	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Did you?
L373855	u6542	m434	TERESA	Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
L373854	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't ask.
L373853	u6542	m434	TERESA	What is it now?
L373852	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
L373851	u6542	m434	TERESA	Anything specific?
L373850	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
L373849	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nobody knows anything, believe me.
L373848	u6542	m434	TERESA	Charlie...?
L373847	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Maybe, who knows.
L373846	u6542	m434	TERESA	An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
L373845	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
L373844	u6542	m434	TERESA	It's all right.
L373843	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Sure...it's not that...I mean...
L373842	u6542	m434	TERESA	I don't mind.
L373841	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well...
L373840	u6542	m434	TERESA	Please take it.
L373839	u6542	m434	TERESA	Here.
L373838	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
L373837	u6542	m434	TERESA	Do you have enough?
L373836	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok, we'll go for lunch.
L373835	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
L374196	u6536	m434	JOEY	Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
L374195	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Count it.
L374194	u6536	m434	JOEY	Don't count it...it's all there.

L373779	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Friends of yours Michael.
L373778	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Just keep him quiet.
L373706	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You what?
L373705	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
L373704	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
L373703	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
L374034	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
L374033	u6543	m434	TONY	Yeah.
L374026	u6543	m434	TONY	Thanks.
L374025	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Sure.
L374024	u6543	m434	TONY	Can you spare it?
L374023	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
L374022	u6543	m434	TONY	How much?
L376243	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
L376242	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Dinner?  Again?
L376234	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Yeah, speak for yourself.
L376233	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Look who's talking.
L376182	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You think so?
L376181	u6544	m435	ALLISON	-- But he does seem very nice.
L376179	u6544	m435	ALLISON	...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
L376178	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
L376177	u6544	m435	ALLISON	...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
L375870	u6544	m435	ALLISON	And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
L375869	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's your name?
L375862	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
L375861	u6544	m435	ALLISON	You ate?
L375860	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
L375522	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
L375521	u6544	m435	ALLISON	I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
L376271	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
L376270	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
L375894	u6548	m435	DREW	Very.
L375893	u6544	m435	ALLISON	He's cute.
L375892	u6548	m435	DREW	That was 'Joe'.
L375828	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Love that name.
L375827	u6548	m435	DREW	Just plain 'Joe'?
L375823	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
L375822	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Daddy!  Come on, a name.
L375740	u6548	m435	DREW	Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
L375739	u6544	m435	ALLISON	His wife?
L375738	u6548	m435	DREW	He's coming.
L375737	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Did you speak to the Governor?
L376615	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Yes, it is.
L376614	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
L376612	u6544	m435	ALLISON	"But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, ""What does she want now?"""
L376611	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I wasn't going to say --
L376610	u6544	m435	ALLISON	That you've been to Susan?
L376609	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I haven't been the father to you that --
L376608	u6544	m435	ALLISON	They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
L376607	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
L376606	u6544	m435	ALLISON	I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
L376604	u6544	m435	ALLISON	-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
L376603	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do they, m'dear?
L376602	u6544	m435	ALLISON	The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
L376601	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
L376600	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
L376355	u6544	m435	ALLISON	'Goddam party'!
L376354	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh, the goddam party --
L376353	u6544	m435	ALLISON	It's for the party, Dad --
L376352	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't like cake.
L376351	u6544	m435	ALLISON	From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
L376350	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Who's Annie?
L376349	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Annie made them.
L376348	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is this?
L376200	u6544	m435	ALLISON	That's okay, Daddy.
L376199	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
L376198	u6544	m435	ALLISON	You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
L376197	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Of course.
L376196	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
L376195	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
L376194	u6544	m435	ALLISON	From the Korean War.
L376193	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Who?
L376192	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
L375882	u6552	m435	PARRISH	We've got some things to discuss.
L375881	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
L375836	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
L375835	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- Black.
L375819	u6552	m435	PARRISH	A name?
L375818	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
L375730	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
L375729	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
L375728	u6544	m435	ALLISON	And you could care less --
L375727	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know you do, darling.
L375726	u6544	m435	ALLISON	I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
L375725	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What, honey?
L375529	u6544	m435	ALLISON	No.
L375528	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
L375527	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
L375526	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I hate parties --
L375518	u6544	m435	ALLISON	But it's your birthday.
L375517	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
L375516	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
L375515	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
L375514	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Have you got a minute?
L375513	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hi, Allison --
L375512	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Daddy!
L376364	u6544	m435	ALLISON	What will I tell Annie?
L376363	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But what?
L376362	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Yeah, but --
L375845	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You know what I'm saying, Joe?
L375844	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Honey --!
L375843	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
L375842	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Paillarde of veal.
L375749	u6553	m435	QUINCE	No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
L375748	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
L375746	u6553	m435	QUINCE	He said he would be there with bells on.
L375745	u6544	m435	ALLISON	What about the Mayor?
L375567	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
L375566	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
L375565	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Honey, please.
L376620	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Both.
L376619	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	Red or white?
L376618	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
L376617	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
L375545	u6553	m435	QUINCE	9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
L375544	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
L375543	u6553	m435	QUINCE	What do you do that for?
L375542	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
L375541	u6553	m435	QUINCE	And that?
L375540	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
L375539	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...This shit's not bad.
L375640	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
L375639	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I thought you were buying my company.
L375638	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
L375637	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry, I don't recall --
L375636	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
L375635	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
L375634	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
L376251	u6547	m435	COYLE	Right away.
L376250	u6551	m435	JOE	Toast?  No...just the butter.
L376249	u6547	m435	COYLE	How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
L376248	u6551	m435	JOE	I would prefer some peanut butter.
L375934	u6547	m435	COYLE	I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
L375933	u6551	m435	JOE	'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
L375932	u6547	m435	COYLE	You mean this, sir?
L375931	u6551	m435	JOE	What are you eating.
L375930	u6547	m435	COYLE	Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
L375929	u6551	m435	JOE	Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
L375928	u6547	m435	COYLE	Yes, sir?
L376397	u6548	m435	DREW	So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
L376396	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
L376395	u6548	m435	DREW	Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
L376299	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah.  Goodnight.
L376298	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Well... goodnight.
L376297	u6548	m435	DREW	No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
L376296	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
L376295	u6548	m435	DREW	That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
L376294	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew, you're out of line.
L376293	u6548	m435	DREW	Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
L376292	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
L376291	u6548	m435	DREW	Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
L376290	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...See you tomorrow night.
L375884	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What 'business'?
L375883	u6548	m435	DREW	-- Did I hear 'business'?
L375548	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Hi.
L375547	u6548	m435	DREW	Hello, Beautiful.
L376446	u6554	m435	SLOANE	He'll wait --
L376445	u6548	m435	DREW	Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
L376444	u6554	m435	SLOANE	We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
L376337	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Hello, Quince.
L376336	u6548	m435	DREW	Thank you for coming.
L376334	u6548	m435	DREW	Am I not obligated to?
L376333	u6554	m435	SLOANE	You're taking this too far, Drew.
L376332	u6548	m435	DREW	Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
L376331	u6554	m435	SLOANE	And what would that be?
L376770	u6548	m435	DREW	The dagger --?
L376769	u6551	m435	JOE	I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
L376768	u6548	m435	DREW	I'm not stepping anywhere --
L376764	u6551	m435	JOE	-- And now you're going to pee some more.
L376763	u6548	m435	DREW	So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
L376392	u6548	m435	DREW	Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
L376391	u6551	m435	JOE	No, I don't --
L376273	u6548	m435	DREW	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
L376272	u6551	m435	JOE	Perhaps you could remind me.
L376268	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
L376267	u6548	m435	DREW	Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
L376266	u6551	m435	JOE	But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
L376265	u6548	m435	DREW	Who are we talking about?
L376231	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
L376230	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376155	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376154	u6548	m435	DREW	May I interrupting?
L376054	u6551	m435	JOE	Then why did you bring it up?
L376053	u6548	m435	DREW	It doesn't matter.
L376052	u6551	m435	JOE	Of whom?
L376051	u6548	m435	DREW	It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
L376050	u6551	m435	JOE	What an odd pairing.
L376049	u6548	m435	DREW	Yes.
L376048	u6551	m435	JOE	Death and Taxes?
L376047	u6548	m435	DREW	Yes.
L376038	u6548	m435	DREW	And a glass.
L376037	u6551	m435	JOE	Cold.
L376036	u6548	m435	DREW	Hot or cold.
L376035	u6551	m435	JOE	Why yes, thank you.
L376034	u6548	m435	DREW	Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
L376033	u6551	m435	JOE	Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
L376032	u6548	m435	DREW	The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
L376031	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you.
L376030	u6548	m435	DREW	Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
L375873	u6548	m435	DREW	'Here'?
L375872	u6551	m435	JOE	Here...
L375871	u6548	m435	DREW	Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
L375858	u6548	m435	DREW	Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
L375857	u6551	m435	JOE	I didn't say.
L375856	u6548	m435	DREW	What side of the industry did you say you were on?
L375855	u6551	m435	JOE	We have an arrangement now.
L376788	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
L376787	u6548	m435	DREW	You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
L376786	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You get not to go to jail.
L376785	u6548	m435	DREW	And what do I get?
L376784	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
L376783	u6548	m435	DREW	I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
L376761	u6548	m435	DREW	Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
L376760	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
L376759	u6548	m435	DREW	I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
L376452	u6548	m435	DREW	Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
L376451	u6552	m435	PARRISH	In English, please.
L376450	u6548	m435	DREW	But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
L376449	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
L376443	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Are you running this Board or am I?
L376442	u6548	m435	DREW	Certainly, Bill.
L376441	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
L376440	u6548	m435	DREW	So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
L376439	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
L376438	u6548	m435	DREW	Don't you want to hear the details?
L376437	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The answer is no, quick enough for you?
L376436	u6548	m435	DREW	Bontecou wants a quick response and --
L376435	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's it?
L376433	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't think so.  Do you?
L376432	u6548	m435	DREW	Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
L376388	u6548	m435	DREW	Certainly.  Goodnight.
L376387	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I think it's time you went home, Drew.
L376386	u6548	m435	DREW	I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
L376385	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
L376384	u6548	m435	DREW	Yours.
L376383	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Whose?
L376382	u6548	m435	DREW	With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
L376381	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't care.
L376380	u6548	m435	DREW	What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
L376379	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Over my dead body.
L376378	u6548	m435	DREW	If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
L376377	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What are their feelings?
L376376	u6548	m435	DREW	Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
L376375	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
L376279	u6548	m435	DREW	Sure.
L376278	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
L376277	u6548	m435	DREW	I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
L376259	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Please, Drew.
L376258	u6548	m435	DREW	Mind if I throw up?
L376226	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
L376225	u6548	m435	DREW	For how long?  And why?
L376224	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
L376223	u6548	m435	DREW	As much as Joe's?
L376222	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
L376167	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
L376166	u6548	m435	DREW	I thought this was practically a done deal --
L376165	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
L376163	u6548	m435	DREW	I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
L376162	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Why?
L376161	u6548	m435	DREW	How nice for you both.
L376160	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
L376159	u6548	m435	DREW	Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
L376158	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sit down, Drew.
L376157	u6548	m435	DREW	'Just kidding'?
L376156	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No.
L376059	u6548	m435	DREW	But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
L376058	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Shall we adjourn?
L376057	u6548	m435	DREW	Glad I could be of some help.
L376056	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I am now.
L376055	u6548	m435	DREW	"You're not familiar with the phrase, ""In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes""?"
L376045	u6548	m435	DREW	That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
L376044	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
L376043	u6548	m435	DREW	...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
L375854	u6548	m435	DREW	I get the feeling you've done some business before.
L375853	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No --
L375849	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Uh -- he's from out of town --
L375848	u6548	m435	DREW	Have we met?
L375834	u6548	m435	DREW	Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
L375833	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What do you mean?
L375832	u6548	m435	DREW	Is there any more to it?
L375831	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes.
L375830	u6548	m435	DREW	'Joe...'
L375825	u6548	m435	DREW	What?!
L375824	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
L375821	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
L375820	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah, something he goes by --
L375679	u6548	m435	DREW	Olympic.
L375678	u6552	m435	PARRISH	As close as a deal could be.
L375677	u6548	m435	DREW	So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
L375674	u6548	m435	DREW	You have a way with words.
L375673	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Like a marriage made in heaven?
L375672	u6548	m435	DREW	I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
L375671	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Me, too.
L375670	u6548	m435	DREW	I'm all excited --
L375633	u6548	m435	DREW	That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
L375632	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
L375630	u6548	m435	DREW	Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
L375629	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do you think I need a haircut?
L375628	u6548	m435	DREW	It's going to be great --
L375627	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sounds good.
L375626	u6548	m435	DREW	...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
L375615	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No no, not you.
L375614	u6548	m435	DREW	Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
L375613	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Did you just hear something?
L375612	u6548	m435	DREW	I was saying to Quince we won't need --
L375557	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
L375556	u6548	m435	DREW	'Yes' to the deal?
L375555	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Yes'.
L375554	u6548	m435	DREW	What'd it say?
L375553	u6552	m435	PARRISH	In my sleep.
L375552	u6548	m435	DREW	A voice?
L375551	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
L375550	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
L375549	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
L376753	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
L376752	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
L376751	u6548	m435	DREW	He said that?
L376750	u6553	m435	QUINCE	He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
L376749	u6548	m435	DREW	This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
L376469	u6548	m435	DREW	Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
L376468	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
L376467	u6548	m435	DREW	The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
L376466	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But I didn't mean to do it!
L376465	u6548	m435	DREW	Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
L376464	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I'm going to put a stop to this!
L376463	u6548	m435	DREW	That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
L376462	u6553	m435	QUINCE	What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
L376347	u6553	m435	QUINCE	That's what he said.
L376346	u6548	m435	DREW	'It's up to Joe'?
L376345	u6553	m435	QUINCE	The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
L376344	u6548	m435	DREW	-- But he was concerned about the timing?
L376343	u6553	m435	QUINCE	He was interested.
L376342	u6548	m435	DREW	How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
L376341	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
L376275	u6548	m435	DREW	You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
L376274	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
L376212	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah.  Neat.
L376211	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
L376210	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, that's very interesting.
L376209	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah, that's what he said.
L376208	u6548	m435	DREW	'It's up to Joe', huh?
L376207	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah.
L376206	u6548	m435	DREW	'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
L376205	u6553	m435	QUINCE	We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
L376204	u6548	m435	DREW	Are you?
L376203	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
L376202	u6548	m435	DREW	Thanks, Quince.
L376201	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
L375868	u6548	m435	DREW	Joe, you do get around.
L375867	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Well, I guess he's found one.
L375755	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
L375754	u6548	m435	DREW	You're overthinking it --
L375609	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I know.  Gum up the works.
L375608	u6548	m435	DREW	Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
L375607	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
L376551	u6551	m435	JOE	Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
L376550	u6549	m435	EASTER	Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
L376549	u6551	m435	JOE	Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
L376548	u6549	m435	EASTER	Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
L376547	u6551	m435	JOE	Don' need you okayin'.
L376546	u6549	m435	EASTER	Rass!
L376545	u6551	m435	JOE	She knows how she feel.
L376544	u6549	m435	EASTER	She knows you real self?
L376543	u6551	m435	JOE	I am.
L376542	u6549	m435	EASTER	You loved back?
L376541	u6551	m435	JOE	Yah.
L376539	u6551	m435	JOE	Mine, too.
L376538	u6549	m435	EASTER	My Doctor Lady?
L376537	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376536	u6549	m435	EASTER	Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
L376535	u6551	m435	JOE	Nuthin'.
L376534	u6549	m435	EASTER	Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
L376533	u6551	m435	JOE	No, I come to see Doctor.

L376107	u6549	m435	EASTER	Obeah.
L376430	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Didn't you call a Board meeting?
L376429	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What?
L376428	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	The Board is waiting.
L376427	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning, Jennifer.
L376426	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
L376024	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
L376023	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Jennifer.
L376022	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Didn't the family get together last night --?
L376021	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
L375707	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Nothing?
L375706	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No.  Nothing.
L375705	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
L375704	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sure.
L375703	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
L375676	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hi, Jennifer.
L375675	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
L376645	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376644	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
L376641	u6551	m435	JOE	Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
L376640	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You think so?  How do you know?
L376638	u6553	m435	QUINCE	What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
L376637	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
L376636	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.
L376635	u6551	m435	JOE	What do you mean 'free'?
L376634	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
L376633	u6551	m435	JOE	'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
L376632	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
L376631	u6551	m435	JOE	But she loves you?
L376630	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
L376629	u6551	m435	JOE	How did you meet?
L376628	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Oh yes, I do.
L376627	u6551	m435	JOE	You love Allison, don't you?
L376626	u6553	m435	QUINCE	'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
L376625	u6551	m435	JOE	Love.
L376624	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Confused, huh?  About what?
L376623	u6551	m435	JOE	Do I?  I'm a little confused.
L376622	u6553	m435	QUINCE	C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
L376373	u6551	m435	JOE	You're welcome.
L376372	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Thanks.
L376371	u6551	m435	JOE	And you're a nice man, Quince.
L376370	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
L376369	u6551	m435	JOE	On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
L376368	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I didn't know that.
L376367	u6551	m435	JOE	Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
L376191	u6553	m435	QUINCE	No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
L376190	u6551	m435	JOE	That's very gracious of you, Quince.
L375886	u6551	m435	JOE	It's so very nice to see you again.
L375885	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Don't bother asking, we already tried.
L375879	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Hey, this is fun.
L375878	u6551	m435	JOE	Black.
L375851	u6551	m435	JOE	As long as it takes.
L375850	u6553	m435	QUINCE	How long you here, Joe?
L375840	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you?
L375839	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
L375838	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes?
L375837	u6553	m435	QUINCE	'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
L376844	u6551	m435	JOE	Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
L376843	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You think so?
L376842	u6551	m435	JOE	Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
L376841	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's it?
L376738	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you for loving me.
L376737	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- Yes?
L376736	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan --
L376735	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Hold me --
L376734	u6551	m435	JOE	I love you now, I'll love you always --
L376733	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
L376732	u6555	m435	SUSAN	But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
L376731	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm still here.
L376726	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
L376725	u6551	m435	JOE	I - uh --
L376724	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
L376723	u6551	m435	JOE	The 'coffee shop' --
L376722	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
L376721	u6551	m435	JOE	Did I say that?
L376668	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes, that's why I said it.
L376667	u6551	m435	JOE	I believe that, don't you?
L376666	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It's a saying.
L376665	u6551	m435	JOE	'Love will find out the way'?
L376664	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'Love will find out the way'.
L376663	u6551	m435	JOE	What will we do?
L376662	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
L376661	u6551	m435	JOE	Will it?
L376660	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Don't.  That will come later.
L376659	u6551	m435	JOE	But there's so much to tell you --
L376658	u6555	m435	SUSAN	We know all that we need to know --
L376657	u6551	m435	JOE	We know so little about each other --
L376656	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Then don't.
L376655	u6551	m435	JOE	No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
L376654	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It gets worse.
L376653	u6551	m435	JOE	I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
L376652	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And you can't tell me who you are.
L376651	u6551	m435	JOE	Well -- I --
L376650	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where are you going?
L376649	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
L376648	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
L376647	u6551	m435	JOE	I love you in an evening gown.
L376646	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I like you in a black tie.
L376499	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh, I hope a long, long time.
L376498	u6555	m435	SUSAN	For how long?
L376497	u6551	m435	JOE	Nowhere?  I'm...here.
L376496	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where are you going?
L376495	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes!
L376494	u6555	m435	SUSAN	More than you love peanut butter?
L376493	u6551	m435	JOE	I loved it.
L376492	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Did you like making love to me?
L376489	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Maybe it's the draft through the door.
L376488	u6551	m435	JOE	...No.
L376486	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
L376485	u6555	m435	SUSAN	He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
L376484	u6551	m435	JOE	He's taking a nap.
L376482	u6551	m435	JOE	How beautiful.
L376481	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
L376480	u6551	m435	JOE	I am.
L376479	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're here?
L376418	u6551	m435	JOE	Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
L376417	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And is your heart beating strangely?
L376416	u6551	m435	JOE	Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
L376415	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I don't know who you are.
L376414	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes?
L376410	u6551	m435	JOE	Why, yes.  Thank you.
L376409	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
L376408	u6551	m435	JOE	-- Could you?
L376407	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It was everything.
L376406	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you.
L376405	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- I guess you haven't.
L376404	u6551	m435	JOE	I love your smell.
L376402	u6551	m435	JOE	Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
L376401	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry about --
L376399	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I said get out.
L376398	u6551	m435	JOE	Almost.
L376394	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why don't you get off his case?
L376393	u6551	m435	JOE	You first.
L376315	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.  I'm tired.
L376314	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'To bed'?
L376313	u6551	m435	JOE	To bed.
L376312	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where are you going?
L376309	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376308	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Gay?
L376307	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376306	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Girlfriend?
L376305	u6551	m435	JOE	No, I'm not.
L376304	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
L376303	u6551	m435	JOE	Why?
L376301	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
L376300	u6555	m435	SUSAN	How long have you been standing there?
L376264	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry to hear that.
L376263	u6555	m435	SUSAN	We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
L376262	u6551	m435	JOE	Has her pain abated?
L376261	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I am, too.
L376260	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
L376257	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes...I've found that it does.
L376256	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It comforts you, doesn't it?
L376255	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes...
L376254	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
L376253	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't know.
L376252	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why do you love peanut butter so much?
L376220	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And I appreciate you, too.
L376219	u6551	m435	JOE	I mean I appreciate that.
L376218	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Excuse me?
L376217	u6551	m435	JOE	I appreciate you --
L376216	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
L376215	u6551	m435	JOE	Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
L376214	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
L376213	u6551	m435	JOE	I wanted to apologize, Susan --
L376137	u6551	m435	JOE	Be sorry for nothing.
L376136	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
L376135	u6551	m435	JOE	Not now.
L376134	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Joe, I'm with Drew.
L376128	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes.
L376127	u6551	m435	JOE	She's in a great deal of pain.
L376093	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't mind --
L376092	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Patients have visitors, not doctors.
L376091	u6551	m435	JOE	And I'll be a visitor.
L376090	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
L376089	u6551	m435	JOE	Whatever you do.
L376088	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Watch me do what?
L376087	u6551	m435	JOE	Very well, I'll watch.
L376086	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
L376085	u6551	m435	JOE	I came to see you.
L376084	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Then why are you here, Joe?
L376083	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh goodness, no.
L376081	u6551	m435	JOE	How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
L376080	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Joe --
L375972	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
L375971	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes?
L375969	u6551	m435	JOE	Goodnight to you, Susan.
L375968	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Goodnight, Joe.
L375967	u6551	m435	JOE	Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
L375966	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes?
L375965	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan?
L375964	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
L375963	u6551	m435	JOE	I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
L375962	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes --?
L375960	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I can see why.
L375959	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't have any.
L375958	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I've got plenty of friends.
L375957	u6551	m435	JOE	I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
L375956	u6555	m435	SUSAN	No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
L375955	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
L375954	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
L375953	u6551	m435	JOE	When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
L375952	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Come again?
L375951	u6551	m435	JOE	Do you love Drew?
L375950	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- What kind of childhood did you have?
L375949	u6551	m435	JOE	I haven't.
L375948	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You act like you never had peanut butter before --
L375947	u6551	m435	JOE	Peanut butter.
L375946	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
L375945	u6551	m435	JOE	That is not my intention.
L375944	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
L375943	u6551	m435	JOE	I am Joe.
L375942	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
L375941	u6551	m435	JOE	'Big'?
L375939	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry.
L375938	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- Can't seem to escape you today.
L375937	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm lost.
L375936	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What are you doing here?
L376834	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's life.  What can I tell you?
L376833	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376829	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376828	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I guess you have your reasons.
L376827	u6551	m435	JOE	Not exactly.
L376826	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank you.
L376825	u6551	m435	JOE	Happy Birthday, Bill.
L376782	u6551	m435	JOE	An indictable offense.
L376781	u6552	m435	PARRISH	An offense --
L376780	u6551	m435	JOE	Undisclosed conflict of interest --
L376779	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
L376778	u6551	m435	JOE	And we're very grateful.
L376777	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
L376775	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- An IRS man.
L376774	u6551	m435	JOE	I'll take it from here --  I am --
L376773	u6552	m435	PARRISH	He is --
L376772	u6551	m435	JOE	Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
L376771	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I told you to shut up.
L376767	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
L376766	u6551	m435	JOE	It's time to put this person where he belongs.
L376765	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, don't do this --
L376746	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Get him in here.
L376745	u6551	m435	JOE	Okay.
L376715	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
L376714	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you threatening me?
L376713	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't expect you to.
L376712	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't like what you're saying.
L376711	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Does she know where she's going?
L376710	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376709	u6552	m435	PARRISH	With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
L376708	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
L376707	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, they're mine now.
L376706	u6551	m435	JOE	Those were my words, Bill.
L376705	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L376704	u6551	m435	JOE	So that's what love is?
L376703	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
L376702	u6551	m435	JOE	Which is what?
L376701	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
L376700	u6551	m435	JOE	Then what is it?
L376699	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
L376698	u6551	m435	JOE	I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
L376697	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
L376696	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry, Bill --
L376695	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
L376694	u6551	m435	JOE	I think you heard me, Bill.
L376693	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're what?
L376692	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
L376691	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Say again?
L376690	u6551	m435	JOE	-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
L376689	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
L376688	u6551	m435	JOE	I was just asking, Bill.
L376687	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What the hell do you care?
L376686	u6551	m435	JOE	Not at all.
L376685	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thanks.
L376588	u6551	m435	JOE	Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
L376587	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yeah.
L376586	u6551	m435	JOE	You are?
L376585	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What are you saying, that it's time to go?
L376584	u6551	m435	JOE	-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
L376583	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes?
L376582	u6551	m435	JOE	Uh --
L376525	u6551	m435	JOE	I told you, 'watch it'.
L376524	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
L376523	u6551	m435	JOE	May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
L376522	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And I don't give a shit.
L376521	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
L376520	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
L376519	u6551	m435	JOE	This universe?
L376518	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're violating the laws of the universe.
L376515	u6551	m435	JOE	I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
L376514	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
L376513	u6551	m435	JOE	'Spooning'?
L376512	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
L376511	u6551	m435	JOE	With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
L376510	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm her father!
L376509	u6551	m435	JOE	I'll be the judge of that.
L376508	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
L376507	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes, I saw you see me.
L376505	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry to hear that.
L376504	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I couldn't sleep.
L376478	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Then I can't help you.
L376477	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm not hungry.
L376476	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
L376475	u6551	m435	JOE	'Fish'?
L376474	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
L376473	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Just a manner of speaking.
L376472	u6551	m435	JOE	What's okay?
L376471	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's okay.
L376470	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry, Bill --
L376425	u6551	m435	JOE	Goodnight.
L376424	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Okay.  Goodnight.
L376423	u6551	m435	JOE	Um -- not right now.
L376422	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
L376421	u6551	m435	JOE	Hello, Bill.
L376289	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you going to fire me, Bill?
L376288	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
L376287	u6551	m435	JOE	You tell me, Bill.
L376286	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What way would you put it?
L376285	u6551	m435	JOE	I wouldn't put it that way.
L376284	u6552	m435	PARRISH	About Susan?
L376283	u6551	m435	JOE	I guess...
L376282	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You were just curious?
L376281	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't know.
L376280	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Why did you go to the hospital?
L376176	u6551	m435	JOE	Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
L376175	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
L376174	u6551	m435	JOE	Okay.
L376173	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
L376172	u6551	m435	JOE	Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
L376170	u6551	m435	JOE	Absolutely.
L376169	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Dinner?  Absolutely.
L376152	u6551	m435	JOE	This part I'm interested in.
L376151	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
L376150	u6551	m435	JOE	Well...I don't know.
L376149	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Why didn't you stop me?
L376148	u6551	m435	JOE	And more.
L376147	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
L376146	u6551	m435	JOE	Uh-huh.
L376145	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
L376144	u6551	m435	JOE	Truly - uh - splendid.
L376143	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
L376142	u6551	m435	JOE	Excellent.  What is it?
L376141	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's all yours.
L376140	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you going to eat your lunch
L376079	u6551	m435	JOE	No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
L376078	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
L376075	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh.  Okay.
L376074	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Now I'd like to be alone.
L376073	u6551	m435	JOE	Of course.
L376072	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
L376071	u6551	m435	JOE	You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
L376070	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
L376069	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you sad, Bill?
L376068	u6552	m435	PARRISH	...I'd like to be alone for a while.
L376067	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't understand.
L376066	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
L376040	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376039	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Would you like to sit down, Joe?
L376028	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
L376027	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
L376026	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376025	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
L376016	u6551	m435	JOE	So can I.
L376015	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes.
L376014	u6551	m435	JOE	Can you keep a secret?
L376013	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What's it like where I'm going?
L376012	u6551	m435	JOE	What do you mean?
L376011	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What's it like?
L376010	u6551	m435	JOE	I understand.
L376009	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I want to live.
L376008	u6551	m435	JOE	That's what everybody says.
L376007	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm not everybody.
L376006	u6551	m435	JOE	That's what everybody says.
L376005	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
L376004	u6551	m435	JOE	Not this.
L376003	u6552	m435	PARRISH	There's one to every rule.
L376002	u6551	m435	JOE	Make an exception?
L376001	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How about giving a guy a break?
L376000	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes, Bill.
L375999	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe --?
L375998	u6551	m435	JOE	So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L375997	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Of course.
L375996	u6551	m435	JOE	So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
L375995	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I guess so.
L375994	u6551	m435	JOE	You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
L375993	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What do you mean?
L375992	u6551	m435	JOE	When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
L375989	u6551	m435	JOE	You've got a deal.
L375988	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes?
L375987	u6551	m435	JOE	Bill --
L375986	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
L375985	u6551	m435	JOE	A 'deal'?
L375984	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It is a deal?
L375983	u6551	m435	JOE	Sounds fair enough.
L375982	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And I won't tell anyone who you are.
L375981	u6551	m435	JOE	And what?
L375979	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
L375978	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
L375977	u6551	m435	JOE	'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
L375976	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How are you?  How're you feeling?
L375975	u6551	m435	JOE	Good morning, Bill.
L375974	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning.
L375922	u6551	m435	JOE	Good night to you, Bill.
L375921	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
L375920	u6551	m435	JOE	Not at all.
L375919	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, thank you for letting me know.
L375918	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Closer than that.
L375917	u6551	m435	JOE	I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
L375916	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No --
L375915	u6551	m435	JOE	Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
L375914	u6552	m435	PARRISH	...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
L375913	u6551	m435	JOE	That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
L375912	u6552	m435	PARRISH	When you go, I go.
L375911	u6551	m435	JOE	You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
L375910	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How long have I got?
L375909	u6551	m435	JOE	I won't.
L375908	u6552	m435	PARRISH	If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
L375907	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L375906	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
L375905	u6551	m435	JOE	What a good idea.
L375902	u6551	m435	JOE	It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
L375901	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
L375900	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L375899	u6552	m435	PARRISH	So there's nothing between you and Susan?
L375898	u6551	m435	JOE	I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
L375897	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
L375896	u6551	m435	JOE	'Threw' you?  Where?
L375895	u6552	m435	PARRISH	...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
L375891	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you.
L375890	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, that's the kitchen.
L375847	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
L375846	u6551	m435	JOE	No --
L375811	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Then don't.
L375810	u6552	m435	PARRISH	When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
L375809	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Speak up, please.
L375808	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It just occurred to me --
L375807	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Of course.
L375806	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Excuse me?  Could I say something?
L375805	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
L375804	u6552	m435	PARRISH	This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
L375801	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And then --?
L375800	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You should hope quite a while.
L375799	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I do?  How long will you be staying?
L375798	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You fill the bill, Bill.
L375797	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You want me to be your guide --?
L375796	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
L375795	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
L375794	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	That's me.
L375793	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Death!
L375792	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Yes.
L375790	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	'...Yes --'
L375789	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You are --?
L375788	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
L375787	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I am not a dream.
L375786	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
L375783	u6556	m435	VOICE	Yes, Bill.  The question.
L375782	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The 'question' --
L375781	u6556	m435	VOICE	Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
L375780	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What question?
L375779	u6556	m435	VOICE	'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
L375778	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes what?
L375777	u6556	m435	VOICE	In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
L375776	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry --
L375775	u6556	m435	VOICE	Watch it!
L375774	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What the hell are you talking about?
L375773	u6556	m435	VOICE	Time.
L375772	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Get what?
L375771	u6556	m435	VOICE	Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
L375770	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'The one' to do what?
L375769	u6556	m435	VOICE	It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
L375768	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Take me'...?  Where?
L375767	u6556	m435	VOICE	I want to have a look around before I take you.
L375766	u6552	m435	PARRISH	About what?
L375765	u6556	m435	VOICE	Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
L375764	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What the hell is this?  Who are you?
L375763	u6556	m435	VOICE	The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
L375761	u6556	m435	VOICE	Quiet.
L375760	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
L375759	u6556	m435	VOICE	I'm here.
L375758	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Where are you?
L375701	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
L375700	u6556	m435	VOICE	I think you know --
L375699	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What do you mean?!
L375698	u6556	m435	VOICE	There's going to be plenty of time for that.
L375697	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Please.  Talk to me --
L375696	u6556	m435	VOICE	It's enough now.
L375695	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Where are you?  Are you there?
L375694	u6556	m435	VOICE	No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
L375693	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry, I --
L375692	u6556	m435	VOICE	Are you giving me orders?
L375690	u6556	m435	VOICE	What you were talking about.
L375689	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What are you talking about?
L375688	u6556	m435	VOICE	Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
L375687	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't!
L375686	u6556	m435	VOICE	I think you know --
L375684	u6556	m435	VOICE	I believe you did.
L375683	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I didn't ask any question.
L375682	u6556	m435	VOICE	'Yes' is the answer to your question.
L375681	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Yes' what?
L375611	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What?
L375610	u6556	m435	VOICE	'...I know, it's none of my business.'
L376684	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Sir, I'll deliver the package.
L376683	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Quince, I've got confidence in you.
L376682	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You think Drew will go for it?
L376681	u6552	m435	PARRISH	All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
L376676	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, I believe I do.
L376675	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
L376674	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sure.
L376673	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
L376671	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
L376670	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
L376366	u6553	m435	QUINCE	The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
L376365	u6552	m435	PARRISH	This one.
L376361	u6553	m435	QUINCE	See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
L376360	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yeah, I give a shit.
L376359	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
L376357	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
L376356	u6553	m435	QUINCE	This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
L376189	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
L376188	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
L376187	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah.  Or the week after.
L376186	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Next week?
L376185	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
L376184	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank you, Quince.
L376183	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
L375564	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
L375563	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How's that, Quince?
L375562	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I am, this is it.  B Day.
L375561	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm doing great.  You ready?
L375560	u6553	m435	QUINCE	How're you doing--?
L375559	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning, Quince.
L375558	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Hi, Bill --
L376793	u6554	m435	SLOANE	But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
L376792	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
L376756	u6554	m435	SLOANE	We're all ears.
L376755	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
L376754	u6554	m435	SLOANE	We're all here, Bill --
L376599	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
L376598	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
L376597	u6552	m435	PARRISH	If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
L376596	u6554	m435	SLOANE	No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
L376595	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
L376594	u6554	m435	SLOANE	The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
L376593	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
L376592	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
L376591	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Eddie?
L376461	u6554	m435	SLOANE	I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
L376460	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
L376459	u6554	m435	SLOANE	I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
L376458	u6552	m435	PARRISH	"Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"" shit."
L376457	u6554	m435	SLOANE	...It's not over, 'til it's over.
L376061	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
L376060	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
L376823	u6555	m435	SUSAN	The fireworks are about to start.
L376822	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What was that?
L376817	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
L376816	u6552	m435	PARRISH	If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
L376815	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Oh, yes --
L376814	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
L376810	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's why it's okay.
L376809	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I love you, Daddy --
L376808	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
L376807	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Daddy --
L376806	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
L376805	u6555	m435	SUSAN	But what?
L376804	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, but --
L376803	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Are you relieved?
L376802	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry.
L376801	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
L376800	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm having a helluva time.
L376799	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What a night.
L376574	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
L376573	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I love him.
L376572	u6552	m435	PARRISH	In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
L376571	u6555	m435	SUSAN	C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
L376570	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't know, I can't say --
L376569	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where's he going?
L376568	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
L376567	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
L376566	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You don't know anything about Joe --
L376565	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
L376564	u6552	m435	PARRISH	This is crazy --
L376563	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
L376562	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't understand.
L376561	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
L376560	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't know.
L376559	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where is he?
L376558	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe?
L376557	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where's Joe?
L376329	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It's something.
L376328	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Then what is it?
L376327	u6555	m435	SUSAN	When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
L376326	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Nothing.
L376325	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
L376324	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
L376323	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Then what will you say?
L376322	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
L376321	u6555	m435	SUSAN	"Well, remember how you told me about ""lightning striking""?  The nature of it's in there somewhere."
L376320	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
L376319	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Raise away.
L376318	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
L376317	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yeah, it's good to get together.
L376316	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That was wonderful.
L376239	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Will it?...
L376238	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It'll come back, Daddy.
L375888	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
L375887	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
L375877	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
L375876	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
L375866	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
L375865	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What?!
L375864	u6555	m435	SUSAN	We've met.
L375863	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You know each other?
L375625	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yer damn right.
L375624	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Well, go get 'em, Pops.
L375623	u6552	m435	PARRISH	A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
L375622	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Are you okay?
L375620	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Nothing.
L375619	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What is it, Daddy --?
L375617	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Nothing.  I'm sorry.
L375616	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Daddy, what's the matter?
L375606	u6552	m435	PARRISH	He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
L375605	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Thank God.
L375604	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
L375603	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're terrible.
L375602	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
L375601	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
L375600	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
L375599	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
L375598	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Aw, you're tough.
L375597	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Bravo.
L375596	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
L375595	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
L375594	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
L375593	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's all?
L375592	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
L375591	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Don't get dirty, Dad --
L375590	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
L375589	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're not listening --
L375588	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
L375587	u6555	m435	SUSAN	So what's wrong with that?
L375586	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
L375585	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What were you going to say?
L375584	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, I wasn't going to say that --
L375583	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
L375582	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
L375581	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Uh oh --
L375580	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Don't get carried away.
L375579	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Probably.
L375578	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
L375577	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You mean like you loved Mom?
L375576	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do you love Drew?
L375574	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know it's none of my business --
L375573	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...There's a start for a meeting.
L375572	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I am.  With you.
L375571	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I thought you were in a meeting--?
L375570	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
L375569	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're only six-five once.
L375568	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Not my birthday again?
L375538	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...Then don't.
L375537	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't like to interfere.
L375536	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yeah.  I guess so.
L375535	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You like him, don't you?
L375534	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I hope so.
L375533	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Does Drew tell you everything?
L375532	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew told me.
L375531	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How did you know?
L375530	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
L375524	u6555	m435	SUSAN	He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
L375523	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Drew's aboard?
L375520	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hi, honey.
L375519	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Good morning, Dad.
L376855	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	But we've got time.
L376854	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...We know so little about each other.
L376851	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Y'didn't?
L376850	u6555	m435	SUSAN	No --
L376849	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You said you liked me.
L375723	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
L375722	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Why not?
L375721	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
L375720	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
L375719	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why?
L375718	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
L375717	u6555	m435	SUSAN	No, it was so right it scares me.
L375716	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Did I say something wrong?
L375715	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I've got to go --
L375714	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You never know.  Lightning could strike.
L375713	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
L375712	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I would.
L375711	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
L375710	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
L375709	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
L375708	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	...It's kind of a pro bono job.
L375669	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
L375668	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I've got patients coming in --
L375667	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	How 'bout another cup of coffee?
L375666	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Not at all.
L375665	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
L375664	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
L375663	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	'Her'.
L375662	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I could be her.
L375661	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
L375660	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Me?  Internal medicine.
L375659	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
L375658	u6555	m435	SUSAN	How'd you know?
L375657	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
L375656	u6555	m435	SUSAN	So you're a one-girl guy?
L375655	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
L375654	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
L375653	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Why?
L375652	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I agree --
L375651	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Nothing lasts.
L375650	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What's the way?
L375649	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
L375648	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry --
L375647	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
L375646	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You and 'Honey'?
L375645	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
L375644	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Not at all.  It was fascinating.
L375643	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
L377399	u6567	m436	NATALIE	I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
L377367	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
L377352	u6567	m436	NATALIE	I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
L377111	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
L377102	u6567	m436	NATALIE	This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
L376980	u6567	m436	NATALIE	It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
L377285	u6568	m436	TEDDY	From what?
L377255	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
L377156	u6568	m436	TEDDY	I think I know her.
L377042	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
L376871	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
L377244	u6559	m436	BLONDE	Whatever gets you off.
L377243	u6563	m436	LEONARD	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
L377242	u6559	m436	BLONDE	Should I wear it?
L377241	u6563	m436	LEONARD	That's it.
L377240	u6559	m436	BLONDE	That's it?
L377239	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Just loud enough to wake me up.
L377238	u6559	m436	BLONDE	Slam it?
L377237	u6563	m436	LEONARD	It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
L377236	u6559	m436	BLONDE	Well, what then?
L377407	u6563	m436	LEONARD	A cop?
L377406	u6560	m436	BURT	Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
L377405	u6563	m436	LEONARD	That's right I did, didn't I?
L377404	u6560	m436	BURT	I know you said you didn't want any calls...
L377403	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah?
L377402	u6560	m436	BURT	Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
L377052	u6560	m436	BURT	Hi, Leonard.
L377051	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
L377009	u6560	m436	BURT	Leonard.
L377008	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
L377007	u6560	m436	BURT	Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
L377006	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
L377004	u6563	m436	LEONARD	So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
L377003	u6560	m436	BURT	You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
L377001	u6560	m436	BURT	Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
L377000	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why?
L376999	u6560	m436	BURT	Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
L376998	u6563	m436	LEONARD	When was I in here?
L376997	u6560	m436	BURT	This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
L376996	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Then why is this my handwriting?
L376995	u6560	m436	BURT	No, let's go.
L376994	u6563	m436	LEONARD	This isn't my room?
L376993	u6560	m436	BURT	This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
L376992	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What?
L376991	u6560	m436	BURT	Shit. Wrong room.
L376989	u6560	m436	BURT	Hi, Leonard.
L376988	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
L376928	u6563	m436	LEONARD	He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
L376927	u6560	m436	BURT	Seen you together, that's all.
L376926	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What makes you think he's my friend?
L376923	u6560	m436	BURT	As requested.
L376922	u6563	m436	LEONARD	So you're holding my calls?
L376921	u6560	m436	BURT	Couple days.
L376920	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How long have I been here?
L376917	u6560	m436	BURT	What's it like?
L376916	u6563	m436	LEONARD	My wife.
L376913	u6563	m436	LEONARD	No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
L376912	u6560	m436	BURT	Amnesia?
L376911	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I have no memory.
L376910	u6560	m436	BURT	Condition?
L376909	u6563	m436	LEONARD	That's the thing. I have this condition.
L376908	u6560	m436	BURT	You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
L376907	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
L376906	u6560	m436	BURT	You don't know?
L376905	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
L376904	u6560	m436	BURT	Burt.
L376903	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'm sorry... um... ?

L377535	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I don't want your fucking money!
L377534	u6562	m436	JIMMY	Take the money and walk away!
L377533	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You think you can bargain with me?!

L377526	u6562	m436	JIMMY	I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
L377525	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Don't say anything else.
L377524	u6562	m436	JIMMY	You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
L377520	u6562	m436	JIMMY	Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?

L377445	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
L377444	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I don't know. I'm sorry.
L377442	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I don't know.
L377441	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Did Teddy send you?
L377439	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Are you Teddy?
L377438	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
L377437	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
L377436	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who's your boyfriend?
L377435	u6567	m436	NATALIE	My boyfriend told me about you.
L377434	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How do you know about me?
L377433	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You're the memory guy?
L377431	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You tell me.
L377430	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Oh. But haven't we met before?
L377429	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Well, that's me.
L377428	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
L377427	u6567	m436	NATALIE	What are you here for?
L377426	u6563	m436	LEONARD	There's a dress code?
L377424	u6563	m436	LEONARD	A BEER, please.
L377423	u6567	m436	NATALIE	What do you want?

L377417	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Dying.
L377416	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Sweet.
L377415	u6563	m436	LEONARD	My wife.
L377411	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Thanks.

L377396	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
L377394	u6567	m436	NATALIE	How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
L377389	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Why not?
L377388	u6563	m436	LEONARD	They're not looking for him.
L377387	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Can I ask you something?
L377380	u6567	m436	NATALIE	About your whore of a wife?
L377379	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Don't say another fucking word!
L377376	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Shut the fuck up!
L377375	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
L377374	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yes.
L377373	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
L377372	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
L377371	u6567	m436	NATALIE	That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
L377370	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Calm down.
L377369	u6567	m436	NATALIE	I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
L377368	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Don't talk about my wife.
L377365	u6563	m436	LEONARD	That's different.
L377364	u6567	m436	NATALIE	What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
L377363	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
L377362	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Kill him. I'll pay you.
L377361	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What?
L377360	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Get rid of Dodd for me.
L377359	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How?
L377358	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Help me.
L377357	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'm not.
L377356	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Don't protect him.
L377355	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Neither do I.
L377354	u6567	m436	NATALIE	What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
L377353	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What happened?
L377350	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I have this condition -
L377349	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
L377348	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What's this all about?
L377347	u6567	m436	NATALIE	No!
L377346	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Did you?
L377345	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
L377344	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What does he want?
L377343	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Calls himself Dodd.
L377342	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who?
L377341	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Somebody's come. Already.
L377340	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What's wrong?
L377335	u6567	m436	NATALIE	He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
L377334	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why would you do that?
L377333	u6567	m436	NATALIE	I told him about your car.
L377332	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Me? Why would he be interested in me?
L377330	u6567	m436	NATALIE	This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
L377329	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah, I hated it.
L377328	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Yeah?
L377327	u6563	m436	LEONARD	My wife used to call me Lenny.
L377326	u6567	m436	NATALIE	He'll kill you, Lenny.
L377325	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
L377324	u6567	m436	NATALIE	And? 
L377323	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'll go see him.
L377322	u6567	m436	NATALIE	What are you gonna do?
L377321	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Where is he?
L377320	u6567	m436	NATALIE	He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
L377319	u6563	m436	LEONARD	And what did he say?
L377314	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
L377313	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who?
L377124	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Kill him.
L377123	u6567	m436	NATALIE	They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
L377122	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What do the police think?
L377120	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who did he go to meet?
L377119	u6567	m436	NATALIE	He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
L377118	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What happened?
L377117	u6567	m436	NATALIE	His name was Jimmy.
L377113	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Just relax.
L377112	u6563	m436	LEONARD	It's not easy to be calm when -
L377109	u6563	m436	LEONARD	She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
L377108	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Your wife?
L377107	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
L377106	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Such as?
L377105	u6563	m436	LEONARD	There are things you know for sure.
L377104	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
L377100	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Course not.
L377099	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Kill him.
L377098	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What?
L377097	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Did you?
L377096	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
L377095	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Yes.
L377094	u6563	m436	LEONARD	So I just take your word?
L377093	u6567	m436	NATALIE	I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
L377092	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How do I know he did that to you?
L377091	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
L377090	u6563	m436	LEONARD	That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
L377089	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
L377086	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who is he? What have you got me into?
L377085	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
L377062	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah. You?
L377061	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Sleep okay?
L376984	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You know what we have in common?
L376983	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Don't remember.
L376982	u6567	m436	NATALIE	They treating you alright?
L376978	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Sorry.
L376977	u6567	m436	NATALIE	I wasn't helping you for money.
L376976	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
L376975	u6567	m436	NATALIE	It's isolated.
L376974	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Deals?
L376973	u6567	m436	NATALIE	I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
L376969	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
L376968	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why?
L376967	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Tell me about her again.
L376965	u6567	m436	NATALIE	But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
L376964	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Then you shouldn't have to ask.
L376963	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Yes.
L376961	u6567	m436	NATALIE	No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
L376960	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You know him?
L376957	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
L376956	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yes.
L376955	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Is that what your little note says?
L376954	u6563	m436	LEONARD	So you have information for me?
L376953	u6567	m436	NATALIE	Yeah.
L376951	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You told me.
L376950	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
L376949	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You did explain, Lenny.
L376948	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
L376947	u6567	m436	NATALIE	You don't remember me.
L377309	u6563	m436	LEONARD	She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
L377308	u6566	m436	MRS. JANKIS	Thank you.
L377307	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
L377306	u6566	m436	MRS. JANKIS	I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
L377305	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
L377302	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Then why are you here?
L377301	u6566	m436	MRS. JANKIS	I'm not appealing the decision.
L377300	u6563	m436	LEONARD	We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
L377299	u6566	m436	MRS. JANKIS	I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
L377298	u6563	m436	LEONARD	"Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is ""faking"" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -"
L377297	u6566	m436	MRS. JANKIS	Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
L377210	u6565	m436	LEONARD'S WIFE	Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
L377209	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
L377208	u6565	m436	LEONARD'S WIFE	I enjoy it.
L377207	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You've read it a hundred times.
L377206	u6565	m436	LEONARD'S WIFE	It's good.
L377205	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How can you read that again?
L377622	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You can't just take it!
L377621	u6563	m436	LEONARD	It is now.
L377614	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Your name's Teddy.
L377601	u6563	m436	LEONARD	When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
L377600	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You won't remember!
L377599	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Somehow, I'll know!
L377598	u6568	m436	TEDDY	No, you won't.
L377597	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yes, I will.
L377588	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Are you sure?
L377587	u6563	m436	LEONARD	My wife wasn't diabetic.
L377585	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Sammy didn't have a wife.
L377584	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
L377583	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
L377582	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I never said he was faking! I never said that!
L377581	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Sammy was a con man. A faker.
L377579	u6568	m436	TEDDY	"Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. ""learning through repetition"" -"
L377578	u6563	m436	LEONARD	That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
L377577	u6568	m436	TEDDY	I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
L377576	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What the fuck are you talking about?
L377575	u6568	m436	TEDDY	"You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. ""Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis"". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?"
L377568	u6563	m436	LEONARD	This is a drug deal?!
L377555	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
L377554	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I don't know. See, I have this condition.
L377551	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Maybe. Maybe just.
L377550	u6568	m436	TEDDY	No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
L377549	u6563	m436	LEONARD	He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
L377548	u6563	m436	LEONARD	There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
L377547	u6568	m436	TEDDY	What's wrong?
L377510	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You're not coming?
L377497	u6568	m436	TEDDY	I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
L377496	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How do you know him?
L377495	u6568	m436	TEDDY	'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
L377494	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How do you know this?
L377488	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why not?
L377487	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
L377486	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why?
L377478	u6568	m436	TEDDY	The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
L377477	u6563	m436	LEONARD	How'd you know I was in here?
L377293	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
L377292	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
L377291	u6568	m436	TEDDY	I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
L377290	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I didn't sell -
L377289	u6568	m436	TEDDY	That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
L377288	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
L377287	u6568	m436	TEDDY	So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
L377286	u6563	m436	LEONARD	My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
L377283	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I have money.
L377282	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
L377281	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Like what?
L377280	u6568	m436	TEDDY	The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
L377279	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What sort of questions?
L377278	u6568	m436	TEDDY	How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
L377277	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why?
L377276	u6568	m436	TEDDY	I won't be happy until you leave town.
L377275	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Happy now?
L377274	u6568	m436	TEDDY	I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
L377273	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why are you following me?
L377272	u6568	m436	TEDDY	She has no idea who I am.
L377271	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
L377270	u6568	m436	TEDDY	She couldn't.
L377269	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
L377268	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
L377267	u6563	m436	LEONARD	From who?
L377266	u6568	m436	TEDDY	She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
L377264	u6568	m436	TEDDY	She's involved with these drug dealers.
L377263	u6563	m436	LEONARD	"What do you mean ""bad news""?"
L377261	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
L377260	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why's that?
L377258	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who's she?
L377257	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
L377256	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Unfinished business.
L377252	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
L377251	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Prove it.
L377250	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Teddy. Your buddy.
L377249	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who the fuck are you?
L377183	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Natalie who?
L377182	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
L377181	u6568	m436	TEDDY	So what are you gonna do now?
L377180	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You like it? Let's trade.
L377179	u6563	m436	LEONARD	What's wrong with this one?
L377178	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
L377176	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
L377175	u6568	m436	TEDDY	So was he scared?
L377172	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Give me your keys.
L377171	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'll ride with him. You follow.
L377170	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
L377169	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Shut it, Teddy.
L377168	u6568	m436	TEDDY	We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
L377166	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Fucking hope not.
L377165	u6563	m436	LEONARD	It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
L377161	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I don't know.
L377160	u6568	m436	TEDDY	How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
L377159	u6563	m436	LEONARD	We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
L377158	u6568	m436	TEDDY	He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
L377157	u6563	m436	LEONARD	We've got to get him out of here.
L377154	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why?
L377153	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Natalie? Natalie who?
L377152	u6563	m436	LEONARD	No. No, just let me think for a minute.
L377151	u6568	m436	TEDDY	I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
L377142	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I might have fallen asleep before I did.
L377141	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
L377140	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I don't think so.
L377139	u6568	m436	TEDDY	No! Should I?
L377138	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You don't know him?
L377137	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
L377136	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why are you here?
L377050	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Probably left it in your room.
L377049	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
L377047	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
L377046	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You're living.
L377045	u6563	m436	LEONARD	He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
L377044	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You really want to find this guy?
L377040	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why?
L377039	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
L377038	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
L377037	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
L377036	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Why?
L377035	u6568	m436	TEDDY	The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
L377034	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Who?
L377033	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
L377032	u6563	m436	LEONARD	It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
L377031	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You don't have to remember to be hungry.
L377030	u6563	m436	LEONARD	It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
L377028	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
L377027	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Guess I've told you about my condition.
L377026	u6568	m436	TEDDY	So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
L377025	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Things change.
L377024	u6568	m436	TEDDY	You said you were leaving town.
L377023	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
L376943	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
L376942	u6563	m436	LEONARD	John Gammell?
L376941	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Lenny, is that you?
L376940	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Mr Gammell?
L376939	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Yup?
L376896	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I don't remember.
L376894	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You know it?
L376893	u6568	m436	TEDDY	What the hell you want to go there for?
L376887	u6563	m436	LEONARD	You're in a playful mood.
L376886	u6568	m436	TEDDY	This is your car.
L376883	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I guess I've told you about my condition.
L376876	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
L376875	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Shut your mouth!
L376874	u6568	m436	TEDDY	That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
L376873	u6563	m436	LEONARD	I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
L376870	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Teddy!
L376869	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
L376868	u6563	m436	LEONARD	Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
L377567	u6568	m436	TEDDY	A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
L377164	u6568	m436	TEDDY	Why would I have a gun?
L399385	u6714	m448	ADAM	Git along little dowgie and call me back.
L399384	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
L399383	u6714	m448	ADAM	I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
L399382	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	I'm just offering a place to stay.
L399381	u6714	m448	ADAM	Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
L399380	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
L399379	u6714	m448	ADAM	Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
L399378	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Will you meet with him?
L399377	u6714	m448	ADAM	You gotta be kidding?
L399376	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
L399375	u6714	m448	ADAM	And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
L399374	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	It's been a very strange day.
L399373	u6714	m448	ADAM	Cynthia...what's going on?
L399372	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
L399371	u6714	m448	ADAM	Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
L399370	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
L399369	u6714	m448	ADAM	The Cowboy??
L399368	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
L399367	u6714	m448	ADAM	Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
L399366	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
L399365	u6714	m448	ADAM	But I'm not broke.
L399364	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	You're broke!
L399363	u6714	m448	ADAM	And?
L399362	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
L399361	u6714	m448	ADAM	"What do you mean ""you know""?"
L399360	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	I know.  Where are you Adam?
L399359	u6714	m448	ADAM	Someone's shut off my money!
L399268	u6714	m448	ADAM	I'm going home. I'll call you later.
L399267	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
L399266	u6714	m448	ADAM	I'm going home Cynthia.
L399265	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
L399264	u6714	m448	ADAM	I'm going home.
L399263	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
L399262	u6714	m448	ADAM	No.
L399261	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
L399260	u6714	m448	ADAM	Who fired everyone?
L399259	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	They fired everyone.
L399258	u6714	m448	ADAM	What did you say?
L399257	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
L399256	u6714	m448	ADAM	What's going on, Cynthia?
L399255	u6719	m448	CYNTHIA	Adam, where are you?
L399181	u6714	m448	ADAM	And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
L399180	u6732	m448	RAY	I'll speak to someone.
L399179	u6714	m448	ADAM	You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
L399162	u6714	m448	ADAM	Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
L399161	u6732	m448	RAY	We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
L399142	u6714	m448	ADAM	So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
L399141	u6732	m448	RAY	There is no problem.
L399140	u6714	m448	ADAM	So what's the problem?
L399417	u6714	m448	ADAM	Okay.
L399416	u6718	m448	COWBOY	No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
L399415	u6714	m448	ADAM	So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
L399414	u6718	m448	COWBOY	You're an understandin' fella.
L399413	u6714	m448	ADAM	I understand.
L399412	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
L399411	u6714	m448	ADAM	It will work out.
L399410	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
L399409	u6714	m448	ADAM	Okay.
L399408	u6718	m448	COWBOY	So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
L399407	u6714	m448	ADAM	One.
L399406	u6718	m448	COWBOY	There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
L399405	u6714	m448	ADAM	Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
L399404	u6718	m448	COWBOY	No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
L399403	u6714	m448	ADAM	Okay, I'm thinking.
L399402	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
L399401	u6714	m448	ADAM	How's that?
L399400	u6718	m448	COWBOY	So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
L399399	u6714	m448	ADAM	That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
L399398	u6718	m448	COWBOY	What did I say?
L399397	u6714	m448	ADAM	I agree with what you said...truly.
L399396	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
L399395	u6714	m448	ADAM	Sure.
L399394	u6718	m448	COWBOY	A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
L399393	u6714	m448	ADAM	Whatever.
L399392	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
L399391	u6714	m448	ADAM	No problem. What's on your mind?
L399390	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
L399389	u6714	m448	ADAM	Yeah.
L399388	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Beautiful night.
L399387	u6714	m448	ADAM	Howdy to you.
L399386	u6718	m448	COWBOY	Howdy!
L399358	u6726	m448	HOTEL MANAGER	Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
L399357	u6714	m448	ADAM	Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
L399356	u6726	m448	HOTEL MANAGER	That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
L399355	u6714	m448	ADAM	Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
L399354	u6726	m448	HOTEL MANAGER	Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
L399353	u6714	m448	ADAM	So, what did they say?
L399352	u6726	m448	HOTEL MANAGER	I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
L399351	u6714	m448	ADAM	How...  how'd they know I was here?
L399350	u6726	m448	HOTEL MANAGER	The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
L399349	u6714	m448	ADAM	... What??
L399348	u6726	m448	HOTEL MANAGER	I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
L399347	u6714	m448	ADAM	Yes...what is it?
L399483	u6717	m448	COCO	Good luck, honey!
L399482	u6715	m448	BETTY	Right. See ya.
L399481	u6717	m448	COCO	Get going. You don't want to be late.
L399480	u6715	m448	BETTY	Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
L399479	u6717	m448	COCO	Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
L399478	u6715	m448	BETTY	Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
L399477	u6717	m448	COCO	His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
L399476	u6715	m448	BETTY	No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
L399475	u6717	m448	COCO	It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
L399474	u6715	m448	BETTY	Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
L399454	u6717	m448	COCO	Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
L399453	u6715	m448	BETTY	You're really something Coco...thank you.
L399451	u6715	m448	BETTY	Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
L399450	u6717	m448	COCO	So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
L399449	u6715	m448	BETTY	Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
L399448	u6717	m448	COCO	Sweetie, look at me straight.
L399447	u6715	m448	BETTY	It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
L399446	u6717	m448	COCO	She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
L399445	u6715	m448	BETTY	I was afraid of that.
L399444	u6717	m448	COCO	Your Aunt called me.
L399105	u6717	m448	COCO	You got it! See you later honey.
L399104	u6715	m448	BETTY	Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
L399103	u6717	m448	COCO	Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
L399102	u6715	m448	BETTY	Wow!
L399101	u6717	m448	COCO	I told ya.
L399100	u6715	m448	BETTY	It's unbelievable!
L399099	u6715	m448	BETTY	I can hardly wait, Coco.
L399098	u6717	m448	COCO	That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
L399097	u6715	m448	BETTY	No, I don't.
L399095	u6717	m448	COCO	Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
L399094	u6715	m448	BETTY	I guess I've come to quite a place.
L399093	u6717	m448	COCO	Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
L399092	u6715	m448	BETTY	Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
L399091	u6717	m448	COCO	You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
L399090	u6715	m448	BETTY	I...
L399089	u6717	m448	COCO	"You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called ""tits and ass."""
L399088	u6715	m448	BETTY	Well, I ...
L399087	u6717	m448	COCO	Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
L399086	u6715	m448	BETTY	Yes, he is. He raises corn.
L399085	u6717	m448	COCO	I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
L399116	u6715	m448	BETTY	Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
L399115	u6721	m448	DARK-HAIRED WOMAN	My name is Rita.
L399114	u6715	m448	BETTY	Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
L399113	u6721	m448	DARK-HAIRED WOMAN	I think so. I was just taking a shower.
L399112	u6715	m448	BETTY	Are you okay?
L399111	u6721	m448	DARK-HAIRED WOMAN	A car ... a car accident.
L399110	u6715	m448	BETTY	I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
L399109	u6721	m448	DARK-HAIRED WOMAN	There was an accident. I came here.
L399108	u6715	m448	BETTY	I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
L399107	u6721	m448	DARK-HAIRED WOMAN	That's okay.
L399513	u6735	m448	WALLY	Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
L399512	u6715	m448	BETTY	No, no, I'm fine.
L399511	u6735	m448	WALLY	Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
L399510	u6715	m448	BETTY	Hi.
L399505	u6735	m448	WALLY	Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
L399504	u6715	m448	BETTY	Very pleased to meet you.
L399503	u6735	m448	WALLY	I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
L399502	u6715	m448	BETTY	Yes.
L399501	u6735	m448	WALLY	Betty Elms?
L399538	u6727	m448	JIMMY	Before what?
L399537	u6715	m448	BETTY	Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
L399532	u6727	m448	JIMMY	But you won't.
L399531	u6715	m448	BETTY	I can call them... I can call my dad.
L399526	u6727	m448	JIMMY	I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
L399525	u6715	m448	BETTY	You're still here?
L399522	u6727	m448	JIMMY	Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
L399521	u6715	m448	BETTY	Betty.
L399518	u6727	m448	JIMMY	I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
L399517	u6715	m448	BETTY	What?
L399516	u6727	m448	JIMMY	Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
L399305	u6734	m448	SERGEANT BAXTER	May I have your name please?
L399304	u6715	m448	BETTY	Was anyone hurt?
L399303	u6734	m448	SERGEANT BAXTER	No. I can't.
L399302	u6715	m448	BETTY	Can you tell me what happened?
L399301	u6734	m448	SERGEANT BAXTER	Yes, there was.
L399300	u6715	m448	BETTY	Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
L399607	u6730	m448	MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN	I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
L399606	u6715	m448	BETTY	Well ... we'll leave her a note.
L399605	u6730	m448	MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN	I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
L399604	u6715	m448	BETTY	But it said #12.
L399603	u6730	m448	MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN	Number 17.
L399602	u6715	m448	BETTY	Diane?
L399601	u6730	m448	MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN	Yes?
L399625	u6715	m448	BETTY	Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
L399624	u6733	m448	RITA	It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
L399623	u6715	m448	BETTY	No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
L399622	u6733	m448	RITA	But I want to.
L399621	u6715	m448	BETTY	Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
L399615	u6715	m448	BETTY	I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
L399614	u6733	m448	RITA	What ... I..HAVE... to do.
L399613	u6715	m448	BETTY	Rita... I know what you're doing.
L399611	u6733	m448	RITA	No.
L399610	u6715	m448	BETTY	C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
L399609	u6733	m448	RITA	I don't think...
L399598	u6715	m448	BETTY	Keep going. Go around to the back.
L399597	u6733	m448	RITA	No... but...
L399596	u6715	m448	BETTY	Do you know them?!
L399595	u6733	m448	RITA	Those men in front, in the car.
L399594	u6715	m448	BETTY	What is it? What do you see?!
L399593	u6733	m448	RITA	Don't stop!
L399591	u6715	m448	BETTY	You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
L399590	u6733	m448	RITA	But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
L399589	u6715	m448	BETTY	Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
L399473	u6733	m448	RITA	Okay.
L399472	u6715	m448	BETTY	When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
L399471	u6733	m448	RITA	Good luck!
L399470	u6715	m448	BETTY	I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
L399456	u6715	m448	BETTY	Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
L399455	u6733	m448	RITA	Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
L399440	u6715	m448	BETTY	You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
L399439	u6733	m448	RITA	I'm all right.
L399438	u6715	m448	BETTY	Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
L399433	u6733	m448	RITA	Then they'd put you in jail.
L399432	u6715	m448	BETTY	Before I kill you.
L399431	u6733	m448	RITA	Before what?
L399430	u6715	m448	BETTY	Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
L399429	u6733	m448	RITA	What about you? What will your dad think about you?
L399428	u6715	m448	BETTY	Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... 
L399427	u6733	m448	RITA	You know what I want...it's not that difficult.
L399426	u6715	m448	BETTY	You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.
L399425	u6733	m448	RITA	But you won't...
L399424	u6715	m448	BETTY	I can call them... I can call my dad... 
L399423	u6733	m448	RITA	So... surprise...
L399422	u6715	m448	BETTY	My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left...
L399421	u6733	m448	RITA	Really?
L399419	u6733	m448	RITA	I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
L399418	u6715	m448	BETTY	You're still here?
L399333	u6715	m448	BETTY	I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
L399332	u6733	m448	RITA	I'm not sure about this.
L399331	u6715	m448	BETTY	What's wrong with that?
L399324	u6733	m448	RITA	Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
L399323	u6715	m448	BETTY	Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
L399322	u6733	m448	RITA	It's not my voice ... but I know her.
L399320	u6715	m448	BETTY	Call the number.
L399319	u6733	m448	RITA	Maybe it's not me.
L399318	u6715	m448	BETTY	Strange to be calling yourself.
L399312	u6715	m448	BETTY	We'll take our check.
L399311	u6733	m448	RITA	No. Just the coffee.
L399308	u6715	m448	BETTY	Not that I can see.
L399307	u6733	m448	RITA	There's nothing?
L399279	u6715	m448	BETTY	Come on... let's find you something to wear.
L399278	u6733	m448	RITA	Okay.
L399277	u6715	m448	BETTY	Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
L399276	u6733	m448	RITA	Okay... but just...just to see.
L399275	u6715	m448	BETTY	We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
L399274	u6733	m448	RITA	No.... I don't...
L399273	u6715	m448	BETTY	Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
L399272	u6733	m448	RITA	That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
L399271	u6715	m448	BETTY	Mulholland Drive?
L399270	u6733	m448	RITA	Mulholland Drive.
L399246	u6715	m448	BETTY	When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
L399245	u6733	m448	RITA	Unh, unh.
L399244	u6715	m448	BETTY	The money. You don't know where it came from?
L399243	u6733	m448	RITA	No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
L399242	u6715	m448	BETTY	You don't remember anything else?
L399241	u6733	m448	RITA	I don't know.
L399240	u6715	m448	BETTY	How do you remember how to talk?
L399239	u6733	m448	RITA	Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
L399238	u6715	m448	BETTY	Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
L399237	u6733	m448	RITA	What do you mean?
L399236	u6715	m448	BETTY	Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
L399197	u6733	m448	RITA	I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
L399196	u6715	m448	BETTY	What do you mean? You're Rita.
L399195	u6733	m448	RITA	I don't know who I am.
L399194	u6715	m448	BETTY	What's wrong?
L399193	u6733	m448	RITA	I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
L399192	u6715	m448	BETTY	What is it Rita?
L399128	u6715	m448	BETTY	All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
L399127	u6733	m448	RITA	It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
L399126	u6715	m448	BETTY	If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
L399125	u6733	m448	RITA	No...I need to sleep.
L399124	u6715	m448	BETTY	But, this could be serious.
L399123	u6733	m448	RITA	No.
L399122	u6715	m448	BETTY	Oh...
L399121	u6733	m448	RITA	I think I've been hurt.
L399120	u6715	m448	BETTY	She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
L399119	u6733	m448	RITA	She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
L399118	u6715	m448	BETTY	I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
L399117	u6733	m448	RITA	No ..........I.
L399495	u6715	m448	BETTY	Thank you... thank you very much.
L399494	u6731	m448	PARAMOUNT GUARD	Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
L399493	u6715	m448	BETTY	Betty Elms.
L399492	u6731	m448	PARAMOUNT GUARD	Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
L399491	u6715	m448	BETTY	Yes, Sir.
L399490	u6731	m448	PARAMOUNT GUARD	Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
L399489	u6715	m448	BETTY	No, we don't.
L399488	u6731	m448	PARAMOUNT GUARD	And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
L399487	u6715	m448	BETTY	Wally Brown.
L399486	u6731	m448	PARAMOUNT GUARD	And who are we auditioning for today?
L399485	u6715	m448	BETTY	To my audition.
L399220	u6728	m448	JOE	It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
L399219	u6716	m448	BILLY	Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
L399218	u6728	m448	JOE	What's  the matter now?
L399217	u6716	m448	BILLY	Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
L399216	u6728	m448	JOE	Yeah, what for?
L399215	u6716	m448	BILLY	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
L399214	u6728	m448	JOE	You're so easy.
L399213	u6716	m448	BILLY	My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
L399212	u6728	m448	JOE	No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
L399211	u6716	m448	BILLY	Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
L399067	u6725	m448	HERB	Right then.
L399066	u6720	m448	DAN	To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
L399065	u6725	m448	HERB	So, you came to see if he's out there?
L399064	u6720	m448	DAN	Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
L399063	u6725	m448	HERB	Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
L399062	u6720	m448	DAN	You see what I mean...
L399061	u6725	m448	HERB	Oh boy.
L399060	u6720	m448	DAN	I had a dream about this place.
L399059	u6725	m448	HERB	Go ahead.
L399058	u6720	m448	DAN	It's kind of embarrassing but,
L399057	u6725	m448	HERB	Okay. Why this Denny's?
L399056	u6720	m448	DAN	This Denny's.
L399055	u6725	m448	HERB	To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
L399054	u6720	m448	DAN	I just wanted to come here.
L399053	u6725	m448	HERB	Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
L399469	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Damn, that's a long drive.
L399468	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Palmdale.
L399467	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Where at?
L399466	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
L399465	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Interesting.
L399464	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
L399463	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Find out who they are?
L399462	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
L399461	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Oh yeah.
L399460	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
L399459	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	The one of 'em still alive?
L399458	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
L399457	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Nice wallets.
L399052	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	That's what I'm thinkin'.
L399051	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
L399050	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
L399049	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Could be unrelated.
L399048	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Yeah, they showed me
L399047	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
L399046	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
L399045	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
L399044	u6723	m448	DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD	Yeah.
L399043	u6722	m448	DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT	You feel it?
L399137	u6728	m448	JOE	Yeah, that's a funny story.
L399136	u6724	m448	ED	It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
L399135	u6728	m448	JOE	Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
L399134	u6724	m448	ED	Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
L399133	u6728	m448	JOE	Hardly.
L399132	u6724	m448	ED	Making ends meet, huh.
L399131	u6728	m448	JOE	Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
L399130	u6724	m448	ED	Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
L399129	u6728	m448	JOE	So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
L399229	u6729	m448	LANEY	Sure.
L399228	u6728	m448	JOE	You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
L399227	u6729	m448	LANEY	No...
L399226	u6728	m448	JOE	A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
L399225	u6729	m448	LANEY	No.  I haven't seen any.
L399224	u6728	m448	JOE	Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
L399223	u6729	m448	LANEY	No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
L399222	u6728	m448	JOE	Not a coke or anything?
L399221	u6729	m448	LANEY	Not here...no thanks.
L401919	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
L401918	u6736	m449	ANNOUNCER	You must come in first place to move on !
L401796	u6736	m449	ANNOUNCER	Pick with expediency !
L401795	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
L401794	u6736	m449	ANNOUNCER	So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
L401690	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
L401689	u6736	m449	ANNOUNCER	And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
L401682	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Where's the dock ?
L401681	u6736	m449	ANNOUNCER	That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
L401543	u6743	m449	ZACH	Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
L401542	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
L401540	u6743	m449	ZACH	I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
L401539	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Good morning. What do you have today ?
L401401	u6737	m449	BRUCE	No one has a gun to your head.
L401400	u6743	m449	ZACH	I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
L401399	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
L401396	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Yeah, I'd say that's it.
L401395	u6743	m449	ZACH	Is that it ?
L402053	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Bye....
L402052	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
L402051	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Yeah a real shame.
L402050	u6737	m449	BRUCE	That's a shame.
L402049	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
L402048	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
L402047	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	That was eleven years ago.
L402046	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I work here, remember ?
L402045	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What are you DOING here ?
L401983	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
L401982	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Just stop it. End it here.
L401977	u6737	m449	BRUCE	There's one more person here for me to visit.
L401976	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What about you ?
L401952	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Girder, watch your head.
L401951	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What was that ?
L401950	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Yes.
L401949	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Do you know where you're going ?
L401930	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
L401929	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I don't get it.
L401908	u6737	m449	BRUCE	The Brooklyn Bridge.
L401907	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Where are we going ?
L401904	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Great...
L401903	u6737	m449	BRUCE	You don't. It's random, there no trick.
L401902	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
L401901	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
L401900	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	This is cute.
L401899	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Let's go.
L401898	u6737	m449	BRUCE	If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
L401889	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Fine...
L401888	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	You okay ?
L401887	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Okay.
L401886	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
L401881	u6737	m449	BRUCE	So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
L401880	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
L401879	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Know what ? That it was your fault ?
L401878	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I wanted to let his family know....
L401877	u6737	m449	BRUCE	You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
L401876	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I... I .....
L401874	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
L401873	u6737	m449	BRUCE	What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
L401872	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
L401871	u6737	m449	BRUCE	This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
L401870	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
L401869	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
L401868	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	And you believe that ?
L401867	u6737	m449	BRUCE	McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
L401866	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What do you mean ?
L401865	u6737	m449	BRUCE	There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
L401864	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
L401863	u6737	m449	BRUCE	There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
L401862	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
L401861	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
L401860	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
L401859	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
L401858	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
L401857	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
L401849	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
L401848	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	He hired you to build this place ?
L401847	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
L401846	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Do you have something better to talk about ?
L401845	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Is this really the time ?
L401844	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Why did you build this whole place ?
L401843	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Excuse me ?
L401842	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	So why this ?
L401840	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
L401839	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	How long till the room fills ?
L401838	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
L401837	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Obviously, but what's the way out ?
L401836	u6737	m449	BRUCE	We drown.
L401835	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What's the trick here ?
L401829	u6737	m449	BRUCE	At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
L401828	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'm listening.
L401827	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
L401826	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Not listening !
L401825	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
L401807	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
L401806	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
L401805	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'm not listening.
L401804	u6737	m449	BRUCE	So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
L401793	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Why would he ? His parents are rich.
L401792	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
L401791	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	NO ! I wouldn't do that.
L401790	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
L401789	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
L401788	u6737	m449	BRUCE	If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
L401787	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
L401786	u6737	m449	BRUCE	You took an awful big risk back there.
L401785	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What ?
L401784	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
L401779	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'm leaving.
L401778	u6737	m449	BRUCE	What are you doing ?
L401769	u6737	m449	BRUCE	"Knows ? He watches every ""Guest"" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we."
L401768	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	McCay knows ?
L401767	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
L401766	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	First Bank ? But how ?
L401765	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
L401764	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
L401763	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I'm working on it.
L401762	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	So what do we do ?
L401761	u6737	m449	BRUCE	No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
L401760	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	So where does this lead ?
L401739	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Give me a fucking.....
L401738	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Come on, it works.
L401730	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
L401729	u6737	m449	BRUCE	There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
L401726	u6737	m449	BRUCE	We have to climb up that.
L401725	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
L401717	u6737	m449	BRUCE	We wait. This is an elevator.
L401716	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	How do we get out of this room ?
L401697	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I don't know.
L401696	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Now where do we go ?
L401667	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'm not fucking him..
L401666	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
L401665	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
L401664	u6737	m449	BRUCE	You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
L401663	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
L401662	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Why should I ?
L401661	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
L401648	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	No !
L401647	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Leave him, he's dead.
L401646	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What about Matt ?
L401636	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
L401635	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Why should we trust you ?
L401600	u6737	m449	BRUCE	No time. Get him up.
L401599	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Where are we ?
L401582	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
L401581	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What's going on ?
L401580	u6737	m449	BRUCE	You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
L401981	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Don't have to tell me twice.
L401980	u6737	m449	BRUCE	He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
L401975	u6737	m449	BRUCE	In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
L401974	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Where ?
L401973	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
L401972	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Is it over ?
L401750	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Thanks...
L401749	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Knock yourself out.
L401748	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
L401741	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Ow...
L401740	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	You okay ?
L401737	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
L401736	u6737	m449	BRUCE	What the fuck are you talking about.
L401735	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Hey, try swimming. It works.
L401732	u6737	m449	BRUCE	That's cute asshole.
L401731	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
L401728	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Look...
L401727	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	That's not to tough.
L401724	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
L401723	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
L401722	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It's fine thanks.
L401719	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
L401718	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	An elevator ?
L401713	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
L401712	u6737	m449	BRUCE	The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
L401711	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Are you hunting wabbits ?
L401710	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Be very, very quiet...
L401709	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
L401708	u6737	m449	BRUCE	A dragon.
L401707	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	What's next Walt ?
L401699	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
L401698	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I thought you made this place ?
L401688	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Why ?
L401687	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I'd get out of the water if I were you.
L401686	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
L401680	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Not quite....
L401679	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Is it over ?
L401660	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Because of my charming personality ?
L401659	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
L401651	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I don't help criminals.
L401650	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
L401641	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	And that's different than this because...... ?
L401640	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
L401639	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
L401634	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
L401633	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
L401632	u6737	m449	BRUCE	NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
L401626	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I told him not to sit down in there.....
L401625	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
L401622	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Just shut the fuck up.
L401621	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
L401620	u6737	m449	BRUCE	NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
L401584	u6737	m449	BRUCE	43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
L401583	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
L401579	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Hey , Hey !
L401578	u6737	m449	BRUCE	That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
L401577	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
L401576	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Are you Matthew Parker ?
L401997	u6737	m449	BRUCE	For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
L401996	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
L401894	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
L401893	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
L401557	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Checking........
L401556	u6737	m449	BRUCE	A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
L401555	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Yeah, but we're talking 43.
L401554	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Parking tickets ? That's it ?
L401553	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
L401552	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Any priors ? Any police record ?
L401551	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
L401550	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
L401549	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	He probably has a history of this shit.
L401548	u6737	m449	BRUCE	He already had a balance of $600,000.
L401547	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	So ?
L401546	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
L401545	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I just want to double check the facts.
L401544	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	What's wrong ?
L401515	u6737	m449	BRUCE	That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
L401514	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	You did.
L401513	u6737	m449	BRUCE	And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
L401512	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
L401511	u6737	m449	BRUCE	No.
L401510	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
L401509	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
L401508	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
L401507	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Trust is earned not given away.
L401506	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
L401505	u6737	m449	BRUCE	When you are ready.
L401504	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	When will that be ?
L401503	u6737	m449	BRUCE	When I think you're ready.
L401502	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
L401501	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Hand me the 3/8ths.
L401404	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
L401403	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
L401394	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Got it.
L401393	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Stop the hydraulics.
L401392	u6737	m449	BRUCE	I said NO.
L401391	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	But, he's...
L401390	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Not yet.
L401389	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
L401386	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
L401385	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
L401382	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Yes, sir Mom. 
L401381	u6737	m449	BRUCE	It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
L401380	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	What ? Are you my mother ?
L401379	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Don't eat at the console.
L401378	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	What ?
L401377	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Don't.
L401376	u6737	m449	BRUCE	Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
L401375	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
L401433	u6738	m449	FRED THOMISON	We will start work on it now sir.
L401432	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
L401431	u6738	m449	FRED THOMISON	Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
L401430	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
L401429	u6738	m449	FRED THOMISON	Excuse me, sir ?
L401428	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Fire the whole division.
L401427	u6738	m449	FRED THOMISON	Well ?
L401820	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
L401819	u6743	m449	ZACH	Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
L401818	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
L401817	u6743	m449	ZACH	Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
L401816	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
L401815	u6743	m449	ZACH	Sir ?
L401814	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	One moment dear... 
L401813	u6743	m449	ZACH	Better, sir.
L401812	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Is it as good as I hope it is ?
L401811	u6743	m449	ZACH	Good, sir.
L401810	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
L401809	u6743	m449	ZACH	Zachary.
L401484	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
L401483	u6743	m449	ZACH	Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
L401482	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
L401481	u6743	m449	ZACH	John, sir.
L401480	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
L401479	u6743	m449	ZACH	What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
L401478	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
L401477	u6743	m449	ZACH	Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
L401476	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
L401475	u6743	m449	ZACH	Sir ?
L401474	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
L401473	u6743	m449	ZACH	What do you mean sir ?
L401472	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
L401471	u6743	m449	ZACH	Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
L401470	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	"That mail room kid was the longest lasting ""guest"" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another ""guest"" from the more athletic of our staff."
L401469	u6743	m449	ZACH	"Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the ""park"" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing."
L401468	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	"What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the ""Park"" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?"
L401467	u6743	m449	ZACH	"That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested ""guests""."
L401466	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	"I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the ""guests"" being of the more nefarious type."
L401465	u6743	m449	ZACH	"But sir, most of the people we are putting into the ""Park"" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess."
L401464	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
L401463	u6743	m449	ZACH	"I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the ""guests"" might take longer to expire."
L401462	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	That was rather.... disappointing.
L401461	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Son, let's watch the tape.
L401460	u6743	m449	ZACH	Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
L401459	u6743	m449	ZACH	Thank you, sir.
L401458	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
L401457	u6743	m449	ZACH	Yes sir.
L401456	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
L401455	u6743	m449	ZACH	I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
L401454	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	And how much do we pay you annually ?
L401453	u6743	m449	ZACH	I am thirty two.
L401452	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Zach, how old are you, son ?
L401451	u6743	m449	ZACH	"While I am not morally against these little, shall we say ""hobbies"", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?"
L401450	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Of course.
L401449	u6743	m449	ZACH	Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
L401448	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
L401447	u6743	m449	ZACH	Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
L401446	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
L401445	u6743	m449	ZACH	I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
L401444	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
L401443	u6743	m449	ZACH	Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
L401442	u6739	m449	JOHN C. MCCAY	Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
L401944	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
L401943	u6743	m449	ZACH	Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
L401942	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
L401941	u6743	m449	ZACH	How can this happen ?
L401940	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	The power went out in half the park.
L401939	u6743	m449	ZACH	What happened ?
L401938	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	What the ... ?
L401916	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
L401915	u6743	m449	ZACH	So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
L401906	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I think I'll see hat action.
L401905	u6743	m449	ZACH	Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
L401892	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
L401891	u6743	m449	ZACH	Thank you very much.
L401885	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
L401884	u6743	m449	ZACH	Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
L401883	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	<<belch>>
L401882	u6743	m449	ZACH	That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
L401824	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I can see that but where ?
L401823	u6743	m449	ZACH	There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
L401822	u6743	m449	ZACH	Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
L401821	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Was that the Old Man ?
L401783	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	You're paying the bills.
L401782	u6743	m449	ZACH	I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
L401781	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
L401780	u6743	m449	ZACH	Look ! Look !
L401773	u6743	m449	ZACH	I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
L401772	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Look he figured it out !
L401757	u6743	m449	ZACH	Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
L401756	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Maybe you should get over fears.
L401706	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
L401705	u6743	m449	ZACH	Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
L401695	u6743	m449	ZACH	I'll see that bet.
L401694	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
L401655	u6743	m449	ZACH	I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
L401654	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I have a turn for the worse for the team !
L401653	u6743	m449	ZACH	What's next ?
L401638	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
L401637	u6743	m449	ZACH	Will he make it out ?
L401618	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
L401617	u6743	m449	ZACH	We can't afford too many surprises.
L401616	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
L401615	u6743	m449	ZACH	What was that ?
L401614	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I don't know.....
L401613	u6743	m449	ZACH	What is Bruce doing ?
L401596	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	What ?????
L401595	u6743	m449	ZACH	Bruce has just awaken.
L401594	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
L401593	u6743	m449	ZACH	How long till the drug wears off ?
L401592	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Aren't you the bitter one.
L401591	u6743	m449	ZACH	Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
L401590	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	So who are these people with the Boss ?
L401538	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I'm listening.
L401537	u6743	m449	ZACH	I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
L401536	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	No I am not.
L401535	u6743	m449	ZACH	Are you happy with your salary and position ?
L401534	u6743	m449	ZACH	We can't.
L401533	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	"I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new ""Park""."
L401532	u6743	m449	ZACH	"Have you ever considered running your own ""Park"" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession."
L401531	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Then what do you want ?
L401530	u6743	m449	ZACH	No. I am not a homosexual.
L401529	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
L401528	u6743	m449	ZACH	I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
L401527	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
L401526	u6743	m449	ZACH	Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
L401525	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	I was.
L401524	u6743	m449	ZACH	Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
L401523	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	What did you hear ?
L401522	u6743	m449	ZACH	No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
L401521	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	He's been expecting you.
L401520	u6743	m449	ZACH	"We have new ""guests"" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?"
L401519	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
L401398	u6743	m449	ZACH	I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
L401397	u6740	m449	JOHNNY	He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
L402044	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I'm going to go ahead and go now.
L402043	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Why don't you shut up now.
L402042	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
L402040	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	"Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  ""Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?"" or ""You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought""."
L402039	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	No.
L402038	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
L402037	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
L402036	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Hey buddy. You okay ?
L402035	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
L402027	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Who was that guy anyway ?
L402026	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	He was right behind me !
L402023	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Come to the rescue again I see.
L402022	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
L402006	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Where are we ?
L402005	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
L402004	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I want to go to sleep for about a month.
L402003	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What now ?
L402002	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	We made it !
L402001	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
L402000	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
L401999	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
L401994	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'm fine.
L401993	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
L401979	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Zach from work ?
L401978	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
L401967	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Nothing.
L401966	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What ?
L401965	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
L401964	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Shut up ! It's me.
L401963	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
L401721	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	How's your foot ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
L401720	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	How's your foot ?
L401669	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	We just having our first date when you showed up.
L401668	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	You don't have to sound so emphatic.
L401658	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
L401657	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I'm talking to you asshole !
L401631	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Which one, this door is locked !
L401630	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
L401628	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
L401627	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Are you okay ?
L401624	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I just need to sit and think for a second.
L401623	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I think we should follow him...
L401611	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	What the hell kind of cop are you ?
L401610	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
L401605	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	No ! Just get up. This is serious.
L401604	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Hey... did we uhm, you know....
L401603	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Wake up, we're in trouble.
L401602	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Not now, Mom.
L401575	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Yahoo !!!!!
L401574	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
L401573	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
L401572	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
L401571	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
L401570	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
L401569	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
L401568	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
L401567	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
L401566	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
L401565	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Yes, Excuse me for a second.
L401564	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Are you okay ?
L401563	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Thank you.
L401562	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	What an incredible view !
L401561	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Thanks.
L401560	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Thank you, won't you come in ?
L401559	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Hi. I brought some wine.
L401558	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Hello.
L401496	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Sure.
L401495	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
L401494	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	As appealing as that sounds...
L401493	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
L401492	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Yes.
L401491	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Really ? On a date ?
L401490	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Yes.
L401489	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
L401488	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Do you want to go out with me ?
L401487	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
L401486	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
L401485	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
L401423	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Excuse me, gentlemen
L401422	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
L401421	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	I meant him.
L401420	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Thank you.
L401419	u6741	m449	MATTHEW	Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
L401439	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
L401438	u6743	m449	ZACH	Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
L401437	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
L401436	u6743	m449	ZACH	We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
L401417	u6743	m449	ZACH	Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
L401416	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
L401415	u6743	m449	ZACH	I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
L401414	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
L401413	u6743	m449	ZACH	Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
L401412	u6742	m449	SAUNDRA	Good morning.
L401411	u6743	m449	ZACH	Good morning.
L410072	u6840	m456	OMAR	Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
L410071	u6838	m456	DANNY	Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
L410050	u6840	m456	OMAR	Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
L410049	u6838	m456	DANNY	Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
L410048	u6840	m456	OMAR	I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
L410040	u6840	m456	OMAR	No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
L410039	u6838	m456	DANNY	Omar, listen to me--
L410038	u6840	m456	OMAR	I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
L410037	u6838	m456	DANNY	She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
L410036	u6840	m456	OMAR	Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
L410035	u6838	m456	DANNY	Omar--
L410034	u6840	m456	OMAR	Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
L410033	u6838	m456	DANNY	Your Raoul?
L410032	u6840	m456	OMAR	Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
L410031	u6838	m456	DANNY	You hate Raoul?
L410030	u6840	m456	OMAR	I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
L410068	u6839	m456	NATHAN	Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
L410067	u6838	m456	DANNY	We got any shots?
L410064	u6839	m456	NATHAN	Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
L410063	u6838	m456	DANNY	I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
L410062	u6839	m456	NATHAN	So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
L410061	u6838	m456	DANNY	I'm still on my honeymoon.
L410060	u6839	m456	NATHAN	How long's it been?
L410059	u6839	m456	NATHAN	Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
L410058	u6838	m456	DANNY	Since when?
L410057	u6839	m456	NATHAN	Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
L410054	u6839	m456	NATHAN	Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
L410053	u6838	m456	DANNY	That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
L410052	u6839	m456	NATHAN	Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
L454272	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
L454271	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
L454270	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
L454269	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
L454268	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. I told you, she's confined...
L454267	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
L454266	u7177	m482	NORMAN	That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
L454265	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
L454264	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
L454263	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
L454262	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Now, look...!
L454261	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	If she paid you well?
L454260	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Of course not.
L454259	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
L454258	u7177	m482	NORMAN	She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
L454257	u7177	m482	NORMAN	My mother.
L454256	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Someone is sitting in that window.
L454255	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I live there. Alone.
L454254	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Anyone at home?
L454253	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
L454251	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
L454250	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
L454249	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Not at all!
L454248	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She isn't still here, is she?
L454247	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
L454246	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
L454245	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
L454244	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	And when she left, she never came back.
L454243	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Cash.
L454242	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Cash or check? For the cabin...
L454241	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What?
L454240	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	How did she pay you?
L454239	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
L454238	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	"You said she was sitting ""back there,"" or standing rather..."
L454237	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What do you mean?
L454236	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Back where?
L454235	u7177	m482	NORMAN	She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
L454234	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	How do you know she didn't make a call?
L454233	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No! Of all...
L454232	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
L454231	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No.
L454230	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
L454229	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No.
L454228	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Or arrived with her.
L454227	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No.
L454226	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	No one met her?
L454225	u7177	m482	NORMAN	The following morning. Sunday.
L454224	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Of which morning?
L454223	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Very early. Dawn.
L454222	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	How early?
L454221	u7177	m482	NORMAN	She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
L454220	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Tell me all about her.
L454219	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
L454218	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
L454217	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	"Don't know where she got ""Marie,"" but ""Samuels"" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?"
L454214	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
L454213	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What?
L454212	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
L454210	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
L454209	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
L454208	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. At least I don't recall.
L454207	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Look at the picture. Please.
L454206	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
L454205	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
L454204	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
L454203	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
L454202	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh.
L454201	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I'm not the police.
L454200	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
L454199	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
L454198	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
L454197	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	No.
L454196	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You out to buy a motel?
L454195	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
L454194	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
L454193	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
L454192	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
L454191	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
L454167	u7180	m482	SAM	I don't believe it.  Do you?
L454166	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
L454165	u7180	m482	SAM	Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
L454154	u7180	m482	SAM	What are you talking about?  What is this?
L454153	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Must've needed it.
L454152	u7180	m482	SAM	Why?
L454151	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
L454150	u7180	m482	SAM	Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
L454149	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Money.
L454148	u7180	m482	SAM	What's your interest?
L454145	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
L454144	u7180	m482	SAM	Who are you, friend?
L454143	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Let's all talk about Mary.
L454164	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
L454163	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
L454162	u7173	m482	LILA	Not even a hunch. Just hope.
L454161	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
L454159	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, if she's here...
L454158	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Casharoonie!
L454157	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
L454156	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
L454147	u7169	m482	ARBOGAST	Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
L454146	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't know.
L453978	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Okay. If you'll come along...
L453977	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
L453976	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
L453975	u7175	m482	MARY	But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
L453974	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
L453973	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
L453972	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
L453971	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
L453970	u7175	m482	MARY	I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
L453969	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
L453968	u7175	m482	MARY	All right.
L453967	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
L453966	u7175	m482	MARY	Five hundred.
L453965	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
L453964	u7175	m482	MARY	Of course not. Please.
L453963	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
L453962	u7175	m482	MARY	It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
L453961	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
L453960	u7175	m482	MARY	How much?
L453959	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
L453957	u7175	m482	MARY	No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
L453956	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
L453955	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
L453954	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
L453953	u7175	m482	MARY	Can I trade in my car and take another?
L453952	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	"There's an old saying, ""First customer of the day is always the most trouble!"" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me..."
L453951	u7175	m482	MARY	What?
L453950	u7170	m482	CAR DEALER	I'm in no mood for trouble!
L453924	u7175	m482	MARY	I don't need pills... just sleep.
L453923	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
L453897	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
L453896	u7175	m482	MARY	Were there any calls?
L453895	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
L453894	u7175	m482	MARY	It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
L453893	u7171	m482	CAROLINE	He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
L453892	u7175	m482	MARY	Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
L453992	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
L453991	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
L453990	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
L453989	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
L453988	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	Buzz me the minute she comes in.
L453987	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
L453986	u7174	m482	LOWERY'S VOICE	Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
L453985	u7172	m482	CAROLINE'S VOICE	Yes, Mr. Lowery.
L454413	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't know.
L454412	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
L454411	u7173	m482	LILA	I still feel...
L454408	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Just what he told your detective.
L454407	u7173	m482	LILA	Did he say anything about my sister?
L454383	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
L454382	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454379	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
L454378	u7173	m482	LILA	What difference does that...
L454377	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
L454373	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
L454372	u7173	m482	LILA	Please!
L454359	u7173	m482	LILA	He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
L454358	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
L454357	u7173	m482	LILA	Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
L454356	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Like what?
L454355	u7173	m482	LILA	He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
L454354	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	With the forty thousand dollars?
L454353	u7173	m482	LILA	Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
L454350	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	And the police haven't been able to...
L454349	u7173	m482	LILA	Forty thousand dollars.
L454348	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	A lot?
L454347	u7173	m482	LILA	She stole some money.
L454344	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
L454343	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454340	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
L454339	u7173	m482	LILA	She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
L454338	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Now. Your sister is missing how long?
L454337	u7173	m482	LILA	Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
L454522	u7173	m482	LILA	I could stand something regular.
L454521	u7180	m482	SAM	It's regular. Okay?
L454483	u7180	m482	SAM	Bates.
L454482	u7173	m482	LILA	Why not?
L454481	u7180	m482	SAM	You can't go up there.
L454480	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
L454479	u7180	m482	SAM	Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
L454478	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
L454477	u7180	m482	SAM	Bates never denied Mary was here.
L454476	u7173	m482	LILA	That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
L454475	u7173	m482	LILA	It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
L454474	u7180	m482	SAM	What is it?
L454473	u7173	m482	LILA	The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
L454472	u7180	m482	SAM	What?
L454471	u7173	m482	LILA	Hospital clean.
L454470	u7180	m482	SAM	Sorry.
L454466	u7173	m482	LILA	Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
L454465	u7180	m482	SAM	What makes you sound so certain?
L454464	u7173	m482	LILA	There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
L454463	u7180	m482	SAM	How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
L454462	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
L454461	u7180	m482	SAM	I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
L454460	u7173	m482	LILA	We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
L454459	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm glad we didn't.
L454458	u7173	m482	LILA	We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
L454441	u7173	m482	LILA	Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
L454440	u7180	m482	SAM	I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
L454439	u7173	m482	LILA	I believe it.
L454438	u7180	m482	SAM	You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
L454437	u7173	m482	LILA	We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
L454436	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
L454435	u7173	m482	LILA	You going to wait here for me?
L454434	u7180	m482	SAM	She always tries to be proper.
L454433	u7173	m482	LILA	Huh?
L454432	u7180	m482	SAM	Watch your tenses.
L454431	u7173	m482	LILA	I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
L454430	u7180	m482	SAM	This is the old highway.
L454429	u7173	m482	LILA	Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
L454428	u7180	m482	SAM	We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
L454427	u7173	m482	LILA	I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
L454426	u7180	m482	SAM	She was willing to lick the stamps.
L454425	u7173	m482	LILA	I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
L454424	u7180	m482	SAM	Where'd you go to college?
L454422	u7173	m482	LILA	Alive.
L454421	u7180	m482	SAM	Of course we will.
L454420	u7173	m482	LILA	I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
L454419	u7180	m482	SAM	Neither will I.
L454418	u7173	m482	LILA	I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
L454416	u7173	m482	LILA	You're not.
L454415	u7180	m482	SAM	Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
L454367	u7173	m482	LILA	All right! Then call! At least, call!
L454366	u7180	m482	SAM	I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
L454330	u7180	m482	SAM	This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
L454329	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454328	u7180	m482	SAM	I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
L454327	u7173	m482	LILA	No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
L454319	u7180	m482	SAM	No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
L454318	u7173	m482	LILA	Does that mean we can't...
L454317	u7180	m482	SAM	Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
L454316	u7173	m482	LILA	Well?
L454315	u7180	m482	SAM	Our Deputy sleeps.
L454314	u7180	m482	SAM	He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
L454313	u7173	m482	LILA	Who's he?
L454312	u7180	m482	SAM	Let's go see Al Chambers.
L454311	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes. I think he would have.
L454310	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
L454309	u7180	m482	SAM	In a hurry.
L454308	u7173	m482	LILA	Without calling me?
L454307	u7180	m482	SAM	Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
L454306	u7173	m482	LILA	Where could he have gone?
L454305	u7180	m482	SAM	No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
L454304	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam.
L454303	u7180	m482	SAM	He didn't come back here?
L454301	u7180	m482	SAM	Contemplate your... panic button.
L454300	u7173	m482	LILA	Just wait here?
L454299	u7180	m482	SAM	I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
L454298	u7173	m482	LILA	Why can't I go out there with you?
L454297	u7180	m482	SAM	Stay here.
L454296	u7180	m482	SAM	You'll never find it.
L454295	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam, I'm going.
L454294	u7180	m482	SAM	Probably on his way back right now.
L454293	u7180	m482	SAM	And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
L454292	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam! Why call when we can go?
L454291	u7180	m482	SAM	Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
L454290	u7173	m482	LILA	An hour! Or less!
L454289	u7180	m482	SAM	Arbogast said...
L454288	u7173	m482	LILA	Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
L454287	u7180	m482	SAM	That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
L454286	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454285	u7180	m482	SAM	You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
L454284	u7173	m482	LILA	Where's the old highway?
L454283	u7180	m482	SAM	I feel better when you feel better.
L454282	u7173	m482	LILA	Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
L454281	u7180	m482	SAM	Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
L454280	u7173	m482	LILA	You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
L454279	u7180	m482	SAM	He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
L454278	u7173	m482	LILA	Are we just going to go on sitting here?
L454277	u7180	m482	SAM	It's been three.
L454276	u7173	m482	LILA	Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
L454275	u7180	m482	SAM	Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
L454190	u7180	m482	SAM	First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
L454189	u7173	m482	LILA	Where... can I stay?
L454188	u7180	m482	SAM	She'll need both of us.
L454187	u7173	m482	LILA	You want me to stay here?
L454186	u7180	m482	SAM	I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
L454185	u7173	m482	LILA	I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
L454184	u7180	m482	SAM	Maybe we can handle it together. 
L454183	u7173	m482	LILA	No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
L454182	u7180	m482	SAM	You've led a charmed life.
L454181	u7173	m482	LILA	I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
L454180	u7180	m482	SAM	I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
L454179	u7173	m482	LILA	She haven't even called you?
L454178	u7180	m482	SAM	How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
L454177	u7173	m482	LILA	Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
L454176	u7180	m482	SAM	No.
L454175	u7173	m482	LILA	I ought to call the police right now!
L454174	u7180	m482	SAM	He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
L454173	u7173	m482	LILA	No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
L454172	u7180	m482	SAM	It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
L454171	u7173	m482	LILA	I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
L454169	u7180	m482	SAM	You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
L454168	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
L454142	u7180	m482	SAM	Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
L454141	u7173	m482	LILA	Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
L454140	u7180	m482	SAM	Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
L454139	u7173	m482	LILA	Yes.
L454138	u7180	m482	SAM	Is Mary... in trouble?
L454137	u7173	m482	LILA	I hate tears. 
L454136	u7180	m482	SAM	What thing could we be in together?
L454135	u7173	m482	LILA	Huh?
L454134	u7180	m482	SAM	What thing?
L454130	u7173	m482	LILA	Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
L454129	u7180	m482	SAM	Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
L454128	u7173	m482	LILA	What do you know about it?
L454127	u7180	m482	SAM	I was getting to that!
L454126	u7173	m482	LILA	Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
L454125	u7180	m482	SAM	Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
L454124	u7173	m482	LILA	A good reason, I suppose.
L454123	u7180	m482	SAM	And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
L454122	u7173	m482	LILA	Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
L454121	u7180	m482	SAM	No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
L454120	u7173	m482	LILA	To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
L454119	u7180	m482	SAM	What should I know?
L454117	u7173	m482	LILA	Don't you know?
L454116	u7180	m482	SAM	What's the matter?
L454115	u7173	m482	LILA	I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
L454114	u7180	m482	SAM	Where?
L454113	u7173	m482	LILA	With you.
L454112	u7180	m482	SAM	Here?
L454111	u7173	m482	LILA	I want to know if my sister is here.
L454110	u7180	m482	SAM	Is something wrong?
L454109	u7173	m482	LILA	Is Mary here?
L454108	u7180	m482	SAM	Lila.
L454107	u7173	m482	LILA	I'm Mary's sister.
L454106	u7180	m482	SAM	Sure...
L454105	u7173	m482	LILA	May I talk to you?
L454104	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes?
L453891	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
L453890	u7180	m482	SAM	Hey, we can leave together can't we?
L453889	u7175	m482	MARY	Don't miss your plane.
L453888	u7180	m482	SAM	How can you even think a thing like that!
L453887	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm thinking of it.
L453886	u7180	m482	SAM	You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
L453885	u7175	m482	MARY	I'll lick the stamps.
L453884	u7180	m482	SAM	And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
L453883	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam, let's go get married.
L453882	u7180	m482	SAM	Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
L453881	u7175	m482	MARY	I haven't even been married once yet!
L453880	u7180	m482	SAM	A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
L453879	u7175	m482	MARY	I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
L453878	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
L453877	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
L453876	u7175	m482	MARY	You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
L453875	u7180	m482	SAM	Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
L453874	u7180	m482	SAM	All right.
L453873	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam! No!
L453872	u7180	m482	SAM	And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
L453871	u7175	m482	MARY	We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
L453870	u7180	m482	SAM	Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
L453869	u7175	m482	MARY	No.
L453868	u7180	m482	SAM	I can come down next week.
L453867	u7175	m482	MARY	I have to go, Sam.
L453866	u7180	m482	SAM	I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
L453865	u7175	m482	MARY	You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
L453864	u7180	m482	SAM	And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
L453863	u7180	m482	SAM	Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
L453862	u7175	m482	MARY	Can you?
L453861	u7180	m482	SAM	You can't laugh at it, huh?
L453860	u7175	m482	MARY	It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
L453859	u7180	m482	SAM	And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
L453858	u7175	m482	MARY	I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
L453857	u7180	m482	SAM	Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
L453856	u7175	m482	MARY	This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
L453855	u7180	m482	SAM	For what?
L453854	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam. This is the last time.
L453853	u7180	m482	SAM	The only girlish thing you have lost.
L453852	u7175	m482	MARY	I've lost my girlish laughter.
L453851	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
L453850	u7175	m482	MARY	Sam!
L453849	u7180	m482	SAM	You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
L453848	u7175	m482	MARY	When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
L453847	u7180	m482	SAM	I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
L453846	u7175	m482	MARY	Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
L453845	u7180	m482	SAM	We could laze around here a while longer.
L453844	u7175	m482	MARY	What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
L453843	u7180	m482	SAM	Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
L454097	u7175	m482	MARY	Good night.
L454096	u7177	m482	NORMAN	That's it. 
L454095	u7175	m482	MARY	Crane.
L454094	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Alright, Miss... 
L454093	u7175	m482	MARY	Very early. Dawn.
L454092	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
L454091	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd like to, but...
L454090	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
L454089	u7175	m482	MARY	I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
L454088	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Phoenix?
L454087	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
L454086	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You're not going to... to your room already?
L454085	u7175	m482	MARY	Norman.
L454084	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Thank you, Norman.
L454083	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
L454082	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
L454081	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
L454080	u7175	m482	MARY	I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
L454079	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
L454078	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
L454077	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse ""someplace.""  Put her in Someplace!"
L454076	u7175	m482	MARY	Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
L454075	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
L454074	u7175	m482	MARY	No, not like me.
L454073	u7177	m482	NORMAN	To a private island, like you?
L454072	u7175	m482	MARY	Why don't you go away?
L454071	u7177	m482	NORMAN	A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
L454070	u7175	m482	MARY	Except you.
L454069	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
L454068	u7175	m482	MARY	She sounded strong...
L454067	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
L454066	u7175	m482	MARY	If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
L454065	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
L454064	u7175	m482	MARY	You should... mind it.
L454063	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
L454062	u7175	m482	MARY	Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
L454061	u7177	m482	NORMAN	No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
L454060	u7175	m482	MARY	Why do you ask that?
L454059	u7177	m482	NORMAN	What are you running away from?
L454058	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm looking for a private island.
L454057	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
L454056	u7175	m482	MARY	Only my share.
L454055	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
L454054	u7175	m482	MARY	You go out... with friends?
L454053	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
L454052	u7175	m482	MARY	Is your time so empty?
L454051	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
L454050	u7175	m482	MARY	A man should have a hobby.
L454049	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
L454048	u7175	m482	MARY	I imagine so.
L454047	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Uncommon, too.
L454046	u7175	m482	MARY	It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
L454045	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats ""like a bird,"" is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them..."
L454044	u7175	m482	MARY	You'd know, of course.
L454043	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You eat like a bird.
L454042	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
L454041	u7175	m482	MARY	You're very... kind.
L454037	u7175	m482	MARY	Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
L454036	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
L454035	u7175	m482	MARY	You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
L454034	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"Mother...  ...what is the phrase... ""she isn't herself today""... I think that's it."
L454033	u7175	m482	MARY	I've caused you some trouble.
L454024	u7177	m482	NORMAN	All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
L454023	u7175	m482	MARY	I'd like to.
L454022	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
L454021	u7175	m482	MARY	No.
L454020	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
L454019	u7175	m482	MARY	Thank you. Again.
L454018	u7177	m482	NORMAN	There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
L454017	u7175	m482	MARY	I have?
L454016	u7177	m482	NORMAN	You have something most girls never have.
L454015	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Norman Bates.
L454014	u7175	m482	MARY	Thank you, Mr. Bates.
L454013	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
L454012	u7175	m482	MARY	The bathroom.
L454011	u7177	m482	NORMAN	"Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with ""Bates' Motel"" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... "
L454010	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
L454009	u7175	m482	MARY	Am I that close to Fairvale?
L454008	u7177	m482	NORMAN	There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
L454007	u7175	m482	MARY	I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
L454005	u7175	m482	MARY	Los Angeles.
L454004	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
L454002	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
L454001	u7175	m482	MARY	I thought I'd gotten off the main...
L454000	u7177	m482	NORMAN	We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
L453999	u7175	m482	MARY	You have a vacancy?
L453998	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Dirty night.
L453948	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Please.
L453947	u7175	m482	MARY	Why?
L453946	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	May I see your license?
L453945	u7175	m482	MARY	Now what?
L453944	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Wait a minute!
L453943	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	No need to apologize...
L453942	u7175	m482	MARY	I'm sorry.
L453941	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	"In the course of my duty, I never ""take up"" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest..."
L453940	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
L453939	u7175	m482	MARY	Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
L453938	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Is there?
L453937	u7175	m482	MARY	Please... I'd like to go...
L453936	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Frankly, yes.
L453935	u7175	m482	MARY	Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
L453934	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	Is anything wrong?
L453933	u7175	m482	MARY	Then I'm free to go...?
L453932	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	No, m'am.
L453931	u7175	m482	MARY	I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
L453930	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
L453929	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
L453928	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	You slept here all night?
L453927	u7175	m482	MARY	Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
L453926	u7179	m482	PATROLMAN	In quite a hurry.
L454402	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	He's already been.
L454401	u7180	m482	SAM	We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
L454389	u7180	m482	SAM	I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
L454388	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Maybe you saw Mary!
L454387	u7180	m482	SAM	You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
L454336	u7180	m482	SAM	No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
L454335	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Norman took a wife?
L454334	u7180	m482	SAM	He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
L454333	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
L454332	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
L454331	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Mary is Lila's sister?
L454326	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
L454325	u7180	m482	SAM	We have a problem.
L454322	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
L454321	u7180	m482	SAM	Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
L454320	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Oh?
L454404	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Have you two had breakfast?
L454403	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Went out before service.
L454386	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
L454385	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
L454384	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
L454381	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
L454380	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Barefaced.
L454371	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
L454370	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Arbogast.
L454369	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
L454365	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
L454364	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Recluse. Kinder word.
L454361	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	At this hour?
L454360	u7176	m482	MRS. CHAMBERS	Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
L454513	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Leave me alone!
L454512	u7180	m482	SAM	...Forty thousand dollars!
L454511	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Leave me alone!
L454510	u7180	m482	SAM	Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
L454509	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Shut up!
L454508	u7180	m482	SAM	Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
L454507	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Do what?
L454506	u7180	m482	SAM	I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
L454505	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I don't know what you've been saying.
L454504	u7180	m482	SAM	You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
L454503	u7180	m482	SAM	I didn't think so.
L454502	u7177	m482	NORMAN	My mother is not dead!
L454501	u7180	m482	SAM	And now that your mother's dead?
L454500	u7177	m482	NORMAN	This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
L454499	u7180	m482	SAM	I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
L454497	u7180	m482	SAM	Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
L454496	u7177	m482	NORMAN	That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
L454495	u7180	m482	SAM	I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
L454494	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Yes.
L454493	u7180	m482	SAM	I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
L454492	u7180	m482	SAM	Fine.
L454491	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Satisfied with your cabin?
L454490	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
L454489	u7177	m482	NORMAN	Looking for me?
L454452	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll show you the cabin.
L454451	u7180	m482	SAM	Haven't any.
L454450	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll get your bags.
L454449	u7180	m482	SAM	Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
L454448	u7177	m482	NORMAN	It isn't necessary.
L454447	u7180	m482	SAM	Better sign in first, hasn't we?
L454446	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I'll take you to...
L454445	u7180	m482	SAM	We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
L454444	u7177	m482	NORMAN	I suppose you want a cabin.
L454443	u7180	m482	SAM	Just coming up to ring for you.
L454032	u7178	m482	NORMAN'S VOICE	Shut up! Shut up!
L454031	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
L454030	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
L454029	u7178	m482	NORMAN'S VOICE	Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
L454028	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
L454027	u7178	m482	NORMAN'S VOICE	Mother, please...
L454026	u7182	m482	WOMAN'S VOICE	I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
L454410	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
L454409	u7180	m482	SAM	No mother.
L454406	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
L454405	u7180	m482	SAM	You didn't find anything.
L454392	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
L454391	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
L454390	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
L454375	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
L454374	u7180	m482	SAM	Was that all?
L454363	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
L454362	u7180	m482	SAM	He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
L454352	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
L454351	u7180	m482	SAM	Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
L454346	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	From what?
L454345	u7180	m482	SAM	Yes.
L454342	u7181	m482	SHERIFF	Left Phoenix under her own steam?
L454341	u7180	m482	SAM	They thought she'd be coming to me.
L458287	u7212	m485	SPARROW	It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
L458286	u7201	m485	CAPTAIN	You lie!
L458285	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
L458284	u7201	m485	CAPTAIN	But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
L458283	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
L458282	u7201	m485	CAPTAIN	You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
L458010	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
L458009	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I think so.
L457999	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
L457998	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
L457997	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
L457996	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
L457995	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
L457994	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
L457993	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
L457992	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Why didn't you eat last night?
L457991	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
L457990	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	There's no hurry. It's early.
L457924	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'll have it for supper.  So long.
L457923	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But what about lunch?
L457876	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
L457875	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
L457874	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
L457873	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	You would.
L457872	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
L457871	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I don't agree with you.
L457870	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
L457869	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
L457868	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
L457844	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
L457843	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Did you? Where?
L457842	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
L457841	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
L457840	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
L457839	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	What are you laughing at?
L457838	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
L457837	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
L457836	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Yes, why?
L458071	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
L458070	u7210	m485	RALPH	That's the way I feel about it.
L458069	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	So that's the way it is?
L458068	u7210	m485	RALPH	Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
L458067	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'd call it stupid at any time.
L458066	u7210	m485	RALPH	You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
L458061	u7210	m485	RALPH	I'm not quarreling, only ...
L458060	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
L458059	u7210	m485	RALPH	Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
L458058	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
L458057	u7210	m485	RALPH	Well, I do say it.
L458056	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I won't let you say that!
L458055	u7210	m485	RALPH	What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
L458054	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
L458053	u7210	m485	RALPH	She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
L458052	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But why? She's the best friend I've got.
L457911	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Delighted, I'm sure. 
L457910	u7210	m485	RALPH	Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
L457892	u7210	m485	RALPH	Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
L457891	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
L458291	u7208	m485	IGOR	And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
L458290	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
L458258	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Ralph! Ralph!
L458257	u7208	m485	IGOR	We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
L458256	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Let me go! Let me go!
L458250	u7208	m485	IGOR	It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
L458249	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
L458248	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'd love to.
L458247	u7208	m485	IGOR	And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
L458246	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But it was really my fault.
L458245	u7208	m485	IGOR	Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
L458244	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
L458243	u7208	m485	IGOR	Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
L458242	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
L458022	u7208	m485	IGOR	They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
L458021	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	But I think these things are beautiful.
L457918	u7208	m485	IGOR	At any time. You will always be welcome.
L457917	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	We'll be coming to the opening.
L457915	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	I'd love to, at any time.
L457914	u7208	m485	IGOR	Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
L457913	u7202	m485	CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
L457912	u7208	m485	IGOR	If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
L458162	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
L458161	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
L458133	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
L458132	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	You mean he was colored?
L458131	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
L458122	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
L458121	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	It happens that I'm the law.
L458120	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
L458119	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	What do you think I am?
L458118	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
L458113	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
L458112	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	Are you giving me this straight?
L458111	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
L458110	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
L458109	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	The body of Joan Gale!
L458108	u7203	m485	DETECTIVE	What! What are you talking about?
L458337	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
L458336	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That's what I said.
L458332	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
L458331	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
L458218	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
L458217	u7204	m485	EDITOR	What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
L458216	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
L458215	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
L458214	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
L458213	u7204	m485	EDITOR	What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
L458212	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
L458211	u7204	m485	EDITOR	You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
L458210	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
L457971	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
L457970	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Almost certain.
L457969	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No kiddin'?
L457968	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
L457967	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What do you mean?
L457966	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
L457965	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
L457964	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
L457963	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Let it go.
L457962	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
L457961	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
L457960	u7204	m485	EDITOR	I used to be married to one.
L457959	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
L457958	u7204	m485	EDITOR	About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
L457957	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What!
L457956	u7204	m485	EDITOR	We'll grant that.
L457955	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
L457954	u7204	m485	EDITOR	No kiddin'. What's your idea?
L457953	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
L457952	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
L457951	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I asked you to keep your trap shut!
L457950	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Now don't that call for an extra!
L457949	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
L457948	u7204	m485	EDITOR	All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
L457947	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
L457946	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
L457945	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I am right! I know I'm right!
L457942	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
L457941	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
L457938	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
L457937	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
L457936	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
L457790	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Get out of here.
L457789	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Which one is me? The horse?
L457786	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
L457785	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No, there's another point I want to iron out.
L457784	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
L457783	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
L457781	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Nope, I'm through!
L457780	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
L457779	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
L457778	u7204	m485	EDITOR	You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
L457777	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
L457776	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
L457775	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
L457774	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
L457773	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	And they never proved anything against him.
L457772	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
L457771	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
L457770	u7204	m485	EDITOR	You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
L457769	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
L457768	u7204	m485	EDITOR	I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
L457767	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	You give me a pain!
L457766	u7204	m485	EDITOR	He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
L457765	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
L457764	u7204	m485	EDITOR	And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
L457763	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
L457762	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
L457761	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
L457760	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
L457635	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
L457634	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
L457633	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
L457631	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
L457630	u7204	m485	EDITOR	All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
L457629	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
L457628	u7204	m485	EDITOR	I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
L457625	u7204	m485	EDITOR	That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
L457624	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Meaning what?
L457623	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
L457622	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Charming. More delightful people crippled.
L457621	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
L457620	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
L457619	u7204	m485	EDITOR	Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
L457618	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
L458231	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
L458230	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
L458229	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
L458228	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
L458225	u7212	m485	SPARROW	No, sir. About three months ago.
L458224	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	Don't remember what day that was, do you?
L458223	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I don't remember. Not so very far--
L458222	u7205	m485	FIRST DETECTIVE	Where were you going when you got in that cab?
L458221	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
L457676	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Thanks.
L457675	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	It's all yours.
L457674	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
L457673	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
L457672	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Make it snappy, Colonel.
L457668	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Hotcha! Saved, one job!
L457667	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
L457666	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What does that prove?
L457665	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
L457664	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
L457663	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
L457662	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
L457661	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	That's the one.
L457660	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Old Howard Winton's cub?
L457659	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Do you know George Winton?
L457658	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No foolin' -- any suspect?
L457657	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
L457656	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
L457655	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
L457654	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
L457653	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	No kiddin'.
L457652	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
L457651	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
L457650	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	How's every little thing?
L457649	u7211	m485	SERGEANT	Call the Homicide Squad!
L457640	u7209	m485	MAN	Here's a wow.
L457639	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
L457638	u7209	m485	MAN	I told you he was a sore.
L457616	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
L457615	u7209	m485	MAN	Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
L457614	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
L457613	u7209	m485	MAN	What do you mean police dog?
L457612	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
L457611	u7209	m485	MAN	Where'd you get the stag hound?
L458278	u7210	m485	RALPH	Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
L458277	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
L458268	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
L458267	u7210	m485	RALPH	Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
L458266	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
L458265	u7210	m485	RALPH	I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
L458264	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
L458263	u7210	m485	RALPH	What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
L457901	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Horsefeathers!
L457900	u7210	m485	RALPH	Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
L457899	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
L457898	u7210	m485	RALPH	No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
L457897	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	He might get some publicity out of it.
L457890	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
L457889	u7210	m485	RALPH	Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
L457888	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Fine, thanks.
L458309	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
L458308	u7213	m485	WINTON	What is it? What happened?
L458206	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
L458205	u7213	m485	WINTON	Heaven knows. A lot.
L458204	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	How much money have you got?
L458203	u7213	m485	WINTON	You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
L458202	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Oh, is that what caused it?
L458201	u7213	m485	WINTON	No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
L458200	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
L458199	u7213	m485	WINTON	I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
L458198	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
L458194	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Darned if I don't! 
L458193	u7213	m485	WINTON	You go in for dangerous things.
L458192	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Why?
L458144	u7213	m485	WINTON	No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
L458143	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
L458082	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
L458081	u7213	m485	WINTON	Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
L458080	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
L458079	u7213	m485	WINTON	I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
L458078	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
L458077	u7213	m485	WINTON	Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
L458076	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
L458075	u7213	m485	WINTON	Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
L457755	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	That's what they're going to ask you.
L457754	u7213	m485	WINTON	Who'd steal her body?
L457753	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	That happens to be the truth.
L457752	u7213	m485	WINTON	Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
L457751	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
L457750	u7213	m485	WINTON	Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
L457749	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
L457748	u7213	m485	WINTON	No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
L457747	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	You weren't going with her?
L457746	u7213	m485	WINTON	We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
L457745	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	I see. Was that all she said?
L457744	u7213	m485	WINTON	She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
L457743	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
L457742	u7213	m485	WINTON	They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
L457741	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
L457740	u7213	m485	WINTON	For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
L457739	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
L457738	u7213	m485	WINTON	My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
L457737	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	That's what I said.
L457736	u7213	m485	WINTON	Cry-baby?
L457735	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
L457734	u7213	m485	WINTON	Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! 
L457733	u7206	m485	FLORENCE	Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
L457732	u7213	m485	WINTON	Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
L457545	u7208	m485	IGOR	Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
L457544	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	Good night, sir.
L457543	u7208	m485	IGOR	It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
L457542	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
L457541	u7208	m485	IGOR	You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
L457540	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
L457539	u7208	m485	IGOR	My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
L457538	u7207	m485	GOLATILY	Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
L457537	u7208	m485	IGOR	You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
L457574	u7214	m485	WORTH	Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done. 
L457573	u7208	m485	IGOR	You're insane.
L457572	u7214	m485	WORTH	Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
L457571	u7208	m485	IGOR	And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
L457570	u7214	m485	WORTH	You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
L457569	u7208	m485	IGOR	And you think I will permit this, my friend?
L457568	u7214	m485	WORTH	I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
L457565	u7208	m485	IGOR	You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
L457564	u7214	m485	WORTH	I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
L457563	u7208	m485	IGOR	A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
L457562	u7214	m485	WORTH	Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
L457561	u7208	m485	IGOR	Fire insurance!
L457560	u7214	m485	WORTH	No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
L457559	u7208	m485	IGOR	Is that a fact?
L457558	u7214	m485	WORTH	Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
L457557	u7208	m485	IGOR	Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
L457554	u7208	m485	IGOR	That is unfortunate.
L457553	u7214	m485	WORTH	I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
L458020	u7208	m485	IGOR	Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
L458019	u7210	m485	RALPH	I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
L457885	u7210	m485	RALPH	All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
L457884	u7208	m485	IGOR	If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
L457883	u7210	m485	RALPH	I will only be gone about half an hour.
L457882	u7208	m485	IGOR	That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
L457881	u7210	m485	RALPH	But I have some friends waiting.
L457880	u7208	m485	IGOR	To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
L457879	u7210	m485	RALPH	To lunch.
L457808	u7208	m485	IGOR	If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
L457807	u7210	m485	RALPH	But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
L457806	u7208	m485	IGOR	Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
L457805	u7210	m485	RALPH	That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
L457804	u7208	m485	IGOR	And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
L457803	u7210	m485	RALPH	One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
L457802	u7208	m485	IGOR	If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
L458018	u7208	m485	IGOR	Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
L458017	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I'd know him anywhere.
L457933	u7208	m485	IGOR	He can't hear you.
L457932	u7212	m485	SPARROW	What are you laughing at?
L457931	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
L457930	u7208	m485	IGOR	She is the soul of that statue.
L457828	u7208	m485	IGOR	You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
L457827	u7212	m485	SPARROW	I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
L457822	u7208	m485	IGOR	Yes.
L457821	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Shall we unpack it?
L457817	u7208	m485	IGOR	Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
L457816	u7212	m485	SPARROW	Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
L457815	u7208	m485	IGOR	Have you got it? Is it completed?
L457980	u7213	m485	WINTON	Thanks.
L457979	u7214	m485	WORTH	Well, any time I can do anything for you --
L457978	u7213	m485	WINTON	They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
L457977	u7214	m485	WORTH	I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
L457976	u7213	m485	WINTON	Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
L457975	u7214	m485	WORTH	Yep. Everything settled.
L470995	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	So what's your next move, Valiant?
L470994	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Well, I'll be...
L470993	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
L470981	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
L470980	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Oh, a ladies man, huh?
L470973	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah...
L470972	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You serve martinis, doncha?
L470971	u7288	m492	DOLORES	We don't serve formula. Snookums.
L470992	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
L470991	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
L470988	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
L470987	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it then?
L470986	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
L470983	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
L470982	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
L470978	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
L470977	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
L470976	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
L470975	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
L470974	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
L470863	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
L470862	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
L470861	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
L470860	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Shoulda guessed.
L470859	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
L470858	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
L470857	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
L470856	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
L470855	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
L470788	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
L470787	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
L470786	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
L470785	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
L470783	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
L470782	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A tweeting bird?
L470781	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	What's this, Roger?
L471319	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
L471318	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
L471317	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
L471316	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
L471315	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
L471314	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'll bet.
L471313	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
L471208	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, no...
L471207	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Sounds like singin'.
L471206	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's that comin' from the bar?
L471205	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
L471204	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
L471203	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
L471202	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon, right?
L471201	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
L471200	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
L471199	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
L471198	u7295	m492	VALIANT	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
L471197	u7288	m492	DOLORES	What was <u>that</u>?
L471083	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
L471082	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
L471079	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
L471078	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
L471073	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
L471072	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So what's the scam, Eddie?
L471066	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
L471065	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
L471057	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
L471056	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you decided to help him after all?
L471055	u7288	m492	DOLORES	It's all yours.
L471054	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
L471053	u7288	m492	DOLORES	He's a riot.
L471048	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
L471047	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
L470998	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's a Toon... who cares?
L470997	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
L470990	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
L470989	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
L470985	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L470984	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
L470969	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
L470968	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Do you think the rabbit did it?
L470962	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Bastards put him on notice.
L470961	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
L470960	u7288	m492	DOLORES	A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
L470957	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
L470956	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
L470835	u7288	m492	DOLORES	R.K. Maroon.
L470834	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Check the scrawl.
L470833	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Is this paper even good?
L470832	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
L470831	u7288	m492	DOLORES	This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
L470830	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
L470829	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
L471487	u7289	m492	DOOM	That's right, me.
L471486	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You?
L471483	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
L471482	u7289	m492	DOOM	Surprised?
L471481	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
L471447	u7289	m492	DOOM	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
L471446	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
L471445	u7289	m492	DOOM	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
L471444	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell's a freeway?
L471443	u7289	m492	DOOM	Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
L471441	u7289	m492	DOOM	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
L471440	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
L471427	u7289	m492	DOOM	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
L471426	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
L471425	u7289	m492	DOOM	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
L471424	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So you're Cloverleaf?
L471423	u7289	m492	DOOM	No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
L471411	u7289	m492	DOOM	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
L471410	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
L471409	u7289	m492	DOOM	These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
L471258	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
L471257	u7289	m492	DOOM	Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
L471253	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
L471252	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
L471145	u7289	m492	DOOM	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
L471144	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
L471143	u7289	m492	DOOM	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
L471142	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
L471141	u7289	m492	DOOM	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
L471140	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
L471139	u7289	m492	DOOM	Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
L471138	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
L471137	u7289	m492	DOOM	They?
L471136	u7295	m492	VALIANT	They must've taken it off me.
L471132	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
L471131	u7289	m492	DOOM	Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
L471128	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Ask her...
L471127	u7289	m492	DOOM	Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
L470933	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
L470932	u7289	m492	DOOM	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
L470931	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
L470930	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
L470929	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
L470925	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
L470924	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
L470923	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
L471160	u7290	m492	EARL	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
L471159	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
L471158	u7290	m492	EARL	Does it hurt?
L471157	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No...
L471156	u7290	m492	EARL	You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
L471155	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What am I, Earl?
L471154	u7290	m492	EARL	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
L471153	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Toon cops worked me over.
L471152	u7290	m492	EARL	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
L471151	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
L471150	u7290	m492	EARL	Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
L471406	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Eddie, come on.
L471405	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hold on a second.
L471397	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	He made me laugh.
L471396	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
L471395	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
L471394	u7295	m492	VALIANT	A joker to the end.
L471393	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
L471392	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it?
L471391	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
L471390	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How did you get onto Doom?
L471387	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's right here in the...
L471386	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Where is he?
L471385	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
L471384	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I didn't know who I could trust.
L471383	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why didn't you tell me?
L471382	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
L471379	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
L471378	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
L471377	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
L471376	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You shot Roger.
L471187	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
L471186	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
L471185	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
L471184	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So altruistic.
L471182	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
L471181	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
L471180	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
L471179	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
L471178	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
L471177	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	No, no, no... I love my husband.
L471176	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
L471175	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
L471174	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
L471173	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Toons aren't given imperfections.
L471172	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
L471170	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
L471169	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
L471168	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's because I don't have a doorbell.
L471167	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
L471130	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
L471129	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
L471493	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
L471492	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Doom.
L471491	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	What the hell is that?
L470951	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
L470950	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's with the dip?
L470940	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
L470939	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
L470910	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Wait here...
L470909	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What a gasser.
L470908	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
L470906	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
L470905	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Now what?
L470903	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what you woke me up for?
L470902	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
L471349	u7293	m492	MAROON	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
L471348	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Take it easy.
L471347	u7293	m492	MAROON	You tricked me, damn you!
L471346	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, I don't.
L471345	u7293	m492	MAROON	You got the will in there, don't ya?
L471343	u7293	m492	MAROON	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
L471342	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
L471341	u7293	m492	MAROON	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
L471340	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
L471339	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That was the idea.
L471338	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant!  You surprised me.
L471324	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stop what?
L471323	u7293	m492	MAROON	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
L471322	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe.  Why?
L471321	u7293	m492	MAROON	Have you got the will?
L471320	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
L471099	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
L471098	u7293	m492	MAROON	I've already seen your photographs.
L471097	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
L471096	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
L471095	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
L470894	u7293	m492	MAROON	Sure, Valiant, sure...
L470893	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
L470888	u7293	m492	MAROON	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
L470887	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
L470820	u7295	m492	VALIANT	As soon as is humanly possible.
L470819	u7293	m492	MAROON	When will I hear from you?
L470818	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aren't you the lucky one...
L470817	u7293	m492	MAROON	I got him on loan from Disney.
L470813	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So's the job.
L470812	u7293	m492	MAROON	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
L470811	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
L470810	u7293	m492	MAROON	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
L470809	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't work in Toontown.
L470808	u7293	m492	MAROON	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
L470807	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So what do you want me to do?
L470806	u7293	m492	MAROON	"Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up."
L470805	u7293	m492	MAROON	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
L470804	u7295	m492	VALIANT	One too many safes dropped on his head?
L470803	u7293	m492	MAROON	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
L470802	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
L470801	u7293	m492	MAROON	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
L470795	u7293	m492	MAROON	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
L470794	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
L470793	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
L471518	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	From this box here...
L471517	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
L471516	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only time will tell.
L471515	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
L471514	u7295	m492	VALIANT	By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
L471512	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
L471511	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, kid, you're a real hero.
L471508	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
L471507	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Keep reading...
L471505	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Good idea.
L471504	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you oughta read it to her.
L471503	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471502	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
L471498	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah...
L471497	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
L471496	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
L471456	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
L471455	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
L471369	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
L471368	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin' in there?
L471335	u7295	m492	VALIANT	... I'd head for Cucamonga.
L471334	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471333	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I don't make it back here by ten...
L471332	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I rest my case.
L471331	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Two bits.
L471330	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
L471329	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
L471328	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Forget it.
L471327	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
L471326	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
L471325	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
L471311	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, it's not.
L471310	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Wrong number?
L471309	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Get away from there.
L471308	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I'll get it.
L471307	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
L471306	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Safe?
L471305	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
L471304	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
L471303	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
L471302	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A Toon?  Noooo.
L471301	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
L471300	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
L471299	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
L471296	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What is this, Twenty Questions?
L471295	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
L471294	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Me.
L471293	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Say, who's this guy laughin'?
L471291	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We can't do anything till it's dark.
L471290	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
L471289	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My brother.  Get inside.
L471288	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
L471264	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
L471263	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
L471261	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
L471260	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
L471259	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
L471256	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
L471255	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
L471254	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
L471225	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
L471224	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
L471223	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
L471222	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
L471221	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
L471220	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
L471219	u7295	m492	VALIANT	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
L471218	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
L471217	u7295	m492	VALIANT	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
L471216	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
L471215	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
L471214	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, don't I get an encore?
L471081	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
L471080	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
L471077	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
L471076	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	How do you know that?
L471075	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
L471074	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	The habeus corpus is thickening.
L471071	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
L471070	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
L471069	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
L471064	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
L471063	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
L471062	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
L471061	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
L471060	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
L471059	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, that's better.
L471058	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Does this help?
L471039	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't ever forget that.
L471038	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
L471037	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
L471034	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
L471033	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
L471019	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
L471018	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
L471017	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
L471016	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
L471008	u7295	m492	VALIANT	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
L471007	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
L471006	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
L471005	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
L471004	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
L471003	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
L471002	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin'?
L471001	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Aah!
L471000	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aah!
L470897	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Divorce?  Never!
L470896	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
L470882	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
L470881	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Pattycake!  Pattycake!
L482520	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	I was talking to my wife.
L482519	u7405	m501	BO	No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
L482518	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	You mind?
L482517	u7405	m501	BO	Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
L482516	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
L482515	u7405	m501	BO	Good. I fucking hate Australians.
L482514	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	No.
L482513	u7405	m501	BO	Are you Australian?
L482512	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	That's it?
L482511	u7405	m501	BO	What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
L481933	u7406	m501	BOBBY	Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
L481932	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
L481926	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Come on.  Ease off the girl.
L481925	u7406	m501	BOBBY	What?
L481922	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
L481921	u7406	m501	BOBBY	What can I do for you?
L481920	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Yeah.
L481919	u7406	m501	BOBBY	Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
L481916	u7406	m501	BOBBY	The spiders.
L481915	u7413	m501	JIMMY	What?
L481914	u7406	m501	BOBBY	Shhh.
L481913	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Bobby?
L482610	u7410	m501	DANNY	Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
L482609	u7407	m501	BOOKMAN	What is it?
L482607	u7410	m501	DANNY	No, Why?
L482606	u7407	m501	BOOKMAN	Did you see his hair color?
L482605	u7410	m501	DANNY	They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
L482604	u7407	m501	BOOKMAN	How about in the house?
L482603	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
L482601	u7407	m501	BOOKMAN	Not even a guess?
L482600	u7410	m501	DANNY	All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
L482585	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'll see you tonight.
L482584	u7408	m501	BUBBA	I ain't a idiot, asshole.
L482583	u7410	m501	DANNY	Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
L482582	u7408	m501	BUBBA	Yeah.
L482581	u7410	m501	DANNY	Everything go?
L482580	u7408	m501	BUBBA	Yeah.
L482241	u7408	m501	BUBBA	Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
L482240	u7410	m501	DANNY	I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
L482239	u7408	m501	BUBBA	I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
L482238	u7410	m501	DANNY	Now that's down-right insulting.
L482237	u7408	m501	BUBBA	Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
L482236	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
L482235	u7408	m501	BUBBA	I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
L482040	u7410	m501	DANNY	It's downright classy is what it is.
L482039	u7408	m501	BUBBA	First rate, ain't it?
L482038	u7410	m501	DANNY	Who wouldn't?
L482037	u7408	m501	BUBBA	You like that?
L482036	u7410	m501	DANNY	Ride 'em cowboy)
L482701	u7410	m501	DANNY	Your daughter needs you.  Go.
L482700	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I don't want to leave you.
L482699	u7410	m501	DANNY	Colette, go.
L482689	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Danny, it's not what you think.
L482688	u7410	m501	DANNY	You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
L482541	u7410	m501	DANNY	Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
L482540	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Why?
L482539	u7410	m501	DANNY	Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
L482537	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I don't want to.
L482536	u7410	m501	DANNY	Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
L482535	u7409	m501	COLETTE	What is it?
L482534	u7410	m501	DANNY	I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
L482533	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Really, I don't want to.
L482530	u7410	m501	DANNY	Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
L482529	u7409	m501	COLETTE	They would have killed you too.
L482528	u7410	m501	DANNY	No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
L482507	u7410	m501	DANNY	I can't tell you.
L482506	u7409	m501	COLETTE	No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
L482505	u7410	m501	DANNY	Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
L482504	u7409	m501	COLETTE	What's wrong, Danny?
L482503	u7410	m501	DANNY	I just can't. Okay?
L482502	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Why not?
L482498	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I been that way ever since.
L482497	u7410	m501	DANNY	Ass first into the world.
L482496	u7409	m501	COLETTE	From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
L482495	u7410	m501	DANNY	You always been this stubborn?
L482494	u7409	m501	COLETTE	It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
L482493	u7410	m501	DANNY	Find a new job.
L482492	u7409	m501	COLETTE	He knows where I work.
L482491	u7410	m501	DANNY	You can still work.
L482490	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I need my paycheck.
L482489	u7410	m501	DANNY	What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
L482488	u7409	m501	COLETTE	We been through that.
L482486	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Please open the door, Danny.
L482485	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm kind of busy.
L482484	u7409	m501	COLETTE	It's me.
L482483	u7410	m501	DANNY	Who is it?
L482359	u7410	m501	DANNY	No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
L482358	u7409	m501	COLETTE	You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
L482357	u7410	m501	DANNY	Therapy session is over.
L482356	u7409	m501	COLETTE	What are you hiding, Danny?
L482355	u7410	m501	DANNY	You don't like the tune, find another station.
L482354	u7409	m501	COLETTE	There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
L482353	u7410	m501	DANNY	Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
L482352	u7409	m501	COLETTE	You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
L482351	u7410	m501	DANNY	How much time do you have?
L482350	u7409	m501	COLETTE	What is wrong with you?
L482349	u7410	m501	DANNY	How much time do you have?
L482348	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
L482347	u7410	m501	DANNY	So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
L482346	u7409	m501	COLETTE	This has nothing to do with him.
L482345	u7410	m501	DANNY	Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
L482344	u7409	m501	COLETTE	You really need to lighten up.
L482343	u7410	m501	DANNY	It gets me through the day.
L482342	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
L482341	u7410	m501	DANNY	What do you want from me, Colette?
L482340	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Nothing.
L482339	u7410	m501	DANNY	: What are you up to?
L482336	u7410	m501	DANNY	I try.
L482335	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Is that how you play?
L482334	u7410	m501	DANNY	It's the only way to play.
L482333	u7409	m501	COLETTE	And you admire that?
L482332	u7410	m501	DANNY	Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
L482331	u7410	m501	DANNY	Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
L482330	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Like you?
L482329	u7410	m501	DANNY	Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
L482328	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Never heard of him.
L482327	u7410	m501	DANNY	"Miles Davis. ""All Blues."""
L482326	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Trust me. We're safe.
L482325	u7410	m501	DANNY	How far out of town?
L482324	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Don't worry. He's out of town.
L482323	u7410	m501	DANNY	Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
L482322	u7409	m501	COLETTE	What happened to your eye?
L482321	u7410	m501	DANNY	Oh. Hi.
L482233	u7409	m501	COLETTE	How?
L482232	u7410	m501	DANNY	Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
L482231	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
L482230	u7410	m501	DANNY	That's long enough to get out of town.
L482229	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
L482228	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why don't you call the cops?
L482227	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Because he'll kill me.
L482226	u7410	m501	DANNY	Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
L482225	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Fuck you.
L482224	u7410	m501	DANNY	You get off on abuse or something?
L482223	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I can't leave.
L482222	u7410	m501	DANNY	There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
L482221	u7409	m501	COLETTE	You don't understand.
L482220	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why not?
L482219	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I can't.
L482218	u7410	m501	DANNY	Then leave.
L482217	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
L482216	u7410	m501	DANNY	Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
L482215	u7409	m501	COLETTE	It's not that easy.
L482214	u7410	m501	DANNY	Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
L482213	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Go ahead.
L482212	u7410	m501	DANNY	Nothing.
L482211	u7409	m501	COLETTE	What?
L482210	u7410	m501	DANNY	Colette ...
L482209	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Oh, he's a keeper all right.
L482208	u7410	m501	DANNY	This man sounds like a real catch.
L482207	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
L482206	u7410	m501	DANNY	Ouch.
L482205	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
L482203	u7409	m501	COLETTE	That bad, huh?
L482202	u7410	m501	DANNY	Leave me out of this.
L482201	u7409	m501	COLETTE	What about the guy on the very bottom?
L482200	u7410	m501	DANNY	I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
L482199	u7409	m501	COLETTE	How?
L482198	u7410	m501	DANNY	Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
L482197	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Oh God.
L482196	u7410	m501	DANNY	I was thinking Alice Cooper.
L482195	u7409	m501	COLETTE	Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
L482192	u7409	m501	COLETTE	I understand. Thanks anyway.
L482191	u7410	m501	DANNY	Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
L482631	u7410	m501	DANNY	Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
L482630	u7419	m501	TRAHN	What?
L482629	u7410	m501	DANNY	Oh shit
L482628	u7419	m501	TRAHN	Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
L482627	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
L482626	u7419	m501	TRAHN	How you holding up?
L482620	u7410	m501	DANNY	These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
L482619	u7419	m501	TRAHN	That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
L482618	u7410	m501	DANNY	I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
L482476	u7410	m501	DANNY	How?
L482475	u7416	m501	NANCY	It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
L482474	u7410	m501	DANNY	I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
L482473	u7416	m501	NANCY	Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
L482472	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
L482467	u7416	m501	NANCY	I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
L482466	u7410	m501	DANNY	Maybe I am dealing with it.
L482465	u7416	m501	NANCY	You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
L482464	u7410	m501	DANNY	Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
L482463	u7416	m501	NANCY	I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
L482462	u7410	m501	DANNY	Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
L482456	u7416	m501	NANCY	Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
L482455	u7410	m501	DANNY	All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
L482454	u7410	m501	DANNY	It's Tom.
L482453	u7416	m501	NANCY	Who is it?
L482579	u7410	m501	DANNY	You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
L482578	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
L482576	u7410	m501	DANNY	Good for you Jimmy.
L482575	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
L482573	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm sorry. I couldn't.
L482572	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
L482570	u7410	m501	DANNY	Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
L482569	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
L482568	u7413	m501	JIMMY	And you want me to do you some big favor?
L482567	u7410	m501	DANNY	I don't trust anybody.
L482566	u7413	m501	JIMMY	You don't trust me?
L482565	u7410	m501	DANNY	I can't tell you.
L482564	u7413	m501	JIMMY	But... why? Why would you pretend?
L482563	u7410	m501	DANNY	Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
L482562	u7413	m501	JIMMY	No one ever noticed?
L482561	u7410	m501	DANNY	You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
L482560	u7413	m501	JIMMY	This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
L482559	u7410	m501	DANNY	When? When did you ever see me use?
L482558	u7413	m501	JIMMY	But...I've seen you.
L482557	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
L482556	u7413	m501	JIMMY	What?
L482555	u7413	m501	JIMMY	It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
L482554	u7410	m501	DANNY	What the hell is that?
L482553	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Hey, check it out...
L482552	u7410	m501	DANNY	Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
L482551	u7413	m501	JIMMY	You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
L482550	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why?
L482549	u7413	m501	JIMMY	It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
L482548	u7410	m501	DANNY	Wait till I tell you what it is.
L482547	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Okay
L482546	u7410	m501	DANNY	You aren't coming with me.
L482545	u7413	m501	JIMMY	But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
L482544	u7410	m501	DANNY	Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
L482543	u7413	m501	JIMMY	What's this?
L482161	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Thanks for not laughing at me.
L482160	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yes, Jimmy.
L482159	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Danny?
L482158	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yes, Jimmy
L482157	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Was he the president?
L482156	u7410	m501	DANNY	John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
L482155	u7413	m501	JIMMY	What does J.F.K. stand for?
L482154	u7410	m501	DANNY	Sure, Jimmy.
L482153	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Can I ask you something?
L482152	u7410	m501	DANNY	No. I'm good.
L482151	u7413	m501	JIMMY	You want a hit?
L482096	u7413	m501	JIMMY	No  You think she's a tweaker?
L482095	u7410	m501	DANNY	You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
L482093	u7410	m501	DANNY	You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
L482092	u7413	m501	JIMMY	He doesn't have one.
L482091	u7410	m501	DANNY	You're going to have to explain that one.
L482090	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I think on account of his nose.
L482089	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
L482088	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Palmdale
L482087	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
L482086	u7413	m501	JIMMY	You mean, like to throw 'em off?
L482085	u7410	m501	DANNY	You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
L482081	u7410	m501	DANNY	Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
L482080	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
L482079	u7410	m501	DANNY	Not tonight.
L482078	u7413	m501	JIMMY	You wanna score some go-fast?
L482077	u7413	m501	JIMMY	The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
L482076	u7410	m501	DANNY	Jimmy, where do you find these people?
L482073	u7413	m501	JIMMY	10%.  That's ...
L482072	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
L482071	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Sure.
L482070	u7410	m501	DANNY	Can you set that up?
L482069	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
L482068	u7410	m501	DANNY	Can your man handle that?
L482067	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Fuuuuuck
L482066	u7410	m501	DANNY	A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
L482065	u7413	m501	JIMMY	A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
L482064	u7410	m501	DANNY	I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
L482063	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
L482062	u7410	m501	DANNY	You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
L482061	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I find myself in dire need of some cash.
L482060	u7410	m501	DANNY	Don't get carried away.
L482059	u7413	m501	JIMMY	You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
L482058	u7410	m501	DANNY	What?
L482057	u7413	m501	JIMMY	See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
L482056	u7410	m501	DANNY	Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
L482055	u7413	m501	JIMMY	So, why'd you want to see me?
L482052	u7410	m501	DANNY	I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
L482051	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
L482050	u7410	m501	DANNY	That's a good one.
L482048	u7410	m501	DANNY	You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
L482047	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Why does it have to feel so bad?
L482046	u7410	m501	DANNY	Sorry.
L482045	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
L482044	u7410	m501	DANNY	You on a roll?
L482043	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I'm hurting.
L481939	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
L481938	u7410	m501	DANNY	Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
L481912	u7410	m501	DANNY	Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
L481911	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Finland is a country.
L481910	u7410	m501	DANNY	You don't say.
L481909	u7413	m501	JIMMY	My features. They're Finnish.
L481908	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why's that?
L481907	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
L481906	u7410	m501	DANNY	I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
L481905	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Nice day
L481904	u7410	m501	DANNY	Lead the way.
L481903	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I know a guy.
L481902	u7410	m501	DANNY	Where to?
L481901	u7410	m501	DANNY	Midnight?
L481900	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Twelve
L481899	u7410	m501	DANNY	What time is it?
L481898	u7413	m501	JIMMY	Guess it's our turn.
L481897	u7410	m501	DANNY	How the hell did we get this detail?
L482481	u7420	m501	VERNE	Understand what?
L482480	u7410	m501	DANNY	You don't understand.
L482479	u7420	m501	VERNE	You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
L482478	u7410	m501	DANNY	What does that mean?
L482477	u7420	m501	VERNE	By not disgracing her memory!
L482470	u7410	m501	DANNY	You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
L482469	u7420	m501	VERNE	That was my idea.
L482468	u7410	m501	DANNY	Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
L482656	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah, dickhead.
L482655	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Cool it. We got business.
L482653	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
L482652	u7410	m501	DANNY	This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
L482651	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Just some buddies.
L482650	u7410	m501	DANNY	What the hell is this?
L482439	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	I'll keep that in mind.
L482438	u7410	m501	DANNY	Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
L482437	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
L482436	u7410	m501	DANNY	What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
L482435	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
L482434	u7410	m501	DANNY	I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
L482433	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Yeah.
L482432	u7410	m501	DANNY	CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
L482419	u7410	m501	DANNY	I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
L482418	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Now get talkin'
L482417	u7410	m501	DANNY	Okay! Okay!
L482416	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Shoot him.
L482407	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Uh-uh-uh ...
L482406	u7410	m501	DANNY	Please .. I don't know what you're ...
L482405	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
L482404	u7410	m501	DANNY	What?!
L482403	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
L482402	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Big Bill
L482401	u7410	m501	DANNY	Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
L482398	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Big Bill.
L482397	u7410	m501	DANNY	Come on, guys ...
L482396	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Pull your motherfucking pants down.
L482395	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm sorry?
L482394	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Pull your pants down.
L482393	u7410	m501	DANNY	You want to do this some other time?
L482138	u7410	m501	DANNY	Hey, I don't play that.
L482137	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
L482136	u7410	m501	DANNY	Hey, I was just trying to ...
L482135	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
L482134	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why do you say that?
L482133	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
L482132	u7410	m501	DANNY	Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
L482131	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	If you say so.
L482130	u7410	m501	DANNY	So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
L482129	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
L482128	u7410	m501	DANNY	But I just met you.
L482127	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Anything for a dear friend.
L482126	u7410	m501	DANNY	You're serious?
L482125	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Hey, okay.
L482124	u7410	m501	DANNY	Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
L482123	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
L482122	u7410	m501	DANNY	I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
L482121	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Make me an offer.
L482120	u7410	m501	DANNY	Can we talk price?
L482119	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Secret recipe.
L482118	u7410	m501	DANNY	Not bad.
L482117	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
L482116	u7410	m501	DANNY	No, I'm good.
L482115	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
L482114	u7410	m501	DANNY	The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
L482113	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	Crank or glass?
L482112	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
L482109	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
L482108	u7410	m501	DANNY	Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
L482107	u7417	m501	POOH-BEAR	I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
L482668	u7410	m501	DANNY	Answer the fucking question!
L482667	u7418	m501	TANNER	Please ... don't do this ...
L482666	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
L482665	u7418	m501	TANNER	Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
L482664	u7410	m501	DANNY	My name is Tom.
L482663	u7418	m501	TANNER	Danny?
L482451	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah.
L482450	u7418	m501	TANNER	I thought you'd be happy.
L482449	u7410	m501	DANNY	Jesus.
L482448	u7418	m501	TANNER	Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
L482445	u7418	m501	TANNER	Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
L482444	u7410	m501	DANNY	Murder.  Beautiful.
L482443	u7418	m501	TANNER	We got the 411 on your good old boy.
L482442	u7410	m501	DANNY	That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
L482379	u7410	m501	DANNY	Who is it?
L482378	u7418	m501	TANNER	I'm afraid so, Danny.
L482377	u7410	m501	DANNY	What? Is it bad?
L482368	u7418	m501	TANNER	That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
L482367	u7410	m501	DANNY	What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
L482366	u7418	m501	TANNER	Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
L482365	u7410	m501	DANNY	Whata you mean?  He told me -
L482364	u7418	m501	TANNER	That's because he doesn't have one.
L482295	u7418	m501	TANNER	You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
L482294	u7410	m501	DANNY	News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
L482293	u7418	m501	TANNER	Bullshit. He's a liar.
L482282	u7418	m501	TANNER	No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
L482281	u7410	m501	DANNY	For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
L482280	u7418	m501	TANNER	Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
L482279	u7410	m501	DANNY	Whata you mean I've got no choice?
L482278	u7418	m501	TANNER	You've got no choice.
L482275	u7410	m501	DANNY	Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
L482274	u7418	m501	TANNER	Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
L482273	u7410	m501	DANNY	Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
L482272	u7418	m501	TANNER	What're your taking down?
L482267	u7410	m501	DANNY	After that ass-whipping you gave me?
L482266	u7418	m501	TANNER	You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
L482265	u7410	m501	DANNY	Bubba.
L482264	u7418	m501	TANNER	This chink have a name?
L482263	u7410	m501	DANNY	I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
L482254	u7410	m501	DANNY	I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
L482253	u7418	m501	TANNER	You think this is funny motherfucker?
L482251	u7418	m501	TANNER	Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
L482250	u7410	m501	DANNY	Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
L482249	u7418	m501	TANNER	Cut the shit, Flynne.
L482248	u7410	m501	DANNY	I was trying to score some dope.
L482247	u7418	m501	TANNER	Question is, what are you doing here?
L482246	u7410	m501	DANNY	What the hell are you doing here?
L482035	u7418	m501	TANNER	Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
L482034	u7410	m501	DANNY	When?
L482033	u7418	m501	TANNER	Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
L482028	u7418	m501	TANNER	Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
L482027	u7410	m501	DANNY	If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
L482014	u7410	m501	DANNY	Tell me what?
L482013	u7418	m501	TANNER	I was getting to it.
L482011	u7418	m501	TANNER	Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
L482010	u7410	m501	DANNY	Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
L482009	u7418	m501	TANNER	Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
L482008	u7410	m501	DANNY	You don't find that repugnant?
L482007	u7418	m501	TANNER	The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
L482006	u7410	m501	DANNY	Don't you wonder why I do it?
L482005	u7418	m501	TANNER	It's not my place.
L482004	u7410	m501	DANNY	Thanks for not judging me.
L482003	u7418	m501	TANNER	Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
L482002	u7410	m501	DANNY	Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
L482001	u7418	m501	TANNER	Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
L482000	u7410	m501	DANNY	You think I'm a Judas?
L481966	u7410	m501	DANNY	Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
L481965	u7418	m501	TANNER	Danny, I'm touched.
L481964	u7410	m501	DANNY	Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
L481963	u7418	m501	TANNER	God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
L481962	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
L481951	u7410	m501	DANNY	It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
L481950	u7418	m501	TANNER	No last name?
L481949	u7410	m501	DANNY	Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
L481948	u7418	m501	TANNER	What?
L481947	u7410	m501	DANNY	Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
L481946	u7418	m501	TANNER	You got a name?
L481945	u7410	m501	DANNY	Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
L481944	u7418	m501	TANNER	Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
L481943	u7410	m501	DANNY	If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
L481942	u7418	m501	TANNER	You go, boy.
L481941	u7410	m501	DANNY	I've got a hot one.
L482588	u7410	m501	DANNY	With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
L482587	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Nervous?
L482447	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
L482446	u7410	m501	DANNY	You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
L482388	u7410	m501	DANNY	I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
L482387	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	When is the deal going down?
L482382	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
L482381	u7410	m501	DANNY	Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
L482376	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	You mean the menacing red car?
L482375	u7410	m501	DANNY	Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
L482372	u7410	m501	DANNY	What if he caps me before you can make a move?
L482371	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
L482370	u7410	m501	DANNY	Funny, I don't feel lucky.
L482369	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	You're lucky, Flynne.
L482363	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	They have. But they never found a lab.
L482362	u7410	m501	DANNY	Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
L482361	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Several possession charges, but nothing major.
L482360	u7410	m501	DANNY	Excuse me?
L482292	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
L482291	u7410	m501	DANNY	Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
L482290	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	"Who'd have thought it?  Danny ""Chickenshit"" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses."
L482289	u7410	m501	DANNY	Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
L482288	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	What'd you do, piss your pants?
L482287	u7410	m501	DANNY	That would be me.
L482286	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	What's that smell?
L482271	u7410	m501	DANNY	Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
L482270	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
L482269	u7410	m501	DANNY	Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
L482268	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	What's on the other end of this thing?
L482262	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
L482261	u7410	m501	DANNY	He's the only one I told.
L482260	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Who the hell is Jimmy?
L482259	u7410	m501	DANNY	Jimmy?
L482257	u7410	m501	DANNY	I still don't know what you're talking about.
L482256	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	We know what's going on.
L482032	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
L482031	u7410	m501	DANNY	Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
L482025	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
L482024	u7410	m501	DANNY	What?!
L482023	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	He knows somebody ratted him.
L482022	u7410	m501	DANNY	And what does this have to do with me?
L482021	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	The Mexicali Boys
L482020	u7410	m501	DANNY	To who?
L482019	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Turns out he's connected.
L482018	u7410	m501	DANNY	Yeah.  What about him?
L482017	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
L481970	u7410	m501	DANNY	Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
L481969	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
L481968	u7410	m501	DANNY	Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
L481967	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
L481957	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	What's he holding?
L481956	u7410	m501	DANNY	Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
L481955	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
L481954	u7410	m501	DANNY	That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
L481953	u7410	m501	DANNY	It speaks!
L481952	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	This the guy?
L482316	u7415	m501	LIZ	Why are you doing this?
L482315	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	My sentiments exactly.
L482314	u7415	m501	LIZ	That is so unfair.
L482313	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
L482312	u7415	m501	LIZ	Here it comes, poor Tom.
L482311	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
L482310	u7415	m501	LIZ	Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
L482309	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
L482308	u7415	m501	LIZ	Just admit you're wrong.
L482307	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	Just no pleasing you, is there?
L482306	u7415	m501	LIZ	I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
L482305	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
L482304	u7415	m501	LIZ	Look at that place. It's creepy.
L482303	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	What do you mean?
L482302	u7415	m501	LIZ	You think that's a good idea?
L482301	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
L482300	u7415	m501	LIZ	Tom, quit fucking around.
L482299	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
L482298	u7415	m501	LIZ	You mean like the Donner Party?
L482297	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
L482296	u7415	m501	LIZ	Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
L481996	u7415	m501	LIZ	No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
L481995	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	There's no motels around here.
L481994	u7415	m501	LIZ	Tom, let's spend the night here.
L481991	u7415	m501	LIZ	It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
L481990	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	Really?
L481989	u7415	m501	LIZ	And you've got wiener breath.
L481988	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	You, madam, are a heartless wench.
L481987	u7415	m501	LIZ	I was talking about Miles.
L481986	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	Again, I thank you.
L481985	u7415	m501	LIZ	And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
L481984	u7411	m501	DANNY/TOM	Thank you.  Thank you very much.
L481983	u7415	m501	LIZ	A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
L482648	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Maybe he isn't showing.
L482647	u7418	m501	TANNER	Where's Bubba?
L482590	u7418	m501	TANNER	Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
L482589	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
L482441	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
L482440	u7418	m501	TANNER	We're in business.
L482385	u7418	m501	TANNER	Now that's scary!
L482384	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
L482374	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	Don't we always take good care of you?
L482373	u7418	m501	TANNER	Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
L482285	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
L482284	u7418	m501	TANNER	And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
L482243	u7418	m501	TANNER	Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
L482242	u7412	m501	GARCETTI	You thinking what I'm thinking?
L482185	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I thought you were done.
L482184	u7414	m501	KUJO	Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
L482180	u7414	m501	KUJO	No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
L482179	u7413	m501	JIMMY	I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
L482178	u7414	m501	KUJO	Don't worry about it.
L482177	u7413	m501	JIMMY	What is that? Rum and coke?
L482165	u7414	m501	KUJO	Better than drugs.
L482164	u7413	m501	JIMMY	What is it, drugs?
L482163	u7414	m501	KUJO	Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
L488214	u7469	m505	DEWEY	That doesn't work, sir.
L488213	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
L488197	u7469	m505	DEWEY	What now?
L488196	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
L488195	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Can't we hold him?
L488024	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
L488023	u7469	m505	DEWEY	How's the name search going?
L488021	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
L488020	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I can do it, Captain.
L487919	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We're aware of that.
L487918	u7469	m505	DEWEY	The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
L487917	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We know that, son.
L488170	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	On national television.
L488169	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	I would say we are now officially baffled.
L488168	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
L488167	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	You're sure about this two person thing?
L488166	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	They've broken their pattern.
L488165	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	He's broken his pattern.
L487936	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
L487935	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
L487914	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
L487913	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
L487887	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Take the neighborhood.
L487886	u7483	m505	SHERIFF	Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
L487885	u7463	m505	CAPTAIN TYLER	Have you checked the...
L487830	u7464	m505	CICI	Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
L487829	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
L487828	u7464	m505	CICI	I'm losing you.
L487827	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Hang up...call...
L487826	u7464	m505	CICI	What? I can't hear you...
L487825	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Don't do that. Hang up...call...
L487823	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	That's smart.
L487822	u7464	m505	CICI	Outside.
L487817	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	I can't believe you're alone in that house.
L487816	u7464	m505	CICI	Stop it...
L487815	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
L487813	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Where?
L487812	u7464	m505	CICI	I heard a noise.
L487811	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	What is it?
L487810	u7464	m505	CICI	Shit.
L487809	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
L487808	u7464	m505	CICI	No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
L487787	u7464	m505	CICI	Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
L487786	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	Don't. Think Bailey.
L487785	u7464	m505	CICI	I won't.
L487784	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
L487777	u7464	m505	CICI	No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
L487776	u7471	m505	GIRL ON PHONE	thought he was doing AA.
L487775	u7464	m505	CICI	No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
L487862	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Don't forget to set the alarm.
L487861	u7464	m505	CICI	WHAAAATT?
L487860	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	No, it's me.
L487859	u7464	m505	CICI	Hello? Ted?
L487803	u7464	m505	CICI	I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
L487802	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	I'm inquisitive.
L487801	u7464	m505	CICI	Why do you always answer a question with a question?
L487800	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Why would you wanna do that?
L487799	u7464	m505	CICI	What if I said goodbye?
L487798	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	What if I said you?
L487797	u7464	m505	CICI	Drink with your brain. That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
L487796	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	That's too bad.
L487795	u7464	m505	CICI	I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
L487794	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Why aren't you there?
L487793	u7464	m505	CICI	We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
L487792	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Where is everybody?
L487791	u7464	m505	CICI	Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
L487790	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	That's okay.
L487789	u7464	m505	CICI	Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
L487783	u7464	m505	CICI	Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
L487782	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Someone who wants to talk to you.
L487781	u7464	m505	CICI	Cici. Who's this?
L487780	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Who is this?
L487779	u7464	m505	CICI	Yes.
L487854	u7464	m505	CICI	I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
L487853	u7466	m505	DAWNIE	Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
L487847	u7464	m505	CICI	Just some asshole trying to scare me.
L487846	u7466	m505	DAWNIE	I had to change. Did anyone call?
L487845	u7464	m505	CICI	I thought you were going to the mixer?
L487844	u7466	m505	DAWNIE	I live here.
L487843	u7464	m505	CICI	Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
L488489	u7465	m505	COTTON	Not until you?re dead.
L488488	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It?s over, Cotton.
L488487	u7465	m505	COTTON	I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
L488486	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Please, Cotton, don?t do this.
L488485	u7465	m505	COTTON	It?s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I?m the victim.
L488108	u7465	m505	COTTON	You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
L488107	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What?
L488106	u7465	m505	COTTON	It helped me realize one thing.
L488105	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Did it?
L488104	u7465	m505	COTTON	I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
L488103	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
L488102	u7465	m505	COTTON	I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
L488101	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
L488100	u7465	m505	COTTON	You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
L488099	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I did that.
L488098	u7465	m505	COTTON	You could start with an apology.
L488097	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What do you want from me, Cotton?
L488096	u7465	m505	COTTON	Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
L488095	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I don't think that's a good idea.
L488094	u7465	m505	COTTON	Can we talk?
L488093	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Cotton.
L488208	u7465	m505	COTTON	Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
L488207	u7470	m505	GALE	Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
L488206	u7465	m505	COTTON	You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
L488205	u7470	m505	GALE	Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
L488204	u7465	m505	COTTON	No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
L488203	u7470	m505	GALE	You have a right to be angry.
L488202	u7465	m505	COTTON	Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
L488201	u7470	m505	GALE	Did you do it?
L488200	u7465	m505	COTTON	You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
L488476	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Enter Cotton Weary.
L488475	u7470	m505	GALE	But you?ll never get away with it.
L488474	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Finish what my son started.
L488473	u7470	m505	GALE	What are you going to do?
L488466	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
L488465	u7470	m505	GALE	Jesus, you?re just as whacked as your son.
L488460	u7470	m505	GALE	You?re all in this together?
L488459	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	I couldn?t believe you didn?t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
L487977	u7470	m505	GALE	Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
L487976	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
L487975	u7470	m505	GALE	No, I don't.
L487974	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
L487973	u7470	m505	GALE	Why don't you ask them?
L487972	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	And are the police sure about that?
L487971	u7470	m505	GALE	Home--where he lives.
L487970	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Where is Sidney's father?
L487969	u7470	m505	GALE	Tons and tons.
L487968	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Hi, Gale, any leads?
L487703	u7470	m505	GALE	Good for you.
L487702	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
L487701	u7470	m505	GALE	Do I know you? You look familiar.
L487700	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	And much richer as a result.
L487699	u7470	m505	GALE	Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
L487698	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
L487697	u7470	m505	GALE	Fair enough.
L487696	u7467	m505	DEBBIE SALT	Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
L487695	u7470	m505	GALE	Look, I'm sorry about the face.
L488230	u7478	m505	MICKEY	You freakin?
L488229	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah.
L488228	u7478	m505	MICKEY	No way.
L488227	u7468	m505	DEREK	She dumped me.
L488226	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Where's Sid?
L488225	u7468	m505	DEREK	Not one bit.
L488224	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
L488075	u7468	m505	DEREK	Definitely Whitney.
L488074	u7478	m505	MICKEY	And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY.
L488073	u7468	m505	DEREK	I think he's doing Dolly.
L488061	u7468	m505	DEREK	Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
L488060	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I could use some therapy.
L488039	u7468	m505	DEREK	I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
L488038	u7478	m505	MICKEY	What's your subject?
L488037	u7468	m505	DEREK	My documentary is due on Tuesday.
L487732	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
L487731	u7468	m505	DEREK	How do you put up with this Greek shit?
L488447	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	But nobody wants to see that. It?ll never go. They?ll rewrite you. You don?t want that.
L488446	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah, we?re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I?m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It?s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
L488413	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You?re not going to get away with this.
L488412	u7468	m505	DEREK	Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
L488393	u7468	m505	DEREK	Good question. You took the bait.
L488392	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Why?
L488381	u7468	m505	DEREK	That?s quick.
L488380	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No. This is a set up.
L488379	u7468	m505	DEREK	Go on, untie him.
L488124	u7468	m505	DEREK	Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
L488123	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
L488122	u7468	m505	DEREK	I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
L488121	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No, it's not.
L488120	u7468	m505	DEREK	I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
L487966	u7468	m505	DEREK	It's under control.
L487965	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
L487964	u7468	m505	DEREK	Let us decide that.
L487963	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
L487960	u7468	m505	DEREK	I think it's out of your control.
L487959	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	This is exactly what I don't want.
L487892	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'll get my jacket.
L487891	u7468	m505	DEREK	Lemme take you home.
L487877	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	The forbidden subject.
L487876	u7468	m505	DEREK	About what?
L487871	u7468	m505	DEREK	I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
L487870	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
L487729	u7468	m505	DEREK	Sid, you don't have to.
L487728	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
L487688	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
L487687	u7468	m505	DEREK	I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
L487686	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	"I skipped. Too many ""That's her"" looks."
L487685	u7468	m505	DEREK	How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
L488462	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Tuition?s expensive.
L488461	u7468	m505	DEREK	We had to have financing.
L488430	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Tails.
L488429	u7468	m505	DEREK	Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It?s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
L488428	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
L488427	u7468	m505	DEREK	Just for you, Sid.
L488426	u7472	m505	HALLIE	We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
L488425	u7468	m505	DEREK	Or it found us.
L488424	u7472	m505	HALLIE	So we found a compromise.
L488423	u7468	m505	DEREK	And we didn?t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money?s worth.
L488422	u7472	m505	HALLIE	..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
L488421	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing?s been done.
L488420	u7472	m505	HALLIE	A twist ending if you will.
L488419	u7468	m505	DEREK	Hope you?re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
L488418	u7472	m505	HALLIE	And now, drum roll please...
L488417	u7468	m505	DEREK	We?re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
L488416	u7472	m505	HALLIE	A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
L488415	u7468	m505	DEREK	The way I see it. We?ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
L488414	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Of course not. Who wants to? What?s the point if we don?t get caught? Where?s the glamour in that?
L488409	u7468	m505	DEREK	Until now.
L488408	u7472	m505	HALLIE	You?re the one who got away.
L488407	u7468	m505	DEREK	You?d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It?s a whole world, Sid. You?re really popular amongst the demented.
L488406	u7472	m505	HALLIE	We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
L488405	u7468	m505	DEREK	I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
L488404	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He sent me the cutest e-mail.
L488397	u7468	m505	DEREK	I find his work overwrought.
L488396	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He hates Oliver Stone.
L488395	u7468	m505	DEREK	I really don?t like that comparison, honey.
L488394	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
L488391	u7468	m505	DEREK	Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
L488390	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
L488388	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I got it..
L488387	u7468	m505	DEREK	Need some help, honey.
L488063	u7468	m505	DEREK	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
L488062	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He seemed harmless.
L488051	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Randy somebody.
L488050	u7468	m505	DEREK	What guy?
L488049	u7472	m505	HALLIE	She's got guards with her.
L488046	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
L488045	u7468	m505	DEREK	You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
L488044	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Damned if I know. She ditched me.
L488043	u7468	m505	DEREK	Where's Sid?
L487953	u7468	m505	DEREK	And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
L487952	u7472	m505	HALLIE	So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
L487951	u7468	m505	DEREK	Two.
L488327	u7469	m505	DEWEY	There's nothing. I'm coming down.
L488326	u7470	m505	GALE	Dewey?
L488323	u7469	m505	DEWEY	No, wait here.
L488322	u7470	m505	GALE	Let's go.
L488318	u7469	m505	DEWEY	He filmed his victims.
L488317	u7470	m505	GALE	Jesus Christ!
L488314	u7469	m505	DEWEY	C'mon. Let's go.
L488313	u7470	m505	GALE	Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
L488311	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Over here.
L488310	u7470	m505	GALE	This is all too familiar.
L488309	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Let's find out.
L488308	u7470	m505	GALE	Ssshh! What was that?
L488292	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Hallie?
L488291	u7470	m505	GALE	Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
L488290	u7469	m505	DEWEY	The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
L488289	u7470	m505	GALE	And Joel's pre-med.
L488288	u7469	m505	DEWEY	They're roomates.
L488286	u7469	m505	DEWEY	We'd break some furniture.
L488285	u7470	m505	GALE	..and as lonely as I am...
L488284	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
L488283	u7470	m505	GALE	Dewey, you and I would never make it.
L488282	u7469	m505	DEWEY	And it's sexier in the dark.
L488281	u7469	m505	DEWEY	That's not the way it's done.
L488280	u7470	m505	GALE	Can we turn the light on?
L488279	u7469	m505	DEWEY	A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
L488278	u7470	m505	GALE	What are we looking for?
L488277	u7469	m505	DEWEY	You broke my heart.
L488271	u7470	m505	GALE	Billy had alibis too.
L488270	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
L488269	u7470	m505	GALE	He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
L488268	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Meaning?
L488267	u7470	m505	GALE	If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
L488194	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Not good.
L488193	u7470	m505	GALE	Not good. How you doin?
L488135	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
L488134	u7470	m505	GALE	Yeah?
L488133	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I know that.
L488132	u7470	m505	GALE	And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
L488131	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I think you're all an act.
L488130	u7469	m505	DEWEY	You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
L488129	u7470	m505	GALE	Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
L488128	u7469	m505	DEWEY	So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
L487751	u7469	m505	DEWEY	No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
L487750	u7470	m505	GALE	I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
L487749	u7469	m505	DEWEY	How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
L487748	u7470	m505	GALE	I never meant to imply...
L487747	u7469	m505	DEWEY	"Page 41. ""Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."""
L487746	u7470	m505	GALE	You have every right to be upset.
L487745	u7469	m505	DEWEY	No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
L487744	u7470	m505	GALE	Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
L487743	u7469	m505	DEWEY	"Page 32. ""Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence."" I think you've explained yourself."
L487742	u7470	m505	GALE	And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
L487741	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
L487740	u7470	m505	GALE	I see you read the book.
L487739	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
L487737	u7469	m505	DEWEY	I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
L487736	u7470	m505	GALE	I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
L487735	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Miss Weathers.
L487734	u7470	m505	GALE	Hello, Dwight.
L488273	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Whatever.
L488272	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
L488249	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Humor me, Sid.
L488248	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Dewey, there's no such place.
L488247	u7469	m505	DEWEY	The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
L487654	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
L487653	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Just in case...
L487652	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
L487651	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Don't worry...
L487650	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
L487647	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
L487646	u7469	m505	DEWEY	Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
L487645	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Yeah, right.
L487644	u7469	m505	DEWEY	As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
L487643	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
L487642	u7469	m505	DEWEY	They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
L487641	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Oh my God. How could it happen?
L487640	u7469	m505	DEWEY	They thought it was a publicity stunt.
L487639	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
L487998	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Watch your back.
L487997	u7470	m505	GALE	No, wait...
L487996	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
L487995	u7470	m505	GALE	You're getting obvious.
L487994	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
L487993	u7470	m505	GALE	What do you mean?
L487992	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	It's what you want from me.
L487991	u7470	m505	GALE	What do you want from me?
L487990	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Stay away from the cop.
L487989	u7470	m505	GALE	Oh--a God complex
L487988	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	I'm everywhere.
L487987	u7470	m505	GALE	Where are you?
L487986	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	You're pretty when you're angry.
L487985	u7470	m505	GALE	What do you want?
L487984	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	What if your life depended on it?
L487983	u7470	m505	GALE	I don't play games.
L487982	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	That's not the way we play the game.
L487981	u7470	m505	GALE	Who are you?
L487980	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	I'll give you one guess.
L487979	u7470	m505	GALE	Who is this?
L488454	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Oh my God.
L488453	u7470	m505	GALE	What?
L488253	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	But who would operate your camera?
L488252	u7470	m505	GALE	Sid, I'll come with you.
L487763	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	My morn was a Delta.
L487762	u7470	m505	GALE	It's good to see you involved.
L487761	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
L487760	u7470	m505	GALE	It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
L487759	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
L487758	u7470	m505	GALE	I'm sorry.
L487757	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
L487756	u7470	m505	GALE	Sidney. Hello. How are you?
L488369	u7470	m505	GALE	The safety what? Fuck that!
L488368	u7485	m505	VOICE	Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
L488367	u7470	m505	GALE	I don?t know.
L488366	u7485	m505	VOICE	Where is your attacker?
L488365	u7470	m505	GALE	Yes, goddammit!
L488364	u7485	m505	VOICE	Are you in danger now?
L488363	u7470	m505	GALE	Someone?s trying to kill me. I need the police.
L488079	u7478	m505	MICKEY	But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
L488078	u7472	m505	HALLIE	You're going to get it. You know what happens.
L488072	u7478	m505	MICKEY	And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you.
L488071	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Don't do this.
L488070	u7478	m505	MICKEY	"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
L488069	u7472	m505	HALLIE	What?
L488068	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I got a surprise for you.
L488056	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Is Sid in therapy?
L488055	u7472	m505	HALLIE	He tried to kill her first.
L487958	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Too bad.
L487957	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
L487956	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
L487715	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I have to watch rehearsal.
L487714	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I have rehearsal.
L487677	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
L487676	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
L488449	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
L488448	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Oh, Sid, you?re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
L488258	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's not a good idea, Hallie.
L488257	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I'm the only one who can cut him down.
L488251	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
L488250	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Can I come with her?
L488246	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'd really just like to be alone.
L488245	u7472	m505	HALLIE	It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
L488236	u7472	m505	HALLIE	No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
L488235	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
L488234	u7472	m505	HALLIE	We're missing the Sig Ep party.
L488012	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
L488011	u7472	m505	HALLIE	No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
L488010	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
L488009	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Who is that guy?
L488006	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Yeah, right.
L488005	u7472	m505	HALLIE	That was good.
L487950	u7472	m505	HALLIE	I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
L487949	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Gotta.
L487948	u7472	m505	HALLIE	What about rehearsal?
L487947	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Please, I have the perfect excuse.
L487946	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
L487623	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
L487622	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Time to change numbers again?
L487614	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Hello?  Hello?
L487613	u7472	m505	HALLIE	Knock yourself out.
L487604	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
L487603	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The young girl is slashed again.
L487602	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS Sit down."" Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised."
L487601	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
L487598	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
L487597	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
L487591	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
L487590	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
L487584	u7473	m505	IN THE THEATER	"The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. ""You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."" etc."
L487583	u7480	m505	ON SCREEN	A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
L488066	u7474	m505	JOEL	It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
L488065	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Easy black boy.
L488064	u7474	m505	JOEL	And white.
L488054	u7474	m505	JOEL	No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
L488053	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Her old boyfriend?
L488052	u7474	m505	JOEL	Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
L488048	u7474	m505	JOEL	Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
L488047	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I've been waiting for you, baby.
L487945	u7478	m505	MICKEY	I counted four.
L487944	u7474	m505	JOEL	How many guys they have on you?
L487962	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	But...
L487961	u7474	m505	JOEL	Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
L487955	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
L487954	u7474	m505	JOEL	Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
L487719	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Thanks, Joel.
L487718	u7474	m505	JOEL	I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
L487717	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	You're not allowed to ask that.
L487716	u7474	m505	JOEL	I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
L487713	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
L487712	u7474	m505	JOEL	Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
L488222	u7475	m505	LOIS	I just love being a sister.
L488221	u7479	m505	MURPHY	..harmonica style is okay.
L488220	u7475	m505	LOIS	..it's really about family and tradition...
L488219	u7479	m505	MURPHY	..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
L488218	u7475	m505	LOIS	It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
L487725	u7479	m505	MURPHY	We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
L487724	u7475	m505	LOIS	Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
L487723	u7479	m505	MURPHY	..this week's TKE kegger...
L488157	u7482	m505	RANDY	"Gee, let me think. ""Do you want to..."" Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add."
L488156	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Do you want to die?
L488151	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Closer than you think.
L488150	u7482	m505	RANDY	SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
L488149	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	What's your favorite scary movie?
L488148	u7482	m505	RANDY	What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
L488143	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	But she's standing right next to you.
L488142	u7482	m505	RANDY	She's not here right now.
L488141	u7476	m505	MAN'S VOICE	Gale?
L488140	u7482	m505	RANDY	Hello?
L487577	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
L487576	u7481	m505	PHIL	We can still Sandra Bullock it.
L487575	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
L487574	u7481	m505	PHIL	You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
L487573	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	I get scared really easy, okay.
L487572	u7481	m505	PHIL	Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
L487571	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	You are so not funny.
L487570	u7481	m505	PHIL	I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
L487569	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	You ass.
L487562	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
L487561	u7481	m505	PHIL	Shush.
L487560	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
L487549	u7481	m505	PHIL	Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
L487548	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
L487545	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	Now.
L487544	u7481	m505	PHIL	But...
L487543	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	Take it off.
L487536	u7481	m505	PHIL	We got free tickets.
L487535	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
L487534	u7481	m505	PHIL	It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
L487533	u7477	m505	MAUREEN	I hate scary movies.
L488356	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Don't panic.
L488355	u7478	m505	MICKEY	What was that?
L488352	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Where you going?
L488351	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I'll be right back.
L488349	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	He's after me.
L488348	u7478	m505	MICKEY	What are you talking about?
L488347	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
L488346	u7478	m505	MICKEY	Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
L488119	u7482	m505	RANDY	Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
L488118	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Thanks for the movie, Randy.
L488117	u7482	m505	RANDY	I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
L488116	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
L488115	u7482	m505	RANDY	I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
L488114	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
L488113	u7482	m505	RANDY	If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
L488017	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Me, too. Randy. Me too.
L488016	u7482	m505	RANDY	Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
L488015	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	Do you work for her now?
L488014	u7482	m505	RANDY	I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
L488013	u7484	m505	SIDNEY	What do you want?
L488596	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
L488595	u7499	m506	TYSON	Melinda McGraw?
L488594	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
L488589	u7499	m506	TYSON	And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
L488588	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
L488587	u7499	m506	TYSON	Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
L488586	u7486	m506	ANGELINA	I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
L488506	u7487	m506	BEN	Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
L488505	u7489	m506	CHRISTINE	I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
L488504	u7487	m506	BEN	Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
L488503	u7489	m506	CHRISTINE	All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
L488502	u7487	m506	BEN	Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
L488501	u7489	m506	CHRISTINE	No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
L488553	u7487	m506	BEN	Reaction to what?
L488552	u7500	m506	VOICE	To see your reaction.
L488551	u7487	m506	BEN	Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
L488550	u7500	m506	VOICE	Closer than you think.
L488549	u7487	m506	BEN	Where are you?
L488548	u7500	m506	VOICE	Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
L488547	u7487	m506	BEN	Yeah.
L488545	u7500	m506	VOICE	No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
L488544	u7487	m506	BEN	I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
L488543	u7500	m506	VOICE	You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
L488541	u7500	m506	VOICE	Good bye Ben.
L488540	u7487	m506	BEN	What?!
L488539	u7500	m506	VOICE	That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
L488538	u7487	m506	BEN	What?! But I did everything you said to do!
L488537	u7500	m506	VOICE	Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
L488536	u7487	m506	BEN	It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
L488534	u7500	m506	VOICE	Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
L488533	u7487	m506	BEN	I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
L488532	u7500	m506	VOICE	You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
L488531	u7487	m506	BEN	What kind of a game?
L488530	u7500	m506	VOICE	More of a game really.
L488529	u7487	m506	BEN	Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
L488528	u7500	m506	VOICE	I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
L488527	u7487	m506	BEN	What do you mean?
L488526	u7500	m506	VOICE	Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
L488525	u7487	m506	BEN	Thanks.
L488524	u7500	m506	VOICE	Really? You're such a talented actor.
L488523	u7487	m506	BEN	Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
L488522	u7500	m506	VOICE	You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
L488520	u7500	m506	VOICE	But your voice sounds so familiar.
L488519	u7487	m506	BEN	Asshole, Can't talk.
L488518	u7500	m506	VOICE	Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
L488517	u7487	m506	BEN	Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
L488516	u7500	m506	VOICE	Do I?
L488515	u7487	m506	BEN	I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
L488514	u7500	m506	VOICE	I don't know.
L488513	u7487	m506	BEN	Well what number are you trying to reach?
L488512	u7500	m506	VOICE	Who is this?
L488511	u7487	m506	BEN	Who is this?
L488510	u7500	m506	VOICE	Hello.
L488509	u7487	m506	BEN	Jesus.  Hello?
L488947	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
L488946	u7492	m506	GALE	What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
L488943	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
L488942	u7492	m506	GALE	It may be Maureen Reynolds --
L488941	u7488	m506	BIANCA	I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
L488936	u7492	m506	GALE	Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
L488935	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
L488934	u7492	m506	GALE	Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
L488933	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Nope.
L488932	u7492	m506	GALE	Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
L488931	u7488	m506	BIANCA	I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
L488930	u7492	m506	GALE	I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
L488929	u7488	m506	BIANCA	Can I help you?
L489067	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
L489066	u7492	m506	GALE	He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
L489065	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Jesus Gale what happened?
L488853	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
L488852	u7492	m506	GALE	Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
L488841	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
L488840	u7492	m506	GALE	OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
L488837	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
L488836	u7492	m506	GALE	Four? There are five.
L488833	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
L488832	u7492	m506	GALE	But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
L488831	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
L488715	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
L488714	u7492	m506	GALE	Please, call me Gale.
L488713	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
L488712	u7492	m506	GALE	But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
L488711	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
L488710	u7492	m506	GALE	Who?
L488709	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
L488708	u7492	m506	GALE	Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
L488707	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
L488635	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
L488634	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
L488633	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
L488632	u7492	m506	GALE	Alright Kincaid, no where to?
L488579	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	And who would that be?
L488578	u7492	m506	GALE	I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
L488577	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
L488576	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	There's more.
L488575	u7492	m506	GALE	That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
L488574	u7492	m506	GALE	A note?
L488573	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
L488572	u7492	m506	GALE	So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
L488571	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
L488570	u7492	m506	GALE	Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
L488569	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
L488568	u7492	m506	GALE	Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
L489033	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Catch him, or kill him.
L489032	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Oh yeah, how?
L489031	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
L489030	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	How is that good news?
L489029	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
L489028	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
L489027	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	What did you know about your mother?
L489026	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Hmm.
L489025	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
L489024	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
L489023	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
L489022	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	What do you mean?
L489021	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
L489020	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Excuse me?
L489019	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	To me Hollywood is about death.
L489018	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
L489017	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
L489016	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Did you request this case?
L489015	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
L489014	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
L489013	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
L489012	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	You seem to like movies, Detective.
L489011	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	You mean like, movie trilogies?
L489010	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	What do you know about trilogies?
L488887	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Absolutely.
L488886	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Are you sure?
L488883	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
L488882	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
L488980	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
L488979	u7491	m506	DEWEY	And what made you think it was Sidney?
L488978	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
L488876	u7491	m506	DEWEY	No.
L488875	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
L488874	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
L488871	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	What?  When?
L488870	u7491	m506	DEWEY	The killer called her.
L488869	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
L488864	u7491	m506	DEWEY	There's someone here who wants to help.
L488863	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	What Rielly?
L488862	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Detective Kincaid?
L488851	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Is that a threat?
L488850	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
L488849	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Is that a threat, Detective?
L488846	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
L488845	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
L488844	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What does this have to do with Sid?
L488843	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
L488839	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
L488838	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
L488835	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
L488834	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
L488615	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
L488614	u7490	m506	DETECTIVE KINCAID	That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
L488608	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Yeah. A real tragedy.
L489166	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
L489165	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
L489163	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
L489162	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
L489161	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
L489133	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
L489132	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	They've got her!
L489131	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Where's Gale?
L489115	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
L489114	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Where are you Dewey?
L489113	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sid I can see you!
L489112	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
L489111	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
L489110	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yeah?
L488960	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
L488959	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
L488952	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
L488951	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
L488950	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
L488908	u7491	m506	DEWEY	No.
L488907	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I can see nothing's changed.
L488893	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
L488892	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
L488889	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
L488888	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
L488885	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
L488884	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
L488861	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Follow me.
L488860	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
L488859	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What?
L488858	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
L488857	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
L489170	u7492	m506	GALE	Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
L489169	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
L489058	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Who is it?
L489057	u7492	m506	GALE	Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
L488967	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Nevermind, what'd you two find?
L488966	u7492	m506	GALE	Sidney, what happened?
L488906	u7492	m506	GALE	I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
L488905	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Do you want us to come with you?
L488904	u7492	m506	GALE	I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
L488880	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Just Jennifer.  And you.
L488879	u7492	m506	GALE	Has anyone else every used your phone?
L488878	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
L488877	u7492	m506	GALE	Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
L488868	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
L488867	u7492	m506	GALE	Thank you.
L488825	u7491	m506	DEWEY	GALE BEHIND YOU!
L488824	u7492	m506	GALE	What?
L488823	u7491	m506	DEWEY	OH. OH GOD. GALE --
L488805	u7492	m506	GALE	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
L488804	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
L488774	u7492	m506	GALE	Fuck!
L488773	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Gale, your engine's still running.
L488772	u7492	m506	GALE	Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
L488771	u7491	m506	DEWEY	You're not a detective.
L488770	u7492	m506	GALE	I happen to work for the police god dammit!
L488769	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Stop following me.
L488768	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I'm on duty.
L488767	u7492	m506	GALE	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
L488766	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Jennifer needs me.
L488765	u7492	m506	GALE	And who is that?
L488764	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
L488763	u7492	m506	GALE	Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
L488762	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
L488761	u7492	m506	GALE	I'm sorry, this is too good!
L488760	u7491	m506	DEWEY	I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
L488759	u7492	m506	GALE	Someone stole Sid's file?
L488758	u7491	m506	DEWEY	The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
L488757	u7492	m506	GALE	And?
L488756	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
L488755	u7492	m506	GALE	Always.
L488754	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Off the record.
L488753	u7492	m506	GALE	All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
L488752	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
L488751	u7492	m506	GALE	Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
L488750	u7491	m506	DEWEY	You used to say that was our strength.
L488749	u7492	m506	GALE	It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
L488748	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
L488747	u7492	m506	GALE	It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
L488746	u7491	m506	DEWEY	So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
L488745	u7492	m506	GALE	You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
L488744	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What about me?
L488743	u7492	m506	GALE	Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
L488742	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Why would the police come to you?
L488741	u7492	m506	GALE	Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
L488740	u7491	m506	DEWEY	Do you really mean it this time Gale?
L488739	u7492	m506	GALE	This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
L488738	u7491	m506	DEWEY	You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
L488737	u7492	m506	GALE	Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
L488736	u7491	m506	DEWEY	They found another note?
L488611	u7492	m506	GALE	Show him.
L488610	u7491	m506	DEWEY	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
L488609	u7492	m506	GALE	Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
L488999	u7494	m506	MILTON	"When we did the first 'Stab"" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?"
L488998	u7491	m506	DEWEY	But you know who she was.
L488997	u7494	m506	MILTON	What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
L488994	u7494	m506	MILTON	I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
L488993	u7491	m506	DEWEY	No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
L488992	u7494	m506	MILTON	What's your point?
L488985	u7494	m506	MILTON	Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
L488984	u7491	m506	DEWEY	So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
L488567	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Sure.
L488566	u7492	m506	GALE	Would you excuse me for a moment?
L488565	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
L488564	u7492	m506	GALE	Your life?
L488563	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Honestly, my life.
L488561	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
L488560	u7492	m506	GALE	It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
L488559	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
L489042	u7492	m506	GALE	Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
L489041	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
L489040	u7492	m506	GALE	Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
L489039	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
L488996	u7492	m506	GALE	Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
L488995	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
L488991	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Good twist.
L488990	u7492	m506	GALE	Nobody said she was an actor.
L488928	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Bitch.
L488927	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
L488926	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
L488925	u7492	m506	GALE	Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
L488924	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Basements creep me out.
L488923	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Gale Weathers would find a way. 
L488922	u7492	m506	GALE	Possibly.
L488921	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	There a story in that building?
L488920	u7492	m506	GALE	No really?
L488919	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Need to get in that building?
L488918	u7492	m506	GALE	Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
L488917	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	That's funny.
L488916	u7492	m506	GALE	And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
L488915	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
L488914	u7492	m506	GALE	None.
L488913	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
L488912	u7492	m506	GALE	I am Gale Weathers!
L488911	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
L488910	u7492	m506	GALE	What the hell are you doing?
L488909	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Geez.
L488821	u7492	m506	GALE	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
L488820	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
L488818	u7492	m506	GALE	I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
L488817	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
L488816	u7492	m506	GALE	Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
L488811	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Oh shit it's my cell!
L488810	u7492	m506	GALE	Who's phone?
L488798	u7492	m506	GALE	I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
L488797	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
L488788	u7492	m506	GALE	Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
L488787	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
L488786	u7492	m506	GALE	AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
L488785	u7492	m506	GALE	Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
L488784	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
L488783	u7492	m506	GALE	Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
L488782	u7493	m506	JENNIFER	You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
L489009	u7494	m506	MILTON	I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
L489008	u7492	m506	GALE	Are you saying she was-
L489007	u7494	m506	MILTON	It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
L489006	u7492	m506	GALE	Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
L489005	u7494	m506	MILTON	Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
L489004	u7492	m506	GALE	I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
L489003	u7494	m506	MILTON	Yeah.
L489002	u7492	m506	GALE	Just because you knew her?
L489001	u7494	m506	MILTON	Get real, that would make me a suspect!
L489000	u7492	m506	GALE	And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
L488987	u7494	m506	MILTON	Who?
L488986	u7492	m506	GALE	Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
L488631	u7492	m506	GALE	They're the ones who approved it.
L488630	u7494	m506	MILTON	Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
L488629	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh come on! Why the hostility?
L488628	u7494	m506	MILTON	Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
L488625	u7494	m506	MILTON	GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
L488624	u7492	m506	GALE	Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
L488781	u7498	m506	TOM	You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
L488780	u7492	m506	GALE	I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
L488779	u7498	m506	TOM	Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
L488778	u7492	m506	GALE	Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
L488777	u7498	m506	TOM	Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
L488776	u7492	m506	GALE	Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
L488775	u7498	m506	TOM	Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
L489126	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	GALE WATCHOUT!
L489125	u7492	m506	GALE	Let's get out of here!
L489124	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I know!
L489123	u7492	m506	GALE	I know! He killed Kincaid!
L489122	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Gale he's got Dewey!
L488969	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	What are you talking about?
L488968	u7492	m506	GALE	We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
L488891	u7492	m506	GALE	Who's this.
L488890	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
L488873	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	"Oh, you know, the usual small talk, ""What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"""
L488872	u7492	m506	GALE	What'd he say?
L488866	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
L488865	u7492	m506	GALE	Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
L489156	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
L489155	u7495	m506	ROMAN	See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
L489152	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
L489151	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
L489150	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
L489147	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
L489146	u7495	m506	ROMAN	I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
L489145	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
L489144	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
L488702	u7495	m506	ROMAN	My movie.
L488701	u7496	m506	SARAH	What?  What movie?
L488700	u7495	m506	ROMAN	It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
L488699	u7496	m506	SARAH	Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
L488698	u7495	m506	ROMAN	It is in my script.
L488697	u7496	m506	SARAH	Roman that's not the line.
L488696	u7495	m506	ROMAN	It's Sarah.
L488695	u7496	m506	SARAH	I'm hanging up right now.
L488694	u7495	m506	ROMAN	But you know my favorite name?
L488693	u7496	m506	SARAH	Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
L488692	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
L488691	u7496	m506	SARAH	This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
L488690	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Who's this?
L488689	u7496	m506	SARAH	Who's this?
L488688	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Hello.
L488687	u7496	m506	SARAH	Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
L488686	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Page 22, Candy's big moment.
L488685	u7496	m506	SARAH	Huh, fine.
L488684	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
L488683	u7496	m506	SARAH	I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
L488682	u7495	m506	ROMAN	You're not happy with your part.
L488681	u7496	m506	SARAH	What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
L488680	u7495	m506	ROMAN	All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
L488679	u7496	m506	SARAH	Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
L488678	u7495	m506	ROMAN	Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
L488677	u7496	m506	SARAH	Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
L488674	u7496	m506	SARAH	Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
L488673	u7499	m506	TYSON	No.
L488672	u7496	m506	SARAH	Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
L488671	u7499	m506	TYSON	Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
L488593	u7499	m506	TYSON	I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
L488592	u7496	m506	SARAH	Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
L488591	u7499	m506	TYSON	"SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. ""What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident""."
L488590	u7496	m506	SARAH	What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
L488585	u7499	m506	TYSON	And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
L488584	u7496	m506	SARAH	Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
L489109	u7500	m506	VOICE	It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
L489108	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
L489107	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I thought you wanted me here?
L489106	u7500	m506	VOICE	You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
L489105	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Alright, I'm here. Now what?
L489104	u7500	m506	VOICE	You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
L489103	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yeah?
L489101	u7500	m506	VOICE	I'll call you, when you're on your way.
L489100	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	WHERE?
L489099	u7500	m506	VOICE	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
L489098	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Where?
L489093	u7500	m506	VOICE	I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
L489092	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	You're dead!
L489088	u7500	m506	VOICE	Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
L489087	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	How do I know their voices are --
L489086	u7500	m506	VOICE	Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
L489085	u7500	m506	VOICE	Go there.
L489084	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yes.
L489083	u7500	m506	VOICE	Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
L489081	u7500	m506	VOICE	The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
L489080	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Who is this?
L489079	u7500	m506	VOICE	{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
L488663	u7500	m506	VOICE	Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
L488662	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
L488661	u7500	m506	VOICE	No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
L488660	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	The final act? Well let's play asshole!
L488659	u7500	m506	VOICE	Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
L488658	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
L488657	u7500	m506	VOICE	Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
L488656	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
L488655	u7500	m506	VOICE	I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
L488654	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	W-what do you want?
L488653	u7500	m506	VOICE	Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
L488651	u7501	m506	WOMAN	It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
L488650	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Who the fuck is this?
L488649	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
L488648	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	I'm sorry, your voice.
L488647	u7501	m506	WOMAN	No I need to call you. Just you.
L488646	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Well then the people you need to call are the police.
L488645	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
L488644	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Are you sure?
L488643	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Laura I think I just killed somebody.
L488642	u7497	m506	SIDNEY	Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
L488641	u7501	m506	WOMAN	Hello?
L487514	u7516	m507	STU	I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
L487513	u7502	m507	BILLY	FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
L487507	u7502	m507	BILLY	Where the fuck did she go?
L487506	u7516	m507	STU	I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
L487503	u7516	m507	STU	Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
L487502	u7502	m507	BILLY	She can't get both of us.
L487499	u7516	m507	STU	She looked dead. Still does.
L487498	u7502	m507	BILLY	I thought she was dead.
L487495	u7516	m507	STU	No, it's not.
L487494	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's on the table.
L487492	u7502	m507	BILLY	Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
L487491	u7516	m507	STU	That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
L487488	u7516	m507	STU	Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
L487487	u7502	m507	BILLY	And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
L487486	u7516	m507	STU	Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
L487485	u7502	m507	BILLY	What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
L487477	u7516	m507	STU	Yeah...
L487476	u7502	m507	BILLY	Ready?
L487475	u7502	m507	BILLY	You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
L487474	u7516	m507	STU	This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
L487472	u7516	m507	STU	That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
L487471	u7502	m507	BILLY	Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
L487465	u7502	m507	BILLY	And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
L487464	u7516	m507	STU	Nope.
L487461	u7516	m507	STU	Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
L487460	u7502	m507	BILLY	Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
L487456	u7516	m507	STU	And if you get it right -- you die.
L487455	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
L487454	u7516	m507	STU	You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
L487444	u7516	m507	STU	Oh yeah.
L487443	u7502	m507	BILLY	Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
L487307	u7502	m507	BILLY	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
L487306	u7516	m507	STU	Dude. What are you doing here?
L487165	u7516	m507	STU	You know it.
L487164	u7502	m507	BILLY	You ready to party hard tonight?
L487163	u7516	m507	STU	Oh...
L487162	u7502	m507	BILLY	Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
L487161	u7516	m507	STU	I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
L487160	u7502	m507	BILLY	Duh... that's quick.
L487159	u7516	m507	STU	So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
L487158	u7502	m507	BILLY	Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
L487157	u7516	m507	STU	Piece of cake. She'll be there.
L487156	u7502	m507	BILLY	How'd you do?
L487050	u7516	m507	STU	Sorry.
L487049	u7502	m507	BILLY	You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
L487048	u7516	m507	STU	Owwww...
L486805	u7502	m507	BILLY	No one's saying you did.
L486804	u7516	m507	STU	I didn't kill anybody.
L486787	u7516	m507	STU	Sorry.
L486786	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's called tact, you fuckrag.
L486785	u7516	m507	STU	What? She asked.
L486920	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
L486919	u7502	m507	BILLY	No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
L486918	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
L486915	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
L486914	u7502	m507	BILLY	Yes, sir.
L486913	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	You rode your bike out there?
L486912	u7502	m507	BILLY	I just wanted to see her, that's all.
L486911	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
L487518	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
L487517	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
L487511	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
L487510	u7502	m507	BILLY	You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
L487509	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Are you alone in the house?
L487508	u7502	m507	BILLY	Hello?
L487483	u7502	m507	BILLY	Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
L487482	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Stop it!
L487481	u7502	m507	BILLY	Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
L487467	u7502	m507	BILLY	We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
L487466	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I don't understand...
L487463	u7502	m507	BILLY	Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
L487462	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why did you kill my mother?
L487453	u7502	m507	BILLY	We already played that game. You lost, remember?
L487452	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Fuck you.
L487451	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
L487434	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's okay. Give me the gun.
L487433	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	NO! Don't believe him.
L487430	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
L487429	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I thought you were...
L487379	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
L487378	u7502	m507	BILLY	You don't still think it was me?
L487377	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Uh-huh.
L487376	u7502	m507	BILLY	Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
L487375	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
L487374	u7502	m507	BILLY	I called my dad.
L487373	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
L487372	u7502	m507	BILLY	What?
L487371	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Who did you call?
L487337	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Yeah... I think so.
L487336	u7502	m507	BILLY	Are you serious?
L487335	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You heard me.
L487334	u7502	m507	BILLY	What?
L487333	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Or even a good porno.
L487332	u7502	m507	BILLY	Sshh... it's okay.
L487330	u7502	m507	BILLY	Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
L487329	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I wanna let go. I do...
L487328	u7502	m507	BILLY	Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
L487327	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But this is life. This isn't a movie.
L487326	u7502	m507	BILLY	Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
L487325	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
L487324	u7502	m507	BILLY	Oh Sidney...
L487323	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
L487322	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
L487321	u7502	m507	BILLY	You lost your mom...
L487320	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
L487319	u7502	m507	BILLY	So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
L487318	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So...
L487311	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's okay. We need to talk.
L487310	u7502	m507	BILLY	Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
L487070	u7502	m507	BILLY	You have to move on, Sid.
L487069	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
L487068	u7502	m507	BILLY	When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
L487067	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
L487066	u7502	m507	BILLY	It's been a year since she died.
L487065	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
L487064	u7502	m507	BILLY	Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
L487063	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No...
L487062	u7502	m507	BILLY	Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
L487061	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You know that's not true.
L487060	u7502	m507	BILLY	Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
L487059	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'm so sorry... please understand.
L487058	u7502	m507	BILLY	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
L487057	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
L487056	u7502	m507	BILLY	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
L487055	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
L487053	u7502	m507	BILLY	Hey, hey, it's just me.
L487052	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Jesus, SHIT!
L486865	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	He's here. He's trying to kill me...
L486864	u7502	m507	BILLY	I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
L486863	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Oh Billy... Please... God...
L486741	u7502	m507	BILLY	What's that?
L486740	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
L486737	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm going... I'm going.
L486736	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You know what my dad will do to you?
L486733	u7502	m507	BILLY	No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
L486732	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
L486731	u7502	m507	BILLY	"Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid ""R"" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television."
L486730	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Oh it did?
L486729	u7502	m507	BILLY	And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
L486728	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Now that it's out of your system.
L486727	u7502	m507	BILLY	It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
L486726	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What are you doing here?
L486725	u7502	m507	BILLY	Close call.
L486712	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'll only stay a sec.
L486711	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	My dad's in the other room.
L486710	u7502	m507	BILLY	You sleep in THAT?
L486709	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What are you doing here?
L486708	u7502	m507	BILLY	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
L486707	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Billy? What the...
L486688	u7510	m507	MAN	Your call.
L486687	u7503	m507	CASEY	Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
L486686	u7510	m507	MAN	There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
L486685	u7503	m507	CASEY	What?
L486684	u7510	m507	MAN	What door am I at?
L486683	u7510	m507	MAN	Answer the question and I will.
L486682	u7503	m507	CASEY	...leave me alone... please...
L486680	u7510	m507	MAN	Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
L486679	u7503	m507	CASEY	You tricked me...
L486678	u7510	m507	MAN	Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
L486677	u7503	m507	CASEY	It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
L486676	u7510	m507	MAN	Afraid not.
L486675	u7503	m507	CASEY	No it's not. It was Jason.
L486674	u7510	m507	MAN	I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
L486672	u7510	m507	MAN	Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
L486671	u7503	m507	CASEY	...please... no...
L486670	u7510	m507	MAN	Then answer the question. Same category.
L486669	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please go away! Leave us alone!
L486668	u7510	m507	MAN	But you're doing so well.
L486667	u7503	m507	CASEY	NOOOO....
L486666	u7510	m507	MAN	Now for the real question.
L486665	u7510	m507	MAN	YES!
L486664	u7503	m507	CASEY	Michael... Michael Myers.
L486662	u7503	m507	CASEY	I can't think.
L486661	u7510	m507	MAN	What's his name?
L486660	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please..stop...
L486659	u7510	m507	MAN	Come on, yes you do.
L486658	u7503	m507	CASEY	I don't know...
L486657	u7510	m507	MAN	Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
L486656	u7503	m507	CASEY	No...
L486655	u7510	m507	MAN	Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
L486654	u7503	m507	CASEY	Don't do this. I can't...
L486653	u7510	m507	MAN	I'll even give you a warm up question.
L486652	u7503	m507	CASEY	...please...
L486651	u7510	m507	MAN	It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
L486650	u7503	m507	CASEY	No... please.
L486649	u7510	m507	MAN	Come on. It'll be fun.
L486648	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please don't do this...
L486646	u7510	m507	MAN	Turn off the light.
L486645	u7503	m507	CASEY	What kind of game?
L486644	u7510	m507	MAN	Which is it?
L486643	u7503	m507	CASEY	NOOO!
L486642	u7510	m507	MAN	Then he dies. Right now.
L486641	u7503	m507	CASEY	No...
L486640	u7510	m507	MAN	I wanna play a game.
L486639	u7503	m507	CASEY	Why are you doing this?
L486638	u7510	m507	MAN	That all depends on you.
L486637	u7503	m507	CASEY	Please don't hurt him.
L486636	u7510	m507	MAN	Guess.
L486635	u7503	m507	CASEY	Where are you?
L486632	u7510	m507	MAN	Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
L486631	u7503	m507	CASEY	How do you know his name?
L486630	u7510	m507	MAN	His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
L486629	u7503	m507	CASEY	So you better leave.
L486628	u7510	m507	MAN	I believe you...
L486627	u7503	m507	CASEY	I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
L486626	u7510	m507	MAN	I'm getting scared.
L486625	u7503	m507	CASEY	I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
L486624	u7510	m507	MAN	Sure...
L486623	u7503	m507	CASEY	I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
L486622	u7510	m507	MAN	I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
L486621	u7503	m507	CASEY	My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
L486620	u7510	m507	MAN	Or else what?
L486619	u7503	m507	CASEY	Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
L486615	u7510	m507	MAN	TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
L486614	u7503	m507	CASEY	What do you want?
L486613	u7510	m507	MAN	They'd never make it in time.
L486612	u7503	m507	CASEY	I'm two seconds from calling the police.
L486611	u7510	m507	MAN	More of a game, really.
L486610	u7503	m507	CASEY	Is this some kind of a joke?
L486609	u7510	m507	MAN	NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
L486608	u7503	m507	CASEY	Listen, asshole...
L486607	u7503	m507	CASEY	No-bored.
L486606	u7510	m507	MAN	You getting scared?
L486605	u7503	m507	CASEY	Dial someone else, okay?
L486604	u7510	m507	MAN	To talk.
L486603	u7503	m507	CASEY	What do you want?
L486602	u7510	m507	MAN	I told you not to hang up on me.
L486601	u7503	m507	CASEY	Yes?
L486600	u7510	m507	MAN	Don't...
L486599	u7503	m507	CASEY	Gotta go.
L486598	u7510	m507	MAN	Don't hang up on me.
L486597	u7503	m507	CASEY	Nah, I don't think so...
L486596	u7510	m507	MAN	Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
L486595	u7503	m507	CASEY	I have to go now.
L486594	u7510	m507	MAN	What do you think I said?
L486593	u7503	m507	CASEY	That's not what you said.
L486592	u7510	m507	MAN	I want to now who I'm talking to.
L486591	u7503	m507	CASEY	What did you say?
L486590	u7510	m507	MAN	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
L486589	u7503	m507	CASEY	Why do you want to know my name?
L486588	u7510	m507	MAN	You never told me your name.
L486587	u7503	m507	CASEY	No.
L486586	u7510	m507	MAN	Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
L486585	u7503	m507	CASEY	Why? You wanna ask me out?
L486584	u7510	m507	MAN	So, you gotta boyfriend?
L486583	u7503	m507	CASEY	The first one was, but the rest sucked.
L486582	u7510	m507	MAN	Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
L486581	u7503	m507	CASEY	Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
L486580	u7510	m507	MAN	Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
L486579	u7503	m507	CASEY	Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
L486578	u7510	m507	MAN	Guess.
L486577	u7503	m507	CASEY	Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
L486576	u7510	m507	MAN	You have to have a favorite.
L486575	u7503	m507	CASEY	I don't know.
L486574	u7510	m507	MAN	What's your favorite scary movie?
L486573	u7503	m507	CASEY	Uh-huh.
L486572	u7510	m507	MAN	Do you like scary movies?
L486571	u7503	m507	CASEY	Just some scary movie.
L486570	u7510	m507	MAN	Really? What?
L486569	u7503	m507	CASEY	I'm getting ready to watch a video.
L486568	u7510	m507	MAN	I only eat popcorn at the movies.
L486567	u7503	m507	CASEY	Uh-huh.
L486566	u7510	m507	MAN	You're making popcorn?
L486565	u7503	m507	CASEY	Popcorn.
L486564	u7510	m507	MAN	What's that noise?
L486563	u7503	m507	CASEY	I don't think so.
L486562	u7510	m507	MAN	You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
L486561	u7503	m507	CASEY	Who is this?

L486557	u7510	m507	MAN	I want to talk to you for a second.
L486556	u7503	m507	CASEY	What?
L486555	u7510	m507	MAN	Wait, wait, don't hang up.
L486554	u7503	m507	CASEY	You're forgiven. Bye now.
L486553	u7510	m507	MAN	To apologize.
L486552	u7503	m507	CASEY	So why did you dial it again?
L486551	u7510	m507	MAN	I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
L486550	u7503	m507	CASEY	Hello.
L486549	u7503	m507	CASEY	It happens. Take it easy.
L486548	u7510	m507	MAN	Do I?
L486547	u7503	m507	CASEY	I think you have the wrong number.
L486546	u7510	m507	MAN	I don't know.
L486545	u7503	m507	CASEY	What number are you trying to reach?
L486544	u7510	m507	MAN	What number is this?
L486543	u7503	m507	CASEY	Who are you trying to reach?
L486542	u7510	m507	MAN	Who is this?
L486541	u7503	m507	CASEY	Yes.
L487400	u7506	m507	GALE	I'll get my camera.
L487399	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I'll call for backup.
L487395	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
L487394	u7506	m507	GALE	Sidney's father?
L487393	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
L487388	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I don't think you're so bad.
L487387	u7506	m507	GALE	People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
L487386	u7506	m507	GALE	What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
L487385	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
L487384	u7506	m507	GALE	I like it. It's... sexy.
L487383	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
L487382	u7506	m507	GALE	So is Dewey your real name?
L487360	u7504	m507	DEWEY	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
L487359	u7506	m507	GALE	Can I bring Kenny?
L487358	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
L487357	u7506	m507	GALE	I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
L487356	u7504	m507	DEWEY	A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
L487355	u7506	m507	GALE	What kind of lead?
L487354	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
L487259	u7506	m507	GALE	Mind if I join you?
L487258	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
L487257	u7506	m507	GALE	Then what are you doing here?
L487256	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
L487255	u7506	m507	GALE	You never know when or where a story will break.
L487254	u7504	m507	DEWEY	What brings you out to these parts?
L487253	u7506	m507	GALE	Deputy... good evening.
L487252	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Evening, ma'am.
L487124	u7506	m507	GALE	You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
L487123	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
L487121	u7504	m507	DEWEY	That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
L487120	u7506	m507	GALE	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
L487119	u7504	m507	DEWEY	If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
L487118	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We haven't ruled out that possibil...
L487117	u7506	m507	GALE	He's not a suspect, is he?
L487116	u7504	m507	DEWEY	No, not yet.
L487115	u7506	m507	GALE	Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
L487114	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
L487113	u7506	m507	GALE	Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
L487112	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
L487111	u7506	m507	GALE	Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
L487108	u7506	m507	GALE	Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
L487107	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
L487106	u7506	m507	GALE	I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
L487105	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
L487104	u7506	m507	GALE	And why is that? Has something happened?
L487103	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
L487102	u7506	m507	GALE	Productive. So they're closing down the school?
L487101	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
L487100	u7506	m507	GALE	Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
L487274	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
L487273	u7517	m507	TATUM	What is she doing here?
L487242	u7517	m507	TATUM	Shit.
L487241	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
L487240	u7517	m507	TATUM	No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
L487193	u7517	m507	TATUM	Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
L487192	u7504	m507	DEWEY	A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
L486932	u7517	m507	TATUM	I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
L486931	u7504	m507	DEWEY	What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
L486927	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Hold up a sec...
L486926	u7517	m507	TATUM	Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
L486888	u7517	m507	TATUM	Yes, you doofus.
L486887	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Does mom know?
L486884	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
L486883	u7517	m507	TATUM	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
L486882	u7504	m507	DEWEY	What are you doing here?
L487289	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Not yet.
L487288	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Should I be worried?
L487287	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Afraid not.
L487286	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Have they found my father?
L487239	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
L487238	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Yeah.
L487237	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You girls ready.
L487199	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
L487198	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
L487195	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
L487194	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
L486985	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	And my Dad? Any word on him?
L486984	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
L486983	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
L486982	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
L486949	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
L486948	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Any word on my Dad?
L486905	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
L486904	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I don't know. I guess.
L486903	u7504	m507	DEWEY	He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
L486902	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	At the airport.
L486901	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You're sure it was the Hilton?
L486900	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Did you reach my Dad?
L486880	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	...yeah...
L486879	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
L487218	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Yes, sir.
L487217	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
L487216	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
L487215	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
L487214	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
L487213	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
L487212	u7504	m507	DEWEY	You think he could still be in town?
L487211	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
L487210	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Have you contacted the bureau?
L487209	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
L487208	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
L487207	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
L487206	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Keeping my eye on Sidney.
L487205	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
L487099	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Yes, sir, sheriff.
L487098	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
L486929	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We haven't located her Dad yet.
L486928	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	She staying with you?
L486925	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
L486924	u7504	m507	DEWEY	They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
L486923	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	What about the cellular phone bill?
L486922	u7504	m507	DEWEY	That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
L486877	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
L486876	u7504	m507	DEWEY	She's tough.
L486875	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	How is she?
L486874	u7504	m507	DEWEY	Drive by patrol.
L486873	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	What were you doing out here?
L486872	u7504	m507	DEWEY	I was first to respond.
L486870	u7504	m507	DEWEY	He's her boyfriend.
L486869	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
L486868	u7504	m507	DEWEY	We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
L486768	u7514	m507	SHERIFF BURKE	How is everything?
L486767	u7504	m507	DEWEY	It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
L486704	u7511	m507	MOTHER	Not my daughter... not my...
L486703	u7505	m507	FATHER	Casey! Casey!
L486702	u7511	m507	MOTHER	I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
L486701	u7505	m507	FATHER	Where is she?
L486698	u7511	m507	MOTHER	The phone's dead.
L486697	u7505	m507	FATHER	Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
L486696	u7505	m507	FATHER	Call the police.
L486695	u7511	m507	MOTHER	Where is she?
L486694	u7505	m507	FATHER	Casey? Casey?
L486693	u7511	m507	MOTHER	What is it? Where's Casey?
L486692	u7505	m507	FATHER	Jesus...
L486691	u7511	m507	MOTHER	I told you to send it back.
L486690	u7505	m507	FATHER	That fish smelled strong.
L487251	u7506	m507	GALE	As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
L487250	u7509	m507	KENNY	About thirty seconds.
L487249	u7506	m507	GALE	What's the delay?
L487248	u7509	m507	KENNY	The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
L487247	u7506	m507	GALE	Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
L487246	u7509	m507	KENNY	What's the plan?
L487030	u7506	m507	GALE	Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
L487029	u7509	m507	KENNY	But it's so much easier when we make it up.
L487028	u7506	m507	GALE	If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
L487027	u7509	m507	KENNY	When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
L487026	u7506	m507	GALE	No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
L487025	u7509	m507	KENNY	You want to go live?
L487024	u7506	m507	GALE	Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
L486892	u7506	m507	GALE	Jesus! The camera-hurry!
L486891	u7509	m507	KENNY	What? What?
L487015	u7506	m507	GALE	But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
L487014	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I saw him leaving wearing it.
L487013	u7506	m507	GALE	He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
L487012	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
L487011	u7506	m507	GALE	Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
L487010	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Has his story changed?
L487009	u7506	m507	GALE	Many times.
L487008	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Have you talked to Cotton?
L487007	u7506	m507	GALE	I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
L487006	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
L487005	u7506	m507	GALE	He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
L487004	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Do you still think he's innocent?
L487003	u7506	m507	GALE	What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
L487002	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
L487001	u7506	m507	GALE	Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
L487000	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You owe my mother.
L486999	u7506	m507	GALE	I owe you shit.
L486998	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Please. You owe me.
L486997	u7506	m507	GALE	Forget it.
L486996	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Off the record. No cameras.
L486995	u7506	m507	GALE	Kenny. Camera. Now.
L486994	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I want to talk to you.
L486993	u7506	m507	GALE	Just stay back.
L486992	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'm not here to fight.
L486944	u7506	m507	GALE	I'll send you a copy.
L486943	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'll look for it.
L486942	u7506	m507	GALE	It'll be out later this year.
L486941	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	How's the book?
L486940	u7506	m507	GALE	Yes, that's right.
L486939	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
L487085	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Ricki Lake.
L487084	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Where do you get this shit?
L487083	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
L487082	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
L487081	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
L487080	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	You're evil.
L487079	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
L487078	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
L487077	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
L487076	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	And why would she do that?
L487075	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
L487074	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
L487073	u7508	m507	GIRL #2	Why would she lie about it?
L487072	u7507	m507	GIRL #1	She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
L486970	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Who are you?
L486969	u7510	m507	MAN	Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
L486968	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	LEAVEMEALONE!
L486967	u7510	m507	MAN	Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
L486965	u7510	m507	MAN	Hello Sidney.
L486964	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Hello?
L486858	u7510	m507	MAN	If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
L486857	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
L486856	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What am I doing?
L486855	u7510	m507	MAN	Uh-huh.
L486854	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Can you see me right now?
L486853	u7510	m507	MAN	Right here.
L486852	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So where are you?
L486850	u7510	m507	MAN	That's the original part.
L486849	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why would you call me from my front porch?
L486848	u7510	m507	MAN	Your front porch.
L486847	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So where are you?
L486846	u7510	m507	MAN	The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
L486845	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So who are you?
L486844	u7510	m507	MAN	Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
L486843	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
L486842	u7510	m507	MAN	Are you alone in the house?
L486841	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
L486840	u7510	m507	MAN	And why is that?
L486839	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
L486838	u7510	m507	MAN	What's your favorite scary movie?
L486837	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
L486836	u7510	m507	MAN	Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
L486835	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
L486834	u7510	m507	MAN	Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
L486833	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I have no idea.
L486724	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	Sleep tight, sweetie.
L486723	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Have a good trip.
L486721	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Got it.
L486720	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	...so call if you need me.
L486719	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	...out at the airport...
L486718	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
L486717	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No you didn't.
L486716	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	I heard screaming.
L486715	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Can you knock?
L486714	u7512	m507	MR. PRESCOTT	Are you okay?
L486803	u7513	m507	RANDY	Twice.
L486802	u7517	m507	TATUM	I thought Blockbuster fired you.
L486801	u7513	m507	RANDY	Working, thank you.
L486800	u7517	m507	TATUM	Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
L486799	u7513	m507	RANDY	Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
L486798	u7517	m507	TATUM	Stu was with me last night.
L487530	u7513	m507	RANDY	You got it.
L487529	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
L487414	u7513	m507	RANDY	Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
L487413	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Don't come any closer.
L487412	u7513	m507	RANDY	Don't shoot. It's me.
L487411	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Stop. Right there.
L487265	u7513	m507	RANDY	She's the Scream Queen.
L487264	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
L487421	u7513	m507	RANDY	No, Sid.
L487420	u7516	m507	STU	Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
L487419	u7513	m507	RANDY	Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
L487418	u7516	m507	STU	His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
L487352	u7516	m507	STU	I'll be right back.
L487351	u7513	m507	RANDY	Yeah.
L487350	u7516	m507	STU	Wanna another beer?
L487349	u7513	m507	RANDY	"There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say ""I'll be right back."""
L487345	u7513	m507	RANDY	Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
L487344	u7516	m507	STU	I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
L487315	u7516	m507	STU	Like you had one.
L487314	u7513	m507	RANDY	There goes my chance with Sid.
L487313	u7516	m507	STU	He came to make up.
L487312	u7513	m507	RANDY	What's Leatherface doing here?
L487281	u7516	m507	STU	I can cry on cue.
L487280	u7513	m507	RANDY	We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
L487263	u7513	m507	RANDY	I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
L487262	u7516	m507	STU	I thought everything was checked out.
L487191	u7513	m507	RANDY	It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
L487190	u7516	m507	STU	And what would be your motive?
L487189	u7513	m507	RANDY	You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
L487185	u7513	m507	RANDY	So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
L487184	u7516	m507	STU	Which is you...
L487183	u7513	m507	RANDY	Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
L487182	u7516	m507	STU	I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
L487181	u7513	m507	RANDY	Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
L487180	u7516	m507	STU	She's saving herself for you.
L487179	u7513	m507	RANDY	Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
L487178	u7516	m507	STU	So what's his reason?
L487177	u7513	m507	RANDY	There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
L487176	u7516	m507	STU	Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
L487175	u7513	m507	RANDY	Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
L487174	u7516	m507	STU	The why'd the police let him go?
L487173	u7513	m507	RANDY	You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
L487172	u7516	m507	STU	It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
L487171	u7513	m507	RANDY	If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
L487170	u7516	m507	STU	What?
L487169	u7513	m507	RANDY	Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
L487168	u7516	m507	STU	You coming tonight?
L487167	u7513	m507	RANDY	We had a run in the mass murder section.
L487166	u7516	m507	STU	Jesus, this place is packed.
L486808	u7513	m507	RANDY	Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
L486807	u7516	m507	STU	I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
L486806	u7513	m507	RANDY	"Besides --  ""Takes a man to do something like that."""
L486797	u7513	m507	RANDY	It would certainly improve your high school Q.
L486796	u7516	m507	STU	What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
L486795	u7513	m507	RANDY	And are the police aware you dated the victim?
L486792	u7513	m507	RANDY	Before she dumped him for Steve.
L486791	u7516	m507	STU	For about two seconds.
L486781	u7516	m507	STU	Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
L486780	u7513	m507	RANDY	That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
L487516	u7516	m507	STU	Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
L487515	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
L487459	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You'll never get away with this.
L487458	u7516	m507	STU	"The official term is ""psychotic""."
L487457	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You're crazy -- both of you.
L487450	u7516	m507	STU	It's all part of the game.
L487449	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why are you doing this?
L487448	u7516	m507	STU	Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
L487309	u7516	m507	STU	You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
L487308	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
L487139	u7516	m507	STU	Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
L487138	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Yeah, okay... whatever.
L487137	u7516	m507	STU	Remember, there's safety in numbers.
L487133	u7516	m507	STU	My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
L487132	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Are you serious?
L487131	u7516	m507	STU	And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
L487047	u7516	m507	STU	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
L487046	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Why are they doing this?
L486790	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
L486789	u7516	m507	STU	You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
L487236	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Deal.
L487235	u7517	m507	TATUM	There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
L487234	u7517	m507	TATUM	Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
L487233	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	TATUM!
L487232	u7517	m507	TATUM	Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
L487231	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
L487230	u7517	m507	TATUM	"Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, ""Eight is enough..."""
L487229	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No way.
L487228	u7517	m507	TATUM	"During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" It's a real turn on."
L487227	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
L487226	u7517	m507	TATUM	"Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman."
L487225	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Who?
L487224	u7517	m507	TATUM	With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
L487223	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What do you think about when you're having sex?
L487222	u7517	m507	TATUM	Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
L487221	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
L487220	u7517	m507	TATUM	You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
L487219	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
L487202	u7517	m507	TATUM	He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
L487201	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Is Billy going to be there tonight?
L487197	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Oh, god...
L487196	u7517	m507	TATUM	Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
L487155	u7517	m507	TATUM	Come on, let's rock.
L487154	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
L487153	u7517	m507	TATUM	Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
L487152	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
L487151	u7517	m507	TATUM	Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
L487150	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	And you believe it?
L487149	u7517	m507	TATUM	It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
L487148	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
L487147	u7517	m507	TATUM	You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
L487146	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
L487145	u7517	m507	TATUM	I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
L487144	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	So you think my mom was a slut too?
L487143	u7517	m507	TATUM	Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
L487136	u7517	m507	TATUM	Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
L487135	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I don't know...
L487134	u7517	m507	TATUM	This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
L487126	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It was him, Tatum. I know it.
L487125	u7517	m507	TATUM	It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
L487041	u7517	m507	TATUM	Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
L487040	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I bet he's pissed.
L487039	u7517	m507	TATUM	Shit, what is he doing here?
L487038	u7517	m507	TATUM	I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
L487037	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
L487032	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
L487031	u7517	m507	TATUM	Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
L486990	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
L486989	u7517	m507	TATUM	Come on, Sid.
L486962	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's alright. I'll get it.
L486961	u7517	m507	TATUM	Take a message.
L486956	u7517	m507	TATUM	I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
L486955	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	He was there, Tatum.
L486954	u7517	m507	TATUM	Do you really think Billy did it?
L486953	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No, nothing's like it used to be.
L486952	u7517	m507	TATUM	Just like old times, ain't it?
L486951	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
L486886	u7517	m507	TATUM	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
L486885	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
L486828	u7517	m507	TATUM	Bye.
L486827	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Whatever. Just hurry.
L486826	u7517	m507	TATUM	Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
L486825	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	I'm not worried.
L486824	u7517	m507	TATUM	Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
L486823	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	It's past seven.
L486822	u7517	m507	TATUM	Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
L486818	u7517	m507	TATUM	Later.
L486817	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Thanks, Tatum.
L486816	u7517	m507	TATUM	I'll be there by seven. I promise
L486815	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
L486814	u7517	m507	TATUM	Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
L486813	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Tell your mom I said thanks.
L486812	u7517	m507	TATUM	No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
L486811	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
L486783	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	How do you gut someone?
L486782	u7517	m507	TATUM	Or a man's mentality.
L486756	u7517	m507	TATUM	They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
L486755	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	They think it's school-related?
L486754	u7517	m507	TATUM	Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
L486753	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Do they know who did it?
L486752	u7517	m507	TATUM	Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
L486751	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
L486750	u7517	m507	TATUM	And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
L486749	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	No way.
L486748	u7517	m507	TATUM	Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
L486747	u7515	m507	SIDNEY	What happened?
L486746	u7517	m507	TATUM	Do you believe this shit?
L487271	u7516	m507	STU	Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
L487270	u7517	m507	TATUM	What am I? The beer wench?
L487269	u7516	m507	STU	I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
L487267	u7517	m507	TATUM	Tits -- see.
L487266	u7516	m507	STU	With that set of lungs -- she should be.
L487245	u7516	m507	STU	Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
L487244	u7517	m507	TATUM	That's mature.
L487130	u7516	m507	STU	Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
L487129	u7517	m507	TATUM	For once, Stu, drop it.
L487128	u7516	m507	STU	Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
L487044	u7516	m507	STU	Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
L487043	u7517	m507	TATUM	You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
L486794	u7516	m507	STU	I did. He's full of shit.
L486793	u7517	m507	TATUM	I thought you dumped her for me.
L486779	u7517	m507	TATUM	That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
L486778	u7516	m507	STU	Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
L486774	u7516	m507	STU	I don't know, they just did.
L486773	u7517	m507	TATUM	Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
L502638	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.
L502637	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes, Dad.
L502636	u7614	m514	JACK	I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
L502635	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes, Dad.
L502634	u7614	m514	JACK	Are you sure?
L502633	u7608	m514	DANNY	No, Dad.
L502632	u7614	m514	JACK	Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
L502631	u7614	m514	JACK	What do you mean?
L502630	u7608	m514	DANNY	You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
L502629	u7614	m514	JACK	What?
L502628	u7608	m514	DANNY	Dad?
L502627	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
L502626	u7608	m514	DANNY	I guess so.
L502625	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
L502624	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do you like this hotel?
L502623	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes?
L502622	u7608	m514	DANNY	Dad?
L502621	u7614	m514	JACK	I can't.  I have too much to do.
L502620	u7608	m514	DANNY	Then why don't you go to sleep?
L502619	u7614	m514	JACK	No.  I'm just a little tired.
L502618	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do you feel bad?
L502617	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes.
L502616	u7608	m514	DANNY	I am, Dad.  Dad?
L502615	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.  I want you to have a good time.
L502614	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes, Dad.
L502613	u7614	m514	JACK	Are you having a good time?
L502612	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay.
L502611	u7614	m514	JACK	How's it going, Doc?
L502610	u7614	m514	JACK	Come here for a minute, first.
L502609	u7608	m514	DANNY	Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
L502332	u7614	m514	JACK	They had to, in order to survive.
L502331	u7608	m514	DANNY	You mean they ate each other up?
L502330	u7614	m514	JACK	There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
L502329	u7608	m514	DANNY	What was the Donner party?
L502328	u7614	m514	JACK	I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
L502324	u7614	m514	JACK	Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
L502323	u7608	m514	DANNY	I'm hungry.
L502322	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes?
L502321	u7608	m514	DANNY	Dad?
L502507	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
L502506	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
L502505	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	No I ain't.
L502504	u7608	m514	DANNY	You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
L502503	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Room 237?
L502502	u7608	m514	DANNY	What about Room 237?
L502501	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
L502500	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
L502499	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
L502498	u7608	m514	DANNY	Is there something bad here?
L502497	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
L502495	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Try to think what it was.
L502494	u7608	m514	DANNY	Maybe he showed me something.
L502493	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
L502492	u7608	m514	DANNY	I don't know.
L502490	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Do they know he tell you things?
L502489	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes.
L502488	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
L502487	u7608	m514	DANNY	It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
L502486	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	How does he tell you things?
L502485	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes.
L502484	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Is Tony the one that tells you things?
L502483	u7608	m514	DANNY	Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
L502482	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Who's Tony?
L502481	u7608	m514	DANNY	Tony.
L502480	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Who says you ain't supposed to?
L502479	u7608	m514	DANNY	I'm not supposed to.
L502478	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Why don't you want to talk about it?
L502466	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
L502465	u7608	m514	DANNY	Chocolate.
L502455	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502454	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Do you like ice cream, Doc?
L502428	u7608	m514	DANNY	French Fries and Ketchup.
L502427	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
L502426	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502425	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
L503069	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh!
L503068	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy!
L503067	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny!
L503066	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy... Mommy...!
L503065	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny, come here!
L503064	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy...
L503023	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L503022	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
L502832	u7619	m514	WENDY	Are you having a bad dream?
L502831	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.
L502830	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny... what's the matter, hon?
L502829	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.
L502828	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L502827	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny?
L502825	u7608	m514	DANNY	Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L502824	u7619	m514	WENDY	If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
L502608	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay, Mom.
L502607	u7619	m514	WENDY	Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
L502606	u7608	m514	DANNY	I won't, Mom.
L502605	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
L502604	u7608	m514	DANNY	I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
L502603	u7619	m514	WENDY	Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
L502602	u7608	m514	DANNY	I won't make any noise.
L502601	u7619	m514	WENDY	Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
L502600	u7608	m514	DANNY	Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
L502599	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes?
L502598	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mom?
L502540	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502539	u7619	m514	WENDY	I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
L502538	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502537	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's so pretty.
L502536	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502535	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
L502533	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502532	u7619	m514	WENDY	Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
L502531	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay...oh!
L502530	u7619	m514	WENDY	Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
L502528	u7619	m514	WENDY	And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
L502527	u7608	m514	DANNY	All right.
L502526	u7619	m514	WENDY	The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
L502463	u7619	m514	WENDY	Okay.  You behave yourself.
L502462	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502407	u7619	m514	WENDY	Danny, come on over here.
L502406	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah.
L502334	u7608	m514	DANNY	Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
L502333	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack...
L502327	u7619	m514	WENDY	Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
L502326	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay, Mom.
L502325	u7619	m514	WENDY	We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
L502290	u7608	m514	DANNY	Okay.
L502289	u7619	m514	WENDY	We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
L502190	u7619	m514	WENDY	What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
L502189	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah, I guess so.
L502188	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
L502187	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
L502186	u7619	m514	WENDY	Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
L502185	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
L502184	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.
L502288	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Yes, I'd like you to.
L502287	u7608	m514	DANNY	Do I have to?
L502286	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
L502283	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
L502282	u7608	m514	DANNY	To my stomach.
L502281	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Where does he go?
L502280	u7608	m514	DANNY	Because he hides.
L502279	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Why not?
L502278	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502277	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
L502276	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Oh,
L502274	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
L502273	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Is Tony one of your animals?
L502272	u7608	m514	DANNY	Talking to Tony.
L502271	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
L502270	u7608	m514	DANNY	Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
L502269	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
L502268	u7608	m514	DANNY	Yes.
L502267	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
L502266	u7608	m514	DANNY	No.
L502265	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
L502316	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
L502315	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	How did he manage to do that?
L502314	u7619	m514	WENDY	Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
L502313	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	What sort of injury did he have?
L502310	u7619	m514	WENDY	No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
L502309	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
L502308	u7619	m514	WENDY	Tony.
L502307	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
L502306	u7619	m514	WENDY	Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
L502305	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
L502300	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
L502299	u7619	m514	WENDY	But eh what was the matter with him?
L502297	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
L502296	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
L502295	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Thank you.
L502294	u7619	m514	WENDY	Please...
L502293	u7609	m514	DOCTOR	Yes.
L502292	u7619	m514	WENDY	Shall we go into the living room?
L502597	u7610	m514	DOROTHY	Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
L502596	u7613	m514	HERMIE	Sure.
L502595	u7610	m514	DOROTHY	Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
L502594	u7613	m514	HERMIE	It's okay, really.
L502593	u7610	m514	DOROTHY	Well how can I repay you?
L502592	u7613	m514	HERMIE	Oh I wouldn't think of it.
L503004	u7611	m514	GRADY	You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
L503003	u7614	m514	JACK	There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
L503002	u7611	m514	GRADY	I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
L503001	u7614	m514	JACK	For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
L503000	u7611	m514	GRADY	Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
L502999	u7614	m514	JACK	Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
L502996	u7611	m514	GRADY	Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
L502995	u7614	m514	JACK	No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
L502990	u7614	m514	JACK	Grady... oh.
L502989	u7611	m514	GRADY	It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
L502819	u7611	m514	GRADY	Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
L502818	u7614	m514	JACK	She eh... interferes.
L502815	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, he is a very willful boy.
L502814	u7611	m514	GRADY	Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
L502813	u7614	m514	JACK	How?
L502812	u7611	m514	GRADY	A nigger cook.
L502811	u7614	m514	JACK	A nigger!
L502810	u7611	m514	GRADY	A nigger.
L502809	u7614	m514	JACK	Who?
L502808	u7611	m514	GRADY	He is, Mr. Torrance.
L502807	u7614	m514	JACK	No.
L502802	u7611	m514	GRADY	Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
L502801	u7614	m514	JACK	And, er... where are they now?
L502800	u7611	m514	GRADY	Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
L502798	u7611	m514	GRADY	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
L502797	u7614	m514	JACK	Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
L502796	u7611	m514	GRADY	Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
L502795	u7611	m514	GRADY	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
L502794	u7614	m514	JACK	haven't I seen you somewhere before?
L502792	u7611	m514	GRADY	That's right, sir.
L502791	u7614	m514	JACK	Delbert Grady.
L502790	u7611	m514	GRADY	Yes, sir.
L502789	u7614	m514	JACK	Grady?
L502786	u7614	m514	JACK	Fine.
L502785	u7611	m514	GRADY	Won't keep you a moment, sir.
L502778	u7614	m514	JACK	Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
L502777	u7611	m514	GRADY	That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
L502774	u7611	m514	GRADY	Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
L502773	u7614	m514	JACK	Advocaat is it?
L502772	u7611	m514	GRADY	I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
L502847	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
L502846	u7616	m514	RANGER	Good evening.  Forest Service.
L502748	u7616	m514	RANGER	All right, sir.
L502747	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
L502746	u7616	m514	RANGER	I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
L502741	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
L502740	u7616	m514	RANGER	Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
L502739	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
L502738	u7616	m514	RANGER	Good evening.  Forest Service.
L502453	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
L502452	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
L502411	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
L502410	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
L502401	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
L502400	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
L502395	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
L502394	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Sure.
L502393	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
L502461	u7619	m514	WENDY	Sound good to you, Danny?
L502460	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Good.
L502459	u7619	m514	WENDY	No, we don't mind.
L502436	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
L502435	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
L502434	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	I did?
L502433	u7619	m514	WENDY	Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
L502432	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Beg pardon?
L502423	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
L502422	u7619	m514	WENDY	I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
L502421	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
L502418	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
L502417	u7619	m514	WENDY	God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
L502416	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
L502415	u7619	m514	WENDY	I'm a Wendy.
L502414	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
L502399	u7619	m514	WENDY	Nice to meet you.
L502398	u7612	m514	HALLORAN	Glad to meet you, Winifred.
L502210	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, I'm looking for a change.
L502209	u7618	m514	WATSON	Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
L502208	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
L502207	u7618	m514	WATSON	What line of work are you in now?
L502206	u7614	m514	JACK	Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
L502201	u7614	m514	JACK	Pleasure to meet you.
L502200	u7618	m514	WATSON	Pleased to meet you.
L502199	u7614	m514	JACK	Bill, how do you do?
L502766	u7615	m514	LLOYD	It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
L502765	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
L502761	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Your money's no good here.
L502760	u7614	m514	JACK	No charge?
L502755	u7615	m514	LLOYD	What'll it be, sir?
L502754	u7614	m514	JACK	It's good to be back, Lloyd.
L502753	u7615	m514	LLOYD	It's good to see you.
L502752	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Good evening Mr. Torrance.
L502751	u7614	m514	JACK	Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
L502686	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
L502685	u7614	m514	JACK	Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
L502682	u7615	m514	LLOYD	I hope it's nothing serious.
L502681	u7614	m514	JACK	Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
L502680	u7615	m514	LLOYD	How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
L502678	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Thank you for saying so.
L502677	u7614	m514	JACK	Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
L502676	u7614	m514	JACK	That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
L502675	u7615	m514	LLOYD	Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
L502674	u7614	m514	JACK	How's my credit in this joint anyway?
L502668	u7614	m514	JACK	Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
L502667	u7615	m514	LLOYD	What'll it be?
L502980	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy...
L502979	u7619	m514	WENDY	I'm gonna go now.
L502978	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy...
L502977	u7619	m514	WENDY	I'll bring back a doctor.
L502959	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502958	u7619	m514	WENDY	Go away.
L502957	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502956	u7619	m514	WENDY	Go away.
L502955	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy...
L502954	u7619	m514	WENDY	Go away from me.
L502953	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502952	u7619	m514	WENDY	Get down.
L502951	u7614	m514	JACK	Stop swinging the bat.
L502950	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack, stay away from me!
L502949	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502948	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me.
L502947	u7614	m514	JACK	Give me the bat.
L502946	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay... stay away!
L502945	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy give me the bat.
L502944	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stop it!
L502943	u7614	m514	JACK	Put the bat down, Wendy.
L502942	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me.
L502941	u7614	m514	JACK	Stop swinging the bat.
L502940	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!  Please...
L502939	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!
L502938	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm not going to hurt you.
L502937	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!
L502935	u7614	m514	JACK	Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
L502934	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away...!
L502933	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy!
L502932	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me,
L502931	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm not going to hurt you.
L502930	u7619	m514	WENDY	Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
L502926	u7614	m514	JACK	Why?
L502925	u7619	m514	WENDY	I just want to go back to my room.
L502924	u7614	m514	JACK	Why?
L502923	u7619	m514	WENDY	Stay away from me!
L502917	u7614	m514	JACK	Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
L502916	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
L502915	u7614	m514	JACK	Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
L502914	u7614	m514	JACK	Of course you are.
L502913	u7619	m514	WENDY	Of course I am.
L502906	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack...
L502905	u7614	m514	JACK	As soon as possible.
L502903	u7614	m514	JACK	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
L502902	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes...
L502901	u7614	m514	JACK	You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
L502900	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
L502899	u7614	m514	JACK	I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
L502898	u7619	m514	WENDY	I don't know.
L502892	u7614	m514	JACK	You can't remember.
L502891	u7619	m514	WENDY	I can't really remember.
L502890	u7619	m514	WENDY	I...
L502884	u7614	m514	JACK	How do you like it?
L502883	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack!
L502737	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
L502736	u7619	m514	WENDY	Jack...
L502735	u7614	m514	JACK	Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
L502733	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502732	u7614	m514	JACK	You mean just leave the hotel?
L502731	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502730	u7614	m514	JACK	Get him out of here?
L502725	u7614	m514	JACK	I think he did it to himself.
L502724	u7619	m514	WENDY	Somebody did that to him.
L502718	u7614	m514	JACK	Good.
L502717	u7619	m514	WENDY	He's still asleep.
L502716	u7614	m514	JACK	Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
L502715	u7619	m514	WENDY	And you didn't see anything at all?
L502714	u7614	m514	JACK	Yes, I did.
L502713	u7619	m514	WENDY	You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
L502711	u7614	m514	JACK	No, nothing at all.
L502710	u7619	m514	WENDY	Did you find anything?
L502699	u7614	m514	JACK	Which room was it?
L502698	u7619	m514	WENDY	No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
L502648	u7614	m514	JACK	I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
L502647	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
L502646	u7614	m514	JACK	I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
L502563	u7614	m514	JACK	Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
L502562	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502561	u7614	m514	JACK	or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
L502560	u7614	m514	JACK	Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
L502559	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yes.
L502558	u7614	m514	JACK	and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
L502556	u7614	m514	JACK	Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
L502555	u7619	m514	WENDY	Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
L502554	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
L502553	u7619	m514	WENDY	Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
L502552	u7614	m514	JACK	What do you want me to do about it?
L502524	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
L502523	u7614	m514	JACK	I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
L502522	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's really nice up here, isn't it?
L502521	u7614	m514	JACK	Yeah... that's all it is.
L502520	u7619	m514	WENDY	Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
L502519	u7614	m514	JACK	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
L502518	u7619	m514	WENDY	Any ideas yet?
L502517	u7614	m514	JACK	Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
L502516	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
L502515	u7614	m514	JACK	Hmm, nice.
L502514	u7619	m514	WENDY	I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
L502513	u7614	m514	JACK	I know it.
L502512	u7619	m514	WENDY	I guess we've been staying up too late.
L502511	u7614	m514	JACK	Eleven thirty - Jesus!
L502510	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's about eleven thirty.
L502509	u7614	m514	JACK	What time is it?
L502508	u7619	m514	WENDY	Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
L502369	u7619	m514	WENDY	Yeah.
L502368	u7614	m514	JACK	Perfect for a child.
L502355	u7619	m514	WENDY	God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
L502354	u7614	m514	JACK	Sure is.
L502320	u7614	m514	JACK	Uh...huh.
L502319	u7619	m514	WENDY	Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
L502253	u7614	m514	JACK	Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
L502252	u7619	m514	WENDY	Hi, hon.  How's it going?
L502251	u7614	m514	JACK	Hi, babe.
L502374	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, it's very... homely.
L502373	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
L502351	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh...
L502350	u7614	m514	JACK	I'd better collect my family first.
L502347	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
L502346	u7614	m514	JACK	Right there.
L502345	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
L502344	u7614	m514	JACK	No, my son's discovered the games room.
L502343	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
L502342	u7614	m514	JACK	No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
L502341	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
L502247	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
L502246	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
L502245	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, obviously some people can be
L502242	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, that is eh quite a story.
L502241	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	shut in together over long periods of time.
L502240	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
L502236	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, my predecessor in this job
L502235	u7614	m514	JACK	I don't believe they did.
L502234	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
L502233	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm intrigued.
L502232	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
L502230	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Great...
L502229	u7614	m514	JACK	They'll love it.
L502228	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
L502227	u7614	m514	JACK	Not for me.
L502226	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	can of itself be a problem.
L502225	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
L502224	u7614	m514	JACK	five months of peace is just what I want.
L502223	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
L502222	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
L502221	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, that sounds fine to me.
L502220	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
L502219	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well...
L502218	u7614	m514	JACK	Only in a very general way.
L502214	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh, it sure would be
L502213	u7614	m514	JACK	Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
L502212	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
L502178	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Susie.
L502177	u7614	m514	JACK	Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
L502176	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
L502175	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
L502174	u7614	m514	JACK	Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
L502173	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Have any trouble finding us?
L502169	u7614	m514	JACK	Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
L502168	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Very nice to meet you.
L502167	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh, well - come on in Jack.
L502166	u7614	m514	JACK	I'm Jack Torrance.
L502165	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes?
L502164	u7614	m514	JACK	Mr. Ullman?
L502471	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes.
L502470	u7619	m514	WENDY	Just like a ghost ship, huh?
L502469	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
L502468	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
L502467	u7619	m514	WENDY	It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
L502450	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	How're you getting on?
L502449	u7619	m514	WENDY	Hi.
L502448	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Hi.
L502409	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Thank you, Susie.
L502408	u7619	m514	WENDY	Thanks.
L502388	u7619	m514	WENDY	Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
L502387	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
L502386	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh, I'll say.
L502385	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
L502384	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
L502383	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
L502363	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh!
L502362	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
L502361	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	All the best people.
L502360	u7619	m514	WENDY	Royalty?
L502359	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
L502357	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
L502356	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
L502353	u7619	m514	WENDY	Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
L502352	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	This is our Colorado Lounge.
L502349	u7618	m514	WATSON	Fine.
L502348	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
L502338	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
L502337	u7618	m514	WATSON	Eight thirty.
L502336	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	What time does the plane leave?
L502205	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Jack is a schoolteacher.
L502204	u7618	m514	WATSON	Fine.
L502203	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
L502198	u7618	m514	WATSON	How do you do?
L502197	u7617	m514	ULLMAN	Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
L506992	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
L506991	u7620	m515	JANE	The moon's not down yet...
L506981	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
L506980	u7620	m515	JANE	Sure, Uncle Al.
L506979	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Can I tell you kids something?
L506957	u7620	m515	JANE	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
L506956	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
L506940	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Jesus.
L506939	u7620	m515	JANE	Blue. This blue.
L506938	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Lowe's car-?
L506905	u7620	m515	JANE	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
L506904	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
L506903	u7620	m515	JANE	If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
L506888	u7620	m515	JANE	Uncle Al-
L506887	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
L507014	u7620	m515	JANE	You're a real booger, you know it?
L507013	u7621	m515	MARTY	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
L507012	u7620	m515	JANE	Are you all right, Marty?
L507001	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane-
L507000	u7620	m515	JANE	Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
L506964	u7620	m515	JANE	Will you?
L506963	u7621	m515	MARTY	Please, Uncle Al.
L506955	u7621	m515	MARTY	Will you marry me, Jane?
L506954	u7620	m515	JANE	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
L506953	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane... you don't have to do that.
L506859	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane, I have to talk to you.
L506858	u7620	m515	JANE	Went shopping. Why?
L506857	u7621	m515	MARTY	Where's Mom?
L506856	u7620	m515	JANE	Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
L506692	u7620	m515	JANE	Let me help you up.
L506691	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yes. Go away.
L506689	u7621	m515	MARTY	Stop it!
L506688	u7620	m515	JANE	What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
L506687	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
L506621	u7621	m515	MARTY	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
L506620	u7620	m515	JANE	I don't want your money. You're a booger.
L506619	u7621	m515	MARTY	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
L506618	u7620	m515	JANE	What's the money for?
L506616	u7620	m515	JANE	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
L506615	u7621	m515	MARTY	Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
L506611	u7620	m515	JANE	Brady's a booger and so are you!
L506610	u7621	m515	MARTY	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
L506609	u7620	m515	JANE	You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
L506663	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
L506662	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
L506661	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
L506657	u7623	m515	TAMMY	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
L506656	u7621	m515	MARTY	Rats...
L506655	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Rattling. Rustling.
L506654	u7621	m515	MARTY	What kind of noises?
L506653	u7623	m515	TAMMY	I've been hearing noises in there.
L506652	u7621	m515	MARTY	What?
L506651	u7623	m515	TAMMY	There's something else scary.
L506650	u7621	m515	MARTY	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
L506649	u7623	m515	TAMMY	I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
L506645	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... it is his third.
L506644	u7623	m515	TAMMY	For getting a divorce?
L506643	u7621	m515	MARTY	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
L506642	u7623	m515	TAMMY	What's that?
L506641	u7621	m515	MARTY	Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
L506639	u7621	m515	MARTY	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
L506638	u7623	m515	TAMMY	You booger.
L506994	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
L506993	u7621	m515	MARTY	What if I say no?
L506990	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
L506989	u7621	m515	MARTY	But Uncle Al! You said-
L506988	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
L506983	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
L506982	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah? Really?
L506962	u7621	m515	MARTY	Will you do it?
L506961	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
L506960	u7621	m515	MARTY	I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
L506959	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
L506958	u7621	m515	MARTY	No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
L506952	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
L506951	u7621	m515	MARTY	I saw what I saw.
L506950	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You're not going to let it go, are you?
L506949	u7621	m515	MARTY	I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
L506948	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
L506947	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
L506937	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	No.
L506936	u7621	m515	MARTY	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
L506935	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It could have been anything, Marty.
L506934	u7621	m515	MARTY	There! You see!
L506933	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
L506928	u7621	m515	MARTY	I told you!
L506927	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
L506926	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
L506925	u7621	m515	MARTY	I told you!
L506924	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
L506910	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
L506909	u7621	m515	MARTY	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
L506908	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
L506907	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, do you see your suspect?
L506906	u7621	m515	MARTY	I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
L506900	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
L506899	u7621	m515	MARTY	No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
L506898	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You want to know what I think?
L506897	u7621	m515	MARTY	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
L506896	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
L506895	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... was it a prescription?
L506894	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
L506893	u7621	m515	MARTY	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
L506892	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	What the hell does that matter?
L506891	u7621	m515	MARTY	Was it a prescription?
L506890	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
L506889	u7621	m515	MARTY	It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
L506850	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
L506849	u7621	m515	MARTY	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
L506848	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	A tracer. You'll like it.
L506847	u7621	m515	MARTY	What is it?
L506846	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Save this one for last.
L506845	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah... sure.
L506844	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
L506843	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah, I know. It's great!
L506842	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
L506840	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah! What is it?
L506839	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
L506834	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Good.
L506833	u7621	m515	MARTY	Sure.
L506832	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
L506831	u7621	m515	MARTY	I don't get you.
L506830	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
L506829	u7621	m515	MARTY	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
L506828	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
L506827	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
L506826	u7621	m515	MARTY	Do I need one?
L506825	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You got a pilot's license, Marty?
L506822	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
L506821	u7621	m515	MARTY	What?
L506820	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
L506818	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
L506817	u7621	m515	MARTY	She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
L506816	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Your mom's not around, is she?
L506814	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
L506813	u7621	m515	MARTY	Don't call me dear boy.
L506812	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
L506811	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
L506810	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
L506809	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
L506808	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
L506807	u7621	m515	MARTY	It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
L506739	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
L506738	u7621	m515	MARTY	What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
L506737	u7621	m515	MARTY	What if it's some kind of monster?
L506736	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Huh?
L506735	u7621	m515	MARTY	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
L506734	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
L506733	u7621	m515	MARTY	No.
L506732	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
L506731	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah.
L506730	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You all right, Marty?
L506680	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
L506679	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mom-!
L506677	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
L506676	u7621	m515	MARTY	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
L506675	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
L506977	u7622	m515	NAN	I will- be good, kids.
L506976	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
L506975	u7622	m515	NAN	You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
L506974	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	We won't!
L506973	u7622	m515	NAN	And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
L506972	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
L506971	u7622	m515	NAN	Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
L506837	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
L506836	u7622	m515	NAN	So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
L506686	u7622	m515	NAN	Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
L506685	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I come here because Marty needs a friend.
L511748	u7643	m517	BALTUS	He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
L511747	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	How did you hear this?
L511746	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
L511595	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
L511594	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
L511363	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
L511362	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Hail, Constable.  How are you?
L511339	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
L511338	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
L511337	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Who took the meat?
L511285	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
L511284	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Many have.
L511283	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
L511260	u7643	m517	BALTUS	This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
L511259	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If we could speak alone.
L511554	u7644	m517	BROM	I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
L511553	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I hit him square.
L511552	u7644	m517	BROM	You must have missed your mark.
L511551	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
L511550	u7644	m517	BROM	Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
L511447	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Two days... ?  For murder?
L511446	u7644	m517	BROM	They spend two days in chains.
L511345	u7644	m517	BROM	Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
L511344	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
L511343	u7644	m517	BROM	What the hell are you doing?
L511254	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
L511253	u7644	m517	BROM	We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
L511250	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
L511249	u7644	m517	BROM	Certainly not.
L511843	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
L511842	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	What?
L511841	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
L511838	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	What of it?
L511837	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Stains of blood.
L511836	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
L511835	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
L511815	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You will stay at her side?
L511814	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
L511666	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	You need rest.
L511665	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Bring him.
L511664	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	You need to sleep.
L511663	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Bring Young Masbath here.
L511662	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
L511661	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	... Brom Bones...
L511660	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
L511392	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
L511391	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
L511390	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
L511368	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	A diseased monster.
L511367	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He is a behemoth.
L511366	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
L511365	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What are you spying on?
L511364	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	We must be a curious sight to him.
L511354	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
L511353	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	What is that?
L511352	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No bleeding.
L511342	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	To place it inside its coffin.
L511341	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why did you move the body, Doctor?
L511267	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	I was afraid of this.
L511266	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
L511265	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	Excuse me?
L511264	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
L511767	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
L511766	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
L511765	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
L511764	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
L511763	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
L511762	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Wallowing quite literally in blood.
L511761	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	They need guidance.
L511760	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Wallowing in sin and lust...
L511759	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	I am the Lord's voice in this town.
L511758	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
L511757	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
L511756	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
L511755	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
L511754	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
L511449	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Does that look like an animal hanging?
L511448	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
L511382	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
L511381	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Your superiors are two days away!
L511380	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Protest to my superiors if you like.
L511379	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	I will not allow it.  I will not!
L511377	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
L511376	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	It is sacrilege!
L511272	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
L511271	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
L511270	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
L511694	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Well... that might be... helpful.
L511693	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
L511692	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Master Hardenbrook...
L511691	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Damn... damn... damn...
L511688	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	A fine idea.
L511687	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Maybe you should take this.
L511686	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
L511685	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	May we look at them now?
L511684	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Hmm?  See them?
L511683	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
L511681	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
L511680	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
L511679	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Do you have these persons' wills?
L511280	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
L511279	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
L511274	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Pardon me?
L511273	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
L511240	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
L511239	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I shall, gladly.
L511238	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
L511237	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Not for lack of trying.
L511236	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	"These ""methods"" of yours... there has been no practical application."
L511235	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Chosen me?
L511234	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
L511232	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
L511231	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
L511230	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
L511229	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Very few, if any.
L511228	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
L511227	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
L511226	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
L511225	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Have they nothing to fear presently?
L511224	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
L511221	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
L511220	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
L511219	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
L511218	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
L511217	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	He drowned.  Anyone could see.
L511216	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
L511386	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
L511385	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Is that all you say?  Look at her.
L511384	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	The Widow Windsor.
L511374	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
L511373	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
L511372	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
L511371	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
L511370	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
L511426	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	At times I do.
L511425	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
L511424	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Listen to what you say....
L511421	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I know it.
L511420	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
L511419	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
L511418	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
L511334	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Well... so much for common sense.
L511333	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
L511332	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is that you wear?
L511328	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Believe?
L511327	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
L511325	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
L511324	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
L511323	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	And now Jonathan Masbath.
L511322	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
L511269	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The militia?
L511268	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
L511936	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Tired.
L511935	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	How are you?
L511902	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I doubt that's the end.
L511901	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What now?
L511893	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Take the reins.
L511892	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What can we do?
L511883	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I know.  Hold on.
L511882	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Lady Van Tassel...
L511881	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Climb up!
L511825	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
L511824	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
L511823	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	This is farewell.
L511821	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
L511820	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Why... why are you like this?
L511819	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
L511818	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
L511817	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
L511816	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
L511752	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
L511751	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What now?  Where is she?
L511728	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
L511727	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
L511726	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What books?
L511725	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
L511724	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
L511720	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	No.  They are all missing.
L511719	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
L511718	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What was she doing?
L511717	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Lady Van Tassel.
L511716	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I was getting worried.  Who was it?
L511714	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  ""Paasch, James"" ""Pieter, Thomas"" ""Pos, William."""
L511713	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
L511709	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
L511708	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Did your father take a loan?
L511707	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Baltus Van Tassel.
L511706	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
L511705	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What does it mean?
L511704	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
L511703	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	In test... what?
L511702	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
L511701	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
L511700	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
L511697	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Yes.
L511696	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
L511695	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
L511690	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
L511689	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What good is this?
L511672	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
L511671	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
L511670	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
L511669	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	All I saw was their lantern.
L511668	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Man or woman?
L511667	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
L511623	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why this tree?
L511622	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	We should go.
L511621	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
L511616	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Stay back.
L511615	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What is it?
L511602	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
L511601	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
L511600	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	True enough.
L511599	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
L511598	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
L511597	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
L511529	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"Let loose his silent shrieking. Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  ""He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand."" Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives."
L511528	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
L511527	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
L511526	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Should we go back?
L511525	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We should not go much further in this murk.
L511524	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"How could something named ""the tree of the dead"" fail to draw attention?"
L511523	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
L511522	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What happened?
L511521	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We are leaving.
L511497	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
L511496	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I hear nothing.
L511495	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Listen.
L511494	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is it?
L511474	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Witches do not exist.  However...
L511473	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Father said witches live there.
L511472	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
L511471	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
L511470	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Thank you.
L511469	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I have others.  All I need is this.
L511468	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	No, I couldn't...
L511467	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
L511466	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	It's spectacular.
L511465	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
L511464	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What kind of nuts?
L511463	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Are you familiar with magnets?
L511461	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Look again.
L511460	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	The Western Woods.
L511459	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Out there.  What do you see?
L511458	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
L511457	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is it?
L511456	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Up.
L511455	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Where are we going?
L511454	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
L511453	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	How could he?
L511452	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
L511389	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
L511388	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I'm sure I don't know.
L511387	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is the common thread between these victims?
L511361	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I did not ask you to, did I?
L511360	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
L511359	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
L511358	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I manage fine alone.
L511357	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
L511356	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
L511921	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We have no choice.
L511920	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I... I can't do this.
L511919	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
L511917	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
L511916	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Quickly, close it.
L511913	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Keep climbing.  I will follow...
L511912	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Ichabod...
L511906	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	His horse.
L511905	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What was that?
L511904	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He moves too fast.
L511903	u7650	m517	KATRINA	The church.
L511887	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I do not know.  Away.
L511886	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Where are we going?
L511790	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
L511789	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Katrina...
L511788	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
L511787	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
L511786	u7650	m517	KATRINA	If you think I am behind this, say it.
L511785	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What would you have me believe?
L511784	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
L511783	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
L511782	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I have not been able to face him yet.
L511781	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What did he say, Katrina?
L511780	u7650	m517	KATRINA	He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
L511779	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	And, what did he say?
L511778	u7650	m517	KATRINA	When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
L511777	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It was you there?
L511776	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
L511772	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Come with me.
L511771	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What is so urgent?
L511659	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
L511658	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What... what are you doing... ?
L511629	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
L511628	u7650	m517	KATRINA	The skull is gone.
L511627	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
L511620	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
L511619	u7650	m517	KATRINA	My God... what has happened?
L511618	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Just... keep where you are.
L511617	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What are you doing?
L511614	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What did you say?
L511613	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Blood.
L511610	u7650	m517	KATRINA	But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
L511609	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
L511608	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I apologize if I worried you.
L511607	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Katrina.  Why do you follow?
L511606	u7650	m517	KATRINA	It is only me.
L511586	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
L511585	u7650	m517	KATRINA	If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
L511584	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
L511583	u7650	m517	KATRINA	She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
L511582	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
L511581	u7650	m517	KATRINA	No, but... why do you ask that?
L511580	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	She is not your birth mother, is she?
L511579	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What?
L511578	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
L511577	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What has happened?
L511576	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
L511575	u7650	m517	KATRINA	The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
L511574	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What troubles you?
L511573	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
L511493	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
L511492	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
L511491	u7650	m517	KATRINA	But, why?  Tell me why.
L511490	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	To avenge his father, and the others.
L511489	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
L511488	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
L511487	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
L511486	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It was not butchery.
L511485	u7650	m517	KATRINA	And this gives worth to butchery?
L511484	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
L511483	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Must I hear this?
L511482	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
L511481	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What are you on about?
L511480	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
L511479	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
L511478	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
L511477	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Why would you do such a thing?
L511442	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
L511441	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	They have done nothing of the sort.
L511440	u7650	m517	KATRINA	People have put their trust in you.
L511439	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
L511438	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You promised justice.
L511417	u7650	m517	KATRINA	That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
L511416	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
L511415	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I insist that you have it.
L511414	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Thank you.  No.  Here...
L511413	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
L511412	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If you want.  But...
L511411	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
L511410	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
L511409	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
L511408	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You made this, and the drawings?
L511407	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
L511406	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Yes, he does.  May I try?
L511405	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
L511404	u7650	m517	KATRINA	It would be interesting to find out.
L511403	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
L511402	u7650	m517	KATRINA	These scars.  How did you get them?
L511400	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
L511399	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
L511398	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
L511397	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
L511319	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You are funny.
L511318	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
L511317	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
L511316	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There is no such thing as magic.
L511315	u7650	m517	KATRINA	To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
L511314	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Are you so superstitious?
L511313	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
L511311	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
L511310	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
L511309	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was ""no"" at least once."
L511308	u7650	m517	KATRINA	He has proposed to me twice.
L511307	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call ""friend,"" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy."
L511306	u7650	m517	KATRINA	My suitor?
L511305	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
L511304	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
L511303	u7650	m517	KATRINA	It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
L511302	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Small talk.
L511301	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Other people?
L511300	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
L511299	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
L511298	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
L511297	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
L511296	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
L511295	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
L511252	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
L511251	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Forgive me, I didn't know.
L511931	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Yes... yes.  I think I will...
L511930	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Let her go!
L511929	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	You cannot kill what is already dead.
L511742	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What... ?
L511741	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	I know you saw me.
L511740	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is fine.  Now, I must...
L511739	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
L511738	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It appears well.  It has already clotted.
L511736	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Very little.  I must be going...
L511735	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
L511734	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Where?
L511733	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	No.  She has gone out.
L511732	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
L511592	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
L511591	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
L511590	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Use caution.
L511589	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes, actually.
L511588	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Returning to the Western Woods?
L511330	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
L511329	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
L511852	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	Yes.  Here...
L511851	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
L511831	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Turn around.  Now!
L511830	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	What did you say?
L511829	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
L511351	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	I didn't see none.
L511350	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There was not much blood, was there?
L511349	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
L511348	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
L511347	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	I can show exactly.
L511346	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
L511513	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
L511512	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What... what are you doing?
L511511	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
L511510	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Can you help?
L511509	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	Sit.
L511508	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Horseman.  Yes.
L511507	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
L511503	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
L511502	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
L511501	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	In a way, yes.
L511500	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	You are from the Hollow?
L511499	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
L511867	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
L511866	u7650	m517	KATRINA	No one will believe your lies, whore.
L511865	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
L511862	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
L511861	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Father saw you die.
L511860	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	He rides tonight.
L511857	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
L511856	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You... you are alive.
L511657	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Doctor, he is awake.
L511656	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
L511569	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
L511568	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	No.
L511567	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	She has confessed.
L511566	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	No, sir, please... she is innocent...
L511565	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	She is guilty.
L511564	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	She did not do it... please listen...
L511563	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
L511562	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	May I see my mother?
L511561	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	Go home.
L517126	u7698	m520	KABUO	Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
L517125	u7690	m520	CARL	$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
L517124	u7690	m520	CARL	Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
L517123	u7698	m520	KABUO	Oh, yeh?
L517122	u7690	m520	CARL	I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
L517118	u7690	m520	CARL	...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.

L517113	u7690	m520	CARL	Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
L517112	u7698	m520	KABUO	Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
L517111	u7690	m520	CARL	Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
L516851	u7702	m520	NELS	...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
L516850	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
L516849	u7702	m520	NELS	With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
L516846	u7702	m520	NELS	You don't.
L516845	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	I don't know.
L516844	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
L516843	u7702	m520	NELS	Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
L516842	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	None.
L516841	u7702	m520	NELS	No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
L516840	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
L516839	u7702	m520	NELS	You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
L516838	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	That's obvious.
L516837	u7702	m520	NELS	And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
L516836	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
L516835	u7702	m520	NELS	But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
L516834	u7691	m520	DR. WHITMAN	Carl Heine's type.
L516833	u7702	m520	NELS	So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
L516590	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
L516589	u7692	m520	ETTA	That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
L516588	u7696	m520	HOOKS	When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
L516587	u7692	m520	ETTA	Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
L516586	u7696	m520	HOOKS	What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
L516578	u7692	m520	ETTA	Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
L516577	u7696	m520	HOOKS	And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
L516576	u7692	m520	ETTA	In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
L516575	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
L516548	u7692	m520	ETTA	Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
L516547	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Why?  If they could never take title.
L516546	u7692	m520	ETTA	Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
L516545	u7696	m520	HOOKS	But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
L516538	u7692	m520	ETTA	They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
L516537	u7696	m520	HOOKS	So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
L516536	u7692	m520	ETTA	Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
L516602	u7692	m520	ETTA	You done your math right.
L516601	u7702	m520	NELS	It is.
L516600	u7692	m520	ETTA	Is that your third question?
L516599	u7702	m520	NELS	So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
L516598	u7692	m520	ETTA	A thousand.
L516597	u7702	m520	NELS	Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
L516596	u7692	m520	ETTA	Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
L516595	u7702	m520	NELS	Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
L517079	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
L517078	u7702	m520	NELS	Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
L517077	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
L517076	u7702	m520	NELS	Well, what if?
L517075	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
L517074	u7702	m520	NELS	All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
L517073	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
L517072	u7702	m520	NELS	Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
L517071	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
L517070	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
L517069	u7702	m520	NELS	Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
L517068	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
L517067	u7702	m520	NELS	So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
L517066	u7702	m520	NELS	I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
L517065	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
L517064	u7702	m520	NELS	Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
L517063	u7693	m520	GILLANDERS	Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
L517062	u7702	m520	NELS	Now, Mister Gi...
L517059	u7696	m520	HOOKS	I said.  No further questions.
L517058	u7694	m520	HATSUE	You're implying th...
L517057	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Question withdrawn, you may step down.
L517055	u7694	m520	HATSUE	It seems human.  To me.
L517054	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
L517053	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Well, it seems to me...
L517052	u7694	m520	HATSUE	We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
L517051	u7696	m520	HOOKS	So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
L517050	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
L517049	u7696	m520	HOOKS	But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
L517048	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
L517047	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Why not?
L517046	u7694	m520	HATSUE	We discussed that.  And decided not to.
L517043	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
L517042	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
L517041	u7696	m520	HOOKS	And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
L517040	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
L517039	u7696	m520	HOOKS	You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
L517037	u7696	m520	HOOKS	So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
L517036	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Closer to eight.
L517035	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
L517034	u7694	m520	HATSUE	We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
L517032	u7696	m520	HOOKS	So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
L517031	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Happy for him.  And relieved.
L517030	u7696	m520	HOOKS	You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
L517029	u7694	m520	HATSUE	I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
L517197	u7694	m520	HATSUE	It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
L517196	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	I did.  But the jury won't s...
L517195	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Did you write that column?
L516968	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
L516967	u7694	m520	HATSUE	You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
L516960	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.

L516922	u7694	m520	HATSUE	I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.

L516665	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
L516664	u7694	m520	HATSUE	I can just feel my spirits soar.
L516531	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Why?  We're only talking.
L516530	u7694	m520	HATSUE	My mom.  Would be the problem.
L516529	u7694	m520	HATSUE	We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
L516528	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
L516527	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
L516507	u7694	m520	HATSUE	Easy.  Slow is best.
L516506	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
L516505	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
L516504	u7694	m520	HATSUE	He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
L516994	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	...but he found you.

L516986	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
L516985	u7695	m520	HELEN	They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
L516984	u7695	m520	HELEN	You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
L516983	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
L516979	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
L516978	u7695	m520	HELEN	You don't believe in God anymore.
L516874	u7700	m520	MAPLES	Oh, in a heartbeat.
L516873	u7696	m520	HOOKS	And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
L516872	u7700	m520	MAPLES	What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
L516871	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Well, what then, sergeant?
L516860	u7700	m520	MAPLES	More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
L516859	u7696	m520	HOOKS	So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
L516858	u7700	m520	MAPLES	It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
L516857	u7696	m520	HOOKS	And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
L516856	u7700	m520	MAPLES	They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
L516796	u7701	m520	MORAN	Pretty darn clear.
L516795	u7696	m520	HOOKS	And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
L516794	u7701	m520	MORAN	You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
L516793	u7696	m520	HOOKS	So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
L516792	u7701	m520	MORAN	Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
L516791	u7696	m520	HOOKS	And the last...?
L516790	u7701	m520	MORAN	From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
L516789	u7696	m520	HOOKS	And the next one...?

L516427	u7705	m520	WHALEY	Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.

L516425	u7705	m520	WHALEY	I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.

L516384	u7702	m520	NELS	My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
L516383	u7696	m520	HOOKS	Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
L516382	u7702	m520	NELS	As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?

L517223	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
L517222	u7701	m520	MORAN	Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
L517206	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Won't take two.
L517205	u7701	m520	MORAN	You said three minutes.

L517367	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	You ever been strangled by a single hand?
L517366	u7702	m520	NELS	If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
L517364	u7702	m520	NELS	I'll take two.  One for later.
L517363	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Cigarette?
L517312	u7702	m520	NELS	Well, anything coulda caused that.
L517311	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
L517310	u7702	m520	NELS	You think so?
L517309	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	He hit his head.  On the way in.
L517308	u7702	m520	NELS	Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
L517307	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
L517306	u7702	m520	NELS	Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
L517299	u7702	m520	NELS	The knife.  What knife?
L517298	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
L517297	u7702	m520	NELS	But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
L517296	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
L517295	u7702	m520	NELS	Maybe...?
L517294	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
L517293	u7702	m520	NELS	Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
L517292	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
L517291	u7702	m520	NELS	Still lashed to the mast.
L517290	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
L517289	u7702	m520	NELS	Fell.
L517288	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	That's when he fell.
L517281	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
L517280	u7702	m520	NELS	Well, why does it?
L517279	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
L517278	u7702	m520	NELS	Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
L517277	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
L517276	u7702	m520	NELS	Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
L517271	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	To my father.  Everything counts.
L517270	u7702	m520	NELS	He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
L517269	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	Yes, he was.
L517268	u7702	m520	NELS	Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
L517267	u7702	m520	NELS	I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
L517266	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	You're wondering why I held it.
L517265	u7702	m520	NELS	This tastes horrible, hmmn?
L517262	u7702	m520	NELS	No, you don't.
L517261	u7697	m520	ISHMAEL	It's the way it happened, I know it is.
L516819	u7701	m520	MORAN	Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
L516818	u7698	m520	KABUO	Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
L516816	u7698	m520	KABUO	Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
L516815	u7701	m520	MORAN	You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
L516810	u7701	m520	MORAN	Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
L516809	u7698	m520	KABUO	Naw, I had that around for a while.
L516808	u7701	m520	MORAN	See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
L516805	u7698	m520	KABUO	I was checking the cables.
L516804	u7701	m520	MORAN	You always run with the well open?
L516800	u7701	m520	MORAN	We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
L516799	u7698	m520	KABUO	What for, Sheriff?
L517103	u7698	m520	KABUO	And what do you believe?
L517102	u7702	m520	NELS	I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
L517101	u7698	m520	KABUO	You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
L517100	u7702	m520	NELS	I want you.  To tell the truth.
L517099	u7698	m520	KABUO	You want me to say that.
L517096	u7702	m520	NELS	You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
L517095	u7698	m520	KABUO	I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
L517092	u7702	m520	NELS	That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
L517091	u7698	m520	KABUO	And what's that?
L516660	u7698	m520	KABUO	I should show them an American?
L516659	u7702	m520	NELS	So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
L516657	u7698	m520	KABUO	Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
L516656	u7702	m520	NELS	Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...

L516642	u7698	m520	KABUO	You wouldn't even see it move.
L516641	u7698	m520	KABUO	Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
L516640	u7702	m520	NELS	Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
L516638	u7702	m520	NELS	I think you like learning.
L516637	u7698	m520	KABUO	You must think I like losing.
L516635	u7698	m520	KABUO	You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
L516634	u7702	m520	NELS	White or black?
L516632	u7702	m520	NELS	Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
L516631	u7698	m520	KABUO	What makes you think I play?
L516831	u7701	m520	MORAN	<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
L516830	u7702	m520	NELS	Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
L516829	u7701	m520	MORAN	What else could it be?
L516828	u7702	m520	NELS	Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
L516827	u7701	m520	MORAN	One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
L516825	u7701	m520	MORAN	The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
L516824	u7702	m520	NELS	And her farmhouse...?
L516823	u7701	m520	MORAN	She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
L516822	u7702	m520	NELS	How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
L516421	u7701	m520	MORAN	Possible.  But not darn likely.
L516420	u7702	m520	NELS	Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
L516419	u7702	m520	NELS	You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
L516418	u7701	m520	MORAN	He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
L516417	u7702	m520	NELS	You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
L516416	u7701	m520	MORAN	I don't think so.
L516415	u7702	m520	NELS	Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
L516414	u7702	m520	NELS	Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
L516413	u7701	m520	MORAN	I believe so.
L516412	u7702	m520	NELS	I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
L516411	u7701	m520	MORAN	Apparently.
L516410	u7702	m520	NELS	So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
L516409	u7701	m520	MORAN	No.
L516408	u7702	m520	NELS	No spare.
L516407	u7701	m520	MORAN	Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
L516406	u7702	m520	NELS	Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
L516404	u7701	m520	MORAN	It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
L516403	u7702	m520	NELS	But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
L516402	u7701	m520	MORAN	He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
L516401	u7702	m520	NELS	Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
L516400	u7701	m520	MORAN	It is.
L516399	u7702	m520	NELS	You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
L516398	u7702	m520	NELS	You have to wonder.
L516397	u7701	m520	MORAN	A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
L516396	u7702	m520	NELS	Does it now?
L516395	u7701	m520	MORAN	Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
L516394	u7702	m520	NELS	And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
L516393	u7701	m520	MORAN	Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
L516392	u7702	m520	NELS	I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
L516391	u7701	m520	MORAN	Maybe.
L516390	u7702	m520	NELS	Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
L516389	u7701	m520	MORAN	Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
L516464	u7705	m520	WHALEY	<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
L516463	u7702	m520	NELS	Are you absol...
L516462	u7705	m520	WHALEY	Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
L516461	u7702	m520	NELS	Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
L516460	u7705	m520	WHALEY	Can I say something, here?
L516459	u7705	m520	WHALEY	For the third time, yes.
L516458	u7702	m520	NELS	But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
L516457	u7705	m520	WHALEY	For certain, no.
L516456	u7702	m520	NELS	<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
L516455	u7705	m520	WHALEY	I already said that, b...
L516454	u7702	m520	NELS	Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
L516453	u7705	m520	WHALEY	Sure, anything's poss...
L516452	u7702	m520	NELS	Is it possible?
L516451	u7705	m520	WHALEY	If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
L516450	u7702	m520	NELS	So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
L516449	u7705	m520	WHALEY	The same.
L516448	u7702	m520	NELS	Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
L516447	u7705	m520	WHALEY	Obviously.
L516446	u7702	m520	NELS	In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
L516444	u7702	m520	NELS	Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
L516443	u7705	m520	WHALEY	Well...
L516442	u7702	m520	NELS	Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
L516441	u7705	m520	WHALEY	That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
L516439	u7705	m520	WHALEY	As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
L516438	u7702	m520	NELS	So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
L516907	u7704	m520	SUSAN MARIE	That's all he said.
L516906	u7702	m520	NELS	The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
L516905	u7704	m520	SUSAN MARIE	Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
L516904	u7702	m520	NELS	Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
L516902	u7702	m520	NELS	You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
L516901	u7704	m520	SUSAN MARIE	I can't speak for him.
L516900	u7702	m520	NELS	Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
L516899	u7704	m520	SUSAN MARIE	He had no reason to.
L516898	u7702	m520	NELS	Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
L516897	u7702	m520	NELS	Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
L516896	u7704	m520	SUSAN MARIE	Carl never lied.
L516895	u7702	m520	NELS	I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
L516893	u7702	m520	NELS	So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
L516892	u7704	m520	SUSAN MARIE	Not in those words.
L516891	u7702	m520	NELS	Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
L516890	u7704	m520	SUSAN MARIE	I wouldn't say encouraged.
L516889	u7702	m520	NELS	So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
L526896	u7805	m528	BARNES	Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
L526895	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Open it, Captain!
L526894	u7805	m528	BARNES	... Your civil rights have been overridden!
L526892	u7805	m528	BARNES	Please, Dr. Levine.
L526891	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
L526890	u7805	m528	BARNES	Calm down, Dr. Levine.
L526889	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
L527286	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	I can't...
L527285	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher!  Now!
L527284	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	I can't see...
L527283	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get out of there!
L527282	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	It's burning...
L527281	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher, get away from there...
L527277	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher, I want you back here.
L527276	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
L527273	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
L527272	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
L527585	u7805	m528	BARNES	Pull it, damn it!
L527584	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman, please!  Don't!
L527583	u7805	m528	BARNES	Now!
L527582	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't do it!
L527580	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman, don't do it!
L527579	u7805	m528	BARNES	Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
L527578	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
L527575	u7805	m528	BARNES	Do you see it?
L527574	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't do it, Norman!
L527564	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's either that or we grow gills.
L527563	u7806	m528	BETH	That's our reserve air.
L527562	u7805	m528	BARNES	Increase positive pressure!
L527559	u7805	m528	BARNES	He's right beneath us.
L527558	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?
L527557	u7805	m528	BARNES	Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
L527556	u7806	m528	BETH	Where is it?
L527552	u7806	m528	BETH	What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
L527551	u7805	m528	BARNES	Thirty yards.
L527550	u7805	m528	BARNES	Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
L527549	u7806	m528	BETH	But you've tested it?
L527548	u7805	m528	BARNES	Forty yards.
L527547	u7805	m528	BARNES	It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
L527546	u7806	m528	BETH	High Voltage?
L527545	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
L527544	u7806	m528	BETH	What do we use for defense?
L527543	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fifty yards and closing.
L527542	u7806	m528	BETH	What if it attacks?
L527541	u7805	m528	BARNES	A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
L527537	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?
L527536	u7805	m528	BARNES	Direction's east coming!
L527530	u7805	m528	BARNES	Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
L527529	u7806	m528	BETH	Nice work, Captain sir.
L527491	u7805	m528	BARNES	You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
L527490	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
L527289	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody move!
L527288	u7806	m528	BETH	But she's --
L527287	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody move.
L527249	u7806	m528	BETH	Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
L527248	u7805	m528	BARNES	There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
L527247	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah.  I heard you.
L527246	u7805	m528	BARNES	Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
L527224	u7806	m528	BETH	Two and a half days?
L527223	u7805	m528	BARNES	They told me about sixty hours.
L527222	u7806	m528	BETH	How long will that be?
L527221	u7805	m528	BARNES	The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
L527198	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
L527197	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman!
L527191	u7805	m528	BARNES	What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
L527190	u7806	m528	BETH	I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
L527110	u7805	m528	BARNES	Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
L527109	u7806	m528	BETH	Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
L527007	u7806	m528	BETH	How about I just press the button?
L527006	u7805	m528	BARNES	Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
L526999	u7806	m528	BETH	Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
L526998	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it?
L526997	u7806	m528	BETH	Hold on --
L526988	u7806	m528	BETH	Would you wait a minute?
L526987	u7805	m528	BARNES	I said back away.
L526986	u7806	m528	BETH	Wait a minute --
L526985	u7805	m528	BARNES	Back away then.
L526984	u7806	m528	BETH	There's heat coming the door.
L526854	u7805	m528	BARNES	Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
L526853	u7806	m528	BETH	In basic English, what does all this mean?
L526845	u7805	m528	BARNES	Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
L526844	u7806	m528	BETH	How big is this spacecraft?
L527577	u7805	m528	BARNES	Pull it.
L527576	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I see it.
L527571	u7805	m528	BARNES	You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
L527570	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes, sir.  I'm here.
L527555	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
L527554	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
L527553	u7805	m528	BARNES	What the hell?  It shut us down.
L527539	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Jerry?
L527538	u7805	m528	BARNES	Going active.
L527527	u7805	m528	BARNES	No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
L527526	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
L527525	u7805	m528	BARNES	Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
L527524	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
L527523	u7805	m528	BARNES	You think he killed Edmunds?
L527520	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
L527519	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't want you talking to Jerry.
L527488	u7811	m528	NORMAN	At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
L527487	u7805	m528	BARNES	If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
L527486	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What for?
L527454	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?  Can you copy?
L527453	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
L527452	u7805	m528	BARNES	Damn it, Edmunds?
L527451	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
L527450	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?
L527422	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
L527421	u7805	m528	BARNES	You don't think weapons are important?
L527420	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
L527419	u7805	m528	BARNES	Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
L527379	u7805	m528	BARNES	What am I -- a dog, now?
L527378	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
L527377	u7805	m528	BARNES	"He translated it wrong.  ""My name is Jerry""?  It's like ""See Spot run."""
L527338	u7805	m528	BARNES	"-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, ""When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."""
L527337	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- I didn't know it would come to this --
L527336	u7805	m528	BARNES	-- and then brought her down here --
L527335	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a second --
L527334	u7805	m528	BARNES	You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
L527333	u7811	m528	NORMAN	At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
L527332	u7805	m528	BARNES	So you knew this when you wrote your report?
L527331	u7811	m528	NORMAN	'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
L527330	u7805	m528	BARNES	When was this?
L527329	u7811	m528	NORMAN	She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
L527328	u7805	m528	BARNES	She should've known better.
L527327	u7811	m528	NORMAN	A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
L527326	u7805	m528	BARNES	I think I do.
L527325	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You don't want to know.
L527324	u7805	m528	BARNES	How drastic?
L527323	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
L527182	u7805	m528	BARNES	"No ""buts"".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit."
L527181	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir --
L527180	u7805	m528	BARNES	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
L527179	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
L527161	u7805	m528	BARNES	He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
L527160	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
L527159	u7805	m528	BARNES	What do you mean, he's missing?
L527158	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry's missing.
L527152	u7805	m528	BARNES	Just worry about yourself.
L527151	u7811	m528	NORMAN	All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
L527150	u7805	m528	BARNES	Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
L527149	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
L527148	u7805	m528	BARNES	Don't get hysterical, Norman.
L527108	u7805	m528	BARNES	Everything can be killed.
L527107	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.  That's the point.
L527106	u7805	m528	BARNES	You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
L527105	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
L527104	u7805	m528	BARNES	"Like ""Thou shall not kill""?"
L527095	u7811	m528	NORMAN	If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
L527094	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527093	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Maybe we shouldn't.
L527076	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't know.  But it's something alien.
L527075	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Picked up something?  What is it?
L526977	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Take a look.
L526976	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it, Norman?
L526921	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
L526920	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What's wrong with oxygen?
L526919	u7805	m528	BARNES	They pressurize us with helium.
L526843	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
L526842	u7805	m528	BARNES	Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
L526841	u7811	m528	NORMAN	ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
L526840	u7805	m528	BARNES	The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
L526839	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What team?
L526838	u7805	m528	BARNES	We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
L526837	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It doesn't make any sense.
L526836	u7805	m528	BARNES	Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
L526835	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
L526834	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's impossible.
L526833	u7805	m528	BARNES	Extraordinary, isn't it?
L526832	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
L526831	u7805	m528	BARNES	Maybe older --
L526830	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on --
L526829	u7805	m528	BARNES	-- dating the crash at least that old.
L526828	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- Wait a second --
L526827	u7805	m528	BARNES	Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
L526826	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Geologists?
L526825	u7805	m528	BARNES	See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
L526823	u7805	m528	BARNES	As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
L526822	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
L526821	u7805	m528	BARNES	Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
L526820	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
L526817	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you need me for?
L526816	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L526815	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then why am I here?
L526814	u7805	m528	BARNES	Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
L526813	u7811	m528	NORMAN	A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
L526812	u7805	m528	BARNES	A thousand feet.
L526811	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How deep is he?
L526809	u7811	m528	NORMAN	They didn't tell me anything.
L526808	u7805	m528	BARNES	A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
L526807	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Storm?  What storm?
L526806	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're moving fast considering the storm.
L526805	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
L526804	u7811	m528	NORMAN	From what?  What's with all the security?
L526803	u7805	m528	BARNES	Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
L526802	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Press?  No, I haven't.
L526801	u7805	m528	BARNES	You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
L526798	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Nothing else.
L526797	u7805	m528	BARNES	Anything else?
L526796	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
L526795	u7805	m528	BARNES	What have you been told so far?
L526794	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What team?
L526793	u7805	m528	BARNES	Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
L526792	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
L526791	u7805	m528	BARNES	Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
L526790	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
L526789	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Captain.  Right, forgive me.
L526788	u7805	m528	BARNES	Captain.
L526787	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thank you, Colonel.
L527381	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	In a minute, sir.
L527380	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
L527212	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
L527211	u7805	m528	BARNES	Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
L527207	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
L527206	u7805	m528	BARNES	They've left, keep watching!
L527205	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
L527201	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	In the ship, sir.
L527200	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, where the fuck is he?
L527199	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Yes, sir.
L527193	u7805	m528	BARNES	What the hell is going on here?
L527192	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing, sir.
L527187	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
L527186	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing, sir.
L527185	u7805	m528	BARNES	Any sign of Harry?
L527184	u7805	m528	BARNES	They're coming.
L527183	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
L527178	u7805	m528	BARNES	Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
L527177	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Subs are still at surface, sir.
L527173	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Harry?  Can you copy?
L527172	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
L527143	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
L527142	u7805	m528	BARNES	What caused it?
L526936	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
L526935	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
L526934	u7805	m528	BARNES	Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
L526933	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	It's not sucking, sir.
L526929	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Working on it now, sir.
L526928	u7805	m528	BARNES	Can you open that panel?
L527443	u7809	m528	HARRY	If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
L527442	u7805	m528	BARNES	She wired this system.
L527441	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's not gonna know.
L527440	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
L527416	u7809	m528	HARRY	What -- you want me to retype it?
L527415	u7805	m528	BARNES	"With an ""o"".  Harold with an ""o""."
L527414	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm in charge.
L527413	u7809	m528	HARRY	"He's saying, ""Take me to your leader."" He wants to know who's in charge."
L527412	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527408	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's not gonna know, sir.
L527407	u7805	m528	BARNES	Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
L527400	u7809	m528	HARRY	He understands me fine.
L527399	u7805	m528	BARNES	Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
L527397	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's not ignorant.
L527396	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
L527375	u7805	m528	BARNES	How do you mean, strange?
L527374	u7809	m528	HARRY	I have to tell you.  It's strange.
L527373	u7805	m528	BARNES	What's the message?
L527372	u7809	m528	HARRY	"... spiralling out of the center, you see: ""G"" is one, ""B"" is two, ""H"" is three, and so on... when I got the message."
L527341	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
L527340	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
L527169	u7809	m528	HARRY	Please watch your closest monitor...
L527168	u7805	m528	BARNES	Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
L527167	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ladies and Gentlemen...
L527166	u7805	m528	BARNES	Gimme a report, I want --
L527117	u7805	m528	BARNES	Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
L527116	u7809	m528	HARRY	Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
L527115	u7805	m528	BARNES	You don't know that.
L527114	u7809	m528	HARRY	It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
L527113	u7805	m528	BARNES	Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
L527101	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
L527100	u7805	m528	BARNES	So?  What's the problem?
L527097	u7805	m528	BARNES	The what?
L527096	u7809	m528	HARRY	Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
L527092	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ted seems to have some ideas.
L527091	u7805	m528	BARNES	So how do we get it open?
L527089	u7805	m528	BARNES	A break for what?
L527088	u7809	m528	HARRY	To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
L527087	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527086	u7809	m528	HARRY	No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
L527074	u7805	m528	BARNES	So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
L527073	u7809	m528	HARRY	We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
L527072	u7805	m528	BARNES	Yes, Harry.
L527071	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ted?  Captain?
L526983	u7809	m528	HARRY	Then how can it be chipped?
L526982	u7805	m528	BARNES	I did.
L526981	u7809	m528	HARRY	I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
L526980	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
L526979	u7809	m528	HARRY	Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
L526978	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's chipped.
L526851	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
L526850	u7809	m528	HARRY	Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
L526849	u7805	m528	BARNES	To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
L526848	u7809	m528	HARRY	How much damage?
L527485	u7805	m528	BARNES	"In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the ""delay"" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes."
L527484	u7814	m528	TED	What sub?
L527483	u7805	m528	BARNES	Resetting the sub.
L527482	u7814	m528	TED	What was Edmunds doing outside?
L527481	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
L527467	u7814	m528	TED	Too big?
L527466	u7805	m528	BARNES	It won't register.  It's too big to image.
L527465	u7814	m528	TED	What?
L527464	u7805	m528	BARNES	The sensors are picking up something outside.
L527463	u7814	m528	TED	What is that?
L527447	u7814	m528	TED	Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
L527446	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?
L527392	u7814	m528	TED	Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
L527391	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's not talking, it's mimicking.
L527384	u7805	m528	BARNES	I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
L527383	u7814	m528	TED	Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
L527382	u7805	m528	BARNES	I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
L527349	u7814	m528	TED	What's inside the sphere.
L527348	u7805	m528	BARNES	From the sphere?
L527275	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
L527274	u7814	m528	TED	She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
L527219	u7805	m528	BARNES	Internal power.
L527218	u7814	m528	TED	To what?
L527217	u7805	m528	BARNES	They switched us over.
L527164	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
L527163	u7814	m528	TED	Sir, about leaving --
L527162	u7805	m528	BARNES	How can he be missing?
L527157	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
L527156	u7814	m528	TED	Did you hear me, sir, because --
L527154	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?  No, I know they're civilians...
L527153	u7814	m528	TED	Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
L527083	u7814	m528	TED	Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
L527082	u7805	m528	BARNES	But what does it do?  This... sphere.
L527052	u7814	m528	TED	Maybe we didn't want to come back.
L527051	u7805	m528	BARNES	What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
L527050	u7814	m528	TED	Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
L527041	u7814	m528	TED	Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
L527040	u7805	m528	BARNES	We had considered it.
L527013	u7805	m528	BARNES	What do you make of this?
L527012	u7814	m528	TED	What's wrong?
L526996	u7814	m528	TED	A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
L526995	u7805	m528	BARNES	Radiation shield, you think?
L526994	u7814	m528	TED	Some sort of lead or something.
L526993	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it?
L526992	u7814	m528	TED	Look at this.
L526990	u7814	m528	TED	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
L526989	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, get her away from the door.
L526939	u7814	m528	TED	What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
L526938	u7805	m528	BARNES	What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
L526932	u7805	m528	BARNES	Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
L526931	u7814	m528	TED	I'd also like it noted --
L526927	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
L526926	u7814	m528	TED	Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
L526847	u7805	m528	BARNES	The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
L526846	u7814	m528	TED	A half a mile long?
L528072	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
L528071	u7806	m528	BETH	How's that?
L528070	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
L528069	u7806	m528	BETH	Would it work?
L527993	u7806	m528	BETH	Get away --
L527992	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527991	u7806	m528	BETH	Get away from me!
L527990	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hear what?
L527989	u7806	m528	BETH	You hear that?
L527988	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L527987	u7806	m528	BETH	What is that?  What are you doing?
L527983	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
L527982	u7806	m528	BETH	Top shelf, is it?
L527981	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon --
L527980	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
L527979	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth -- gimme the gun.
L527978	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
L527977	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I --
L527976	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
L527975	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
L527974	u7806	m528	BETH	You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
L527972	u7806	m528	BETH	Leave me alone, Norman.
L527971	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth?
L527957	u7806	m528	BETH	It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
L527956	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Stop it!
L527954	u7806	m528	BETH	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
L527953	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then where's it coming from?
L527952	u7806	m528	BETH	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
L527951	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, stop it!
L527950	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't you know?
L527949	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where is it coming from, Beth?
L527948	u7806	m528	BETH	You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
L527947	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth!
L527945	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
L527944	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't fuck with me, Beth.
L527943	u7806	m528	BETH	Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
L527938	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get away from the door, Beth.
L527937	u7806	m528	BETH	This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
L527932	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
L527931	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not safe for you to be either.
L527930	u7806	m528	BETH	It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
L527928	u7806	m528	BETH	It's either this... or I kill you.
L527927	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't, Beth.  Please.
L527926	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
L527925	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527924	u7806	m528	BETH	Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
L527923	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I promise --
L527922	u7806	m528	BETH	But I have to, Norman.
L527921	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't, Beth.
L527920	u7806	m528	BETH	It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything. Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
L527919	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
L527918	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
L527917	u7806	m528	BETH	"When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  ""I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water."" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?"
L527916	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up, Beth --
L527915	u7806	m528	BETH	"No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  ""Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming."" ""But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared."" ""C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun.""  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?"
L527914	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Beth, the message said Harry.  ""My name is Harry"".  My name isn't Harry."
L527913	u7806	m528	BETH	Is it?
L527912	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's bullshit.
L527911	u7806	m528	BETH	"You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  ""Like everything's on the tip of my tongue"", he said."
L527910	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes.
L527909	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
L527908	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I never went in that sphere.
L527907	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
L527906	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're insane.
L527905	u7806	m528	BETH	Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
L527904	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You manifested that, Beth.
L527903	u7806	m528	BETH	One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
L527902	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's when you went in the sphere.
L527901	u7806	m528	BETH	And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
L527900	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But --
L527899	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
L527898	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're lying --
L527897	u7806	m528	BETH	C'mon -- what?
L527896	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
L527895	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
L527894	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Someone did.
L527893	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I manifested the snakes?
L527892	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
L527891	u7806	m528	BETH	No, he can't.
L527890	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He can't manifest.
L527889	u7806	m528	BETH	No, he isn't.
L527888	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
L527887	u7806	m528	BETH	Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
L527886	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
L527885	u7806	m528	BETH	"What's the phrase -- ""keeping up with the Joneses""?"
L527884	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Did you?
L527883	u7806	m528	BETH	If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
L527882	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Are you manifesting them?
L527881	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't you?
L527880	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Do you fear them?
L527879	u7806	m528	BETH	You tell me.
L527878	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
L527877	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
L527876	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You know what I mean.
L527875	u7806	m528	BETH	Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
L527874	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How do you feel about snakes?
L527873	u7806	m528	BETH	I did do that, didn't I?
L527872	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
L527871	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't think I put something in it, do you?
L527870	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You think I'd really drink that?
L527869	u7806	m528	BETH	It's getting cold.
L527868	u7806	m528	BETH	Are you?
L527867	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm feeling better.
L527866	u7806	m528	BETH	What's wrong, Norman?
L527862	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
L527861	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Your watch.
L527860	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
L527840	u7806	m528	BETH	How's Harry?
L527839	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
L527838	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you mean, different?
L527837	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The sphere looks different.
L527836	u7806	m528	BETH	In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
L527835	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where are you?
L527834	u7806	m528	BETH	What is it, Norman?
L527829	u7806	m528	BETH	You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
L527828	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not believing you.
L527827	u7806	m528	BETH	For what?
L527826	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm sorry.
L527815	u7806	m528	BETH	Only lab rats.  Here.
L527814	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
L527813	u7806	m528	BETH	You ever given an injection before.
L527812	u7806	m528	BETH	Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
L527811	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You want to kill him?
L527810	u7806	m528	BETH	To be on the safe side.  I mean --
L527809	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527808	u7806	m528	BETH	It's an idea.
L527806	u7806	m528	BETH	What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
L527805	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Doesn't say.
L527804	u7806	m528	BETH	How fast does it take effect?
L527803	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
L527802	u7806	m528	BETH	I'll just boost the doses.
L527801	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Three to six hours.
L527800	u7806	m528	BETH	How long does it last?
L527799	u7811	m528	NORMAN	20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... 
L527797	u7806	m528	BETH	... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... 
L527796	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's like a sleeping pill?
L527795	u7806	m528	BETH	Causes sleep.
L527794	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What's that?
L527793	u7806	m528	BETH	It's a soporific.
L527792	u7811	m528	NORMAN	P-a-r-a-s-o...
L527791	u7806	m528	BETH	How do you spell it?
L527790	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Parasolutrine?
L527789	u7806	m528	BETH	Antibiotic.
L527788	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
L527787	u7806	m528	BETH	Antihistamine.  For bites.
L527786	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Riordan?
L527785	u7806	m528	BETH	... and may also cause bizarre halucinations.
L527784	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Bingo.
L527783	u7806	m528	BETH	Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
L527782	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Tarazine?
L527781	u7806	m528	BETH	Nothing about drowsiness.
L527780	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
L527779	u7806	m528	BETH	A synthetic opium analogue.
L527778	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Sintag.
L527777	u7806	m528	BETH	Ulcers.
L527776	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Valdomet.
L527775	u7806	m528	BETH	It's for motion sickness.
L527774	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Ephedrine hydrochloride.
L527773	u7806	m528	BETH	Something for burns.
L527772	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Diphenyl parlene.
L527744	u7806	m528	BETH	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
L527743	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Looks like some sort of code.
L527742	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
L527741	u7806	m528	BETH	And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
L527740	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
L527739	u7806	m528	BETH	His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
L527738	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
L527737	u7806	m528	BETH	But why is he doing it?
L527736	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
L527735	u7806	m528	BETH	Which I told Barnes was attacking --
L527734	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
L527733	u7806	m528	BETH	How can the sphere do that?
L527732	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.
L527731	u7806	m528	BETH	But how?
L527730	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
L527729	u7806	m528	BETH	You think, in the sphere --
L527728	u7811	m528	NORMAN	When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
L527727	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you mean, a part of Harry?
L527726	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say ""Harry"", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry."
L527724	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527723	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He translated it wrong.
L527722	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, ""Stop calling me Jerry"".  And --"
L527721	u7806	m528	BETH	Manifested?
L527720	u7811	m528	NORMAN	After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
L527717	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster.
L527716	u7806	m528	BETH	Squids?
L527715	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
L527714	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87.  I could never read that far."""
L527713	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527712	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87.
L527709	u7806	m528	BETH	Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
L527708	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
L527707	u7806	m528	BETH	You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
L527706	u7811	m528	NORMAN	This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
L527705	u7806	m528	BETH	Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
L527704	u7811	m528	NORMAN	All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
L527703	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't believe me.
L527702	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You think?
L527701	u7806	m528	BETH	No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
L527700	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
L527699	u7806	m528	BETH	None of this was here before.
L527698	u7811	m528	NORMAN	1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
L527697	u7806	m528	BETH	Wait a second --
L527696	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We must've had it delivered then.
L527695	u7806	m528	BETH	That wasn't in there before.
L527694	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
L527693	u7806	m528	BETH	The refridgerator.
L527692	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The refridgerator.
L527691	u7806	m528	BETH	Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
L527690	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Fixing it.
L527689	u7806	m528	BETH	What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
L527688	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I think so, Beth.  Yes.
L527687	u7806	m528	BETH	You get it straightened out?
L527676	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He what?
L527675	u7806	m528	BETH	Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
L527674	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
L527673	u7806	m528	BETH	Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
L527672	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
L527671	u7806	m528	BETH	... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
L527649	u7806	m528	BETH	Still clear.
L527648	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Still clear?
L527647	u7806	m528	BETH	You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
L527646	u7811	m528	NORMAN	My air isn't... I'm coming back.
L527645	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
L527644	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You fixed this suit?  Beth?
L527643	u7806	m528	BETH	What's the matter?
L527642	u7806	m528	BETH	Still clear.
L527641	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
L527640	u7806	m528	BETH	The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
L527637	u7806	m528	BETH	You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
L527636	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But I don't know how --
L527635	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't trust me?
L527634	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You fixed my suit?
L527633	u7806	m528	BETH	I fixed your suit.
L527632	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I would.  But my suit --
L527631	u7806	m528	BETH	I don't trust Harry to do it.
L527630	u7811	m528	NORMAN	In case you die, too?
L527629	u7806	m528	BETH	You should know how it works.  Just in case.
L527628	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Why should I go?
L527627	u7806	m528	BETH	Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
L527626	u7806	m528	BETH	Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
L527625	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Four days?
L527624	u7806	m528	BETH	We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
L527623	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
L527622	u7806	m528	BETH	You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
L527621	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You, me and Harry?
L527620	u7806	m528	BETH	It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
L527619	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not worth the risk.
L527618	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't bother me, Norman.
L527617	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Forget the sub.
L527616	u7806	m528	BETH	I have to reset the sub.
L527615	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where are you going in such a hurry?
L527517	u7806	m528	BETH	No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
L527516	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527515	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
L527514	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
L527513	u7806	m528	BETH	You bastard.
L527512	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't do this.
L527511	u7806	m528	BETH	You did, didn't you?
L527510	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527509	u7806	m528	BETH	You told him about me?
L527508	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L527507	u7806	m528	BETH	You said something to him, didn't you?
L527506	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
L527505	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't tell me to calm down!
L527504	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
L527503	u7806	m528	BETH	He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
L527502	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You went through Edmunds' things?
L527501	u7806	m528	BETH	In Edmunds' things.
L527500	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where did you get this?
L527499	u7806	m528	BETH	Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN.
L527498	u7806	m528	BETH	Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
L527497	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
L527496	u7806	m528	BETH	So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
L527495	u7811	m528	NORMAN	So what?
L527494	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
L527493	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
L527492	u7806	m528	BETH	... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
L527470	u7806	m528	BETH	Eggs.
L527469	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are they?
L527468	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman.
L527462	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What could have done this?
L527461	u7806	m528	BETH	She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
L527460	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
L527320	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth.
L527319	u7806	m528	BETH	I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
L527318	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527317	u7806	m528	BETH	Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
L527316	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth.
L527315	u7806	m528	BETH	What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
L527314	u7811	m528	NORMAN	They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
L527313	u7806	m528	BETH	I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
L527312	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527311	u7806	m528	BETH	What?  Why...
L527310	u7811	m528	NORMAN	And you didn't tell anyone?
L527309	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, why?
L527308	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
L527307	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527306	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a minute.
L527305	u7806	m528	BETH	They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
L527304	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you mean -- not normal?
L527303	u7806	m528	BETH	Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
L527302	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
L527301	u7806	m528	BETH	What about you?  What happened to you?
L527300	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah, it was awful.
L527299	u7806	m528	BETH	My gosh, Norman.
L527298	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
L527297	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
L527296	u7806	m528	BETH	A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
L527295	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We have a library?
L527294	u7806	m528	BETH	The library.
L527293	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where'd this come from?
L527119	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
L527118	u7806	m528	BETH	It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
L527058	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get this thing off me.
L527057	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman!
L527028	u7806	m528	BETH	Good theory, Ted.
L527027	u7811	m528	NORMAN	400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
L526957	u7806	m528	BETH	Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
L526956	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
L526955	u7806	m528	BETH	You're next, Norman.
L526954	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah.  Drowning.
L526953	u7806	m528	BETH	Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
L526876	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What -- are you threatening me?
L526875	u7806	m528	BETH	Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
L526874	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The timing has never seemed quite right.
L526873	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
L526872	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It never occurred to me.
L526871	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
L526870	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
L526869	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
L526868	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Underwater?
L526867	u7806	m528	BETH	To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
L526866	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait -- down where?
L526865	u7806	m528	BETH	Because when we get down there --
L526864	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
L526863	u7806	m528	BETH	Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
L526862	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
L526861	u7806	m528	BETH	That's quite a secret.
L526860	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
L526859	u7806	m528	BETH	I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
L526858	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
L526857	u7806	m528	BETH	I love secrets.
L526856	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
L527406	u7806	m528	BETH	Who says it's a he?
L527405	u7814	m528	TED	He doesn't wait for an answer.
L527195	u7814	m528	TED	By the bunks.
L527194	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman?  Where's Norman?
L527030	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
L527029	u7814	m528	TED	Well, what's your theory?
L527018	u7814	m528	TED	It doesn't make any sense.
L527017	u7806	m528	BETH	I don't get it.
L527002	u7814	m528	TED	Well, they're not mine.
L527001	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
L527000	u7814	m528	TED	No.  I don't think so.
L526900	u7806	m528	BETH	What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
L526899	u7814	m528	TED	Pussy.
L528063	u7809	m528	HARRY	Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
L528062	u7806	m528	BETH	We can refuse to talk.
L528061	u7809	m528	HARRY	They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
L527766	u7809	m528	HARRY	Yes you are...
L527765	u7806	m528	BETH	No I'm not.  I'm not star--
L527764	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're staring at me.
L527763	u7806	m528	BETH	Like what?  I'm not --
L527762	u7809	m528	HARRY	Why are you looking at me like that?
L527761	u7809	m528	HARRY	Another attack?
L527760	u7806	m528	BETH	Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
L527759	u7809	m528	HARRY	Just in time for what?
L527758	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527757	u7809	m528	HARRY	In time for what?
L527756	u7806	m528	BETH	Just in time, too.
L527749	u7809	m528	HARRY	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
L527748	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
L527747	u7809	m528	HARRY	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
L527746	u7806	m528	BETH	Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
L527681	u7806	m528	BETH	Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
L527680	u7809	m528	HARRY	We never even had a conversation, Norman.
L527679	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
L527678	u7809	m528	HARRY	I never said that.
L527677	u7806	m528	BETH	When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
L527103	u7809	m528	HARRY	Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
L527102	u7806	m528	BETH	Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
L527054	u7809	m528	HARRY	A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
L527053	u7806	m528	BETH	What are you looking for?
L527037	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's an American spacecraft.
L527036	u7806	m528	BETH	Then what is it?
L527005	u7809	m528	HARRY	You'd have to ask them.
L527004	u7806	m528	BETH	It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
L526943	u7806	m528	BETH	For whoever's in that thing.
L526942	u7809	m528	HARRY	For who?  The fish?
L526941	u7806	m528	BETH	All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
L526940	u7809	m528	HARRY	Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
L527263	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
L527262	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Is it coming from our own computer?
L527261	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
L527260	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where's it coming from?
L527259	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
L527258	u7811	m528	NORMAN	When did it come across?
L528068	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
L528067	u7809	m528	HARRY	You mean forget?
L528066	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
L528065	u7809	m528	HARRY	We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
L528064	u7811	m528	NORMAN	There is one possibility.
L528055	u7809	m528	HARRY	No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
L528054	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
L528053	u7809	m528	HARRY	How's that working out, by the way?
L528049	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
L528048	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Nine hundred feet to surface.
L528047	u7809	m528	HARRY	Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
L528043	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait!
L528042	u7809	m528	HARRY	Well, press something!
L528041	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No idea.
L528040	u7809	m528	HARRY	You know how to work this thing?
L528038	u7809	m528	HARRY	I'm trying.  There.
L528037	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
L528036	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You got her?
L528035	u7809	m528	HARRY	Her legs are in the way.
L528034	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
L528033	u7809	m528	HARRY	Gimme a second --
L528032	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm trying to keep balance with --
L528031	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon, Norman!
L528024	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up and catch.
L528023	u7809	m528	HARRY	Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
L528022	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I heard!  I heard!
L528021	u7809	m528	HARRY	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
L528020	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on.
L528018	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
L528017	u7809	m528	HARRY	Missed.
L528016	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
L528015	u7809	m528	HARRY	Push her, c'mon.
L528014	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on.
L528013	u7809	m528	HARRY	I can't reach her.
L528007	u7809	m528	HARRY	How far away's the sub?
L528006	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
L528005	u7809	m528	HARRY	How much time you figure to get to the surface?
L528004	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up and open the door.
L528003	u7809	m528	HARRY	We're never gonna make it.
L528002	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Help me lift her.
L528001	u7809	m528	HARRY	Fine.
L527996	u7809	m528	HARRY	I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
L527995	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't think so.
L527994	u7809	m528	HARRY	Did I kill her?
L527823	u7809	m528	HARRY	Stop what?  What are you -- ?
L527822	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's the squid!  Stop it!
L527821	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You know what it is, Harry.
L527820	u7809	m528	HARRY	What is it?
L527771	u7809	m528	HARRY	Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
L527770	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's right.
L527769	u7809	m528	HARRY	The three of us.
L527768	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
L527754	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
L527753	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How do we decode it?
L527752	u7809	m528	HARRY	Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
L527751	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wisconsin?
L527750	u7809	m528	HARRY	Wisconsin's your answer.
L527686	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
L527685	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But why would she -- ?
L527684	u7809	m528	HARRY	I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
L527683	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You didn't say that about the food?
L527682	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's cracking, Norman.
L527670	u7809	m528	HARRY	I thought she was with you.
L527669	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth left?
L527668	u7809	m528	HARRY	Her suit's gone.
L527667	u7811	m528	NORMAN	She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
L527666	u7809	m528	HARRY	When I woke up, nobody was here.
L527665	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you mean?  She's not here?
L527664	u7809	m528	HARRY	What happened to her?
L527663	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
L527661	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're clear.  You see the airlock?
L527660	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
L527659	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman, where are you?
L527658	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry?
L527657	u7809	m528	HARRY	... you there?  Norman?
L527271	u7809	m528	HARRY	I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
L527270	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You don't remember that?
L527269	u7809	m528	HARRY	Did I?
L527268	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
L527267	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
L527266	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
L527265	u7809	m528	HARRY	There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
L527264	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Getting anywhere with those?
L527255	u7809	m528	HARRY	What are they?
L527254	u7811	m528	NORMAN	These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
L527243	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That far in what, Harry?
L527242	u7809	m528	HARRY	I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
L527241	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87 of what, Harry?
L527240	u7809	m528	HARRY	What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
L527239	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What is it, Harry?
L527238	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman?
L527237	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then explain it to me.
L527236	u7809	m528	HARRY	You don't understand about the sphere.
L527235	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
L527234	u7809	m528	HARRY	You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
L527233	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You remember opening the door?
L527232	u7809	m528	HARRY	What are you still doing here?
L527231	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
L527230	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's like...
L527229	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What noise?
L527228	u7809	m528	HARRY	What is that?  That noise?
L527141	u7809	m528	HARRY	Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
L527140	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
L527139	u7809	m528	HARRY	Then what, Norman?
L527138	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  I didn't say that.
L527137	u7809	m528	HARRY	You mean, you think I'm cracking?
L527136	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
L527135	u7809	m528	HARRY	Am I?
L527134	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
L527133	u7809	m528	HARRY	Gimme another explanation.
L527132	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't believe that, Harry.
L527131	u7809	m528	HARRY	Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
L527130	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
L527129	u7809	m528	HARRY	So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
L527128	u7811	m528	NORMAN	So what?
L527127	u7809	m528	HARRY	"On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an ""Unknown Entry Event."" They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible."
L527126	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't follow you.
L527125	u7809	m528	HARRY	A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
L527124	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not a clue.
L527123	u7809	m528	HARRY	I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
L527122	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
L527112	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
L527111	u7809	m528	HARRY	And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
L527099	u7809	m528	HARRY	Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
L527098	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
L527081	u7809	m528	HARRY	Our present.
L527080	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
L527079	u7809	m528	HARRY	This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
L527078	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Which one?  Let me get the list out.
L527077	u7809	m528	HARRY	This answers one of our questions.
L527070	u7809	m528	HARRY	Time travel.  A black hole.
L527069	u7811	m528	NORMAN	To what?
L527068	u7809	m528	HARRY	Our answer.
L527061	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Whatever I can do to help.
L527060	u7809	m528	HARRY	Nice work, Norman.
L526964	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Look, would you --
L526963	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon, Norman.
L526961	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a second, I --
L526960	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon.
L526959	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, why don't --
L526958	u7809	m528	HARRY	Go ahead.  Ladies first.
L526910	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm fine.
L526909	u7809	m528	HARRY	You sound defensive.
L526908	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not being defensive.
L526907	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't be defensive.
L526906	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Fine.  I'm fine.
L526905	u7809	m528	HARRY	You holding up alright?
L526904	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L526903	u7809	m528	HARRY	How are you feeling, Norman?
L527445	u7809	m528	HARRY	"It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming ""witchcraft"".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics."
L527444	u7814	m528	TED	Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
L527394	u7814	m528	TED	Thank you.
L527393	u7809	m528	HARRY	Good idea, Ted.
L527388	u7809	m528	HARRY	We are friends.
L527387	u7814	m528	TED	What'd you say?
L527370	u7809	m528	HARRY	Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
L527369	u7814	m528	TED	See?  No code.  What'd I say?
L527368	u7809	m528	HARRY	... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
L527351	u7814	m528	TED	Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
L527350	u7809	m528	HARRY	If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
L527347	u7814	m528	TED	It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
L527346	u7809	m528	HARRY	Well, if it's a discharge --
L527253	u7814	m528	TED	Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
L527252	u7809	m528	HARRY	Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
L527251	u7814	m528	TED	Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
L527085	u7809	m528	HARRY	Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
L527084	u7814	m528	TED	Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
L527049	u7809	m528	HARRY	Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
L527048	u7814	m528	TED	Arrived?  From where?
L527047	u7809	m528	HARRY	It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
L527046	u7814	m528	TED	Please.  It must have flown here --
L527045	u7809	m528	HARRY	Meaning it didn't land in the water.
L527044	u7814	m528	TED	Meaning?
L527043	u7809	m528	HARRY	We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
L527039	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
L527038	u7814	m528	TED	An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
L527035	u7809	m528	HARRY	Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
L527034	u7814	m528	TED	If it is an alien spacecraft --
L527033	u7809	m528	HARRY	Do you?
L527032	u7814	m528	TED	Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
L527031	u7809	m528	HARRY	All the facts you need are right in front of you.
L527026	u7814	m528	TED	Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
L527025	u7809	m528	HARRY	Think about it.
L527024	u7814	m528	TED	Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
L527023	u7809	m528	HARRY	Is it?
L527022	u7814	m528	TED	But it's impossible.
L527021	u7809	m528	HARRY	A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
L527020	u7814	m528	TED	Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
L527019	u7809	m528	HARRY	You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
L527016	u7809	m528	HARRY	That's right.
L527015	u7814	m528	TED	English?
L526971	u7809	m528	HARRY	Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
L526970	u7814	m528	TED	Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
L526968	u7814	m528	TED	Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
L526967	u7809	m528	HARRY	Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
L526952	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
L526951	u7814	m528	TED	It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
L526917	u7809	m528	HARRY	Just one of Norman's many secrets.
L526916	u7814	m528	TED	What is it, Harry?
L526915	u7809	m528	HARRY	She told me what you said, Norman.
L526914	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
L526913	u7814	m528	TED	What does Norman already know?
L526912	u7809	m528	HARRY	To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
L526911	u7814	m528	TED	What'd you say to him?
L527608	u7811	m528	NORMAN	About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
L527607	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	What was that, sir?
L527606	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
L527605	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
L527604	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth and Harry?
L527603	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	The others, sir?
L527602	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How are the others?
L527601	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
L527600	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The ships?
L527599	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
L527598	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Does this mean what I think it means?
L527597	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	Norman Johnson.
L526783	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Told me what?
L526782	u7812	m528	OFFICER	You mean they haven't told you yet?
L526781	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526780	u7812	m528	OFFICER	By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
L526779	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Really?
L526778	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
L526777	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Captain who?
L526776	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
L526775	u7812	m528	OFFICER	This way, sir.
L526774	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, they didn't say --
L526773	u7812	m528	OFFICER	No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
L526772	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
L526771	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
L526770	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
L526769	u7813	m528	PILOT	Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
L526768	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Geologists?  At a plane crash?
L526767	u7813	m528	PILOT	Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
L526766	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Who's everyone?
L526765	u7813	m528	PILOT	Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
L526764	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Know what?
L526763	u7813	m528	PILOT	You mean you don't know?
L526762	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526761	u7813	m528	PILOT	Huh?
L526760	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526759	u7813	m528	PILOT	Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
L526758	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You've heard of me?
L526757	u7813	m528	PILOT	Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
L526756	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
L527522	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
L527521	u7814	m528	TED	Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
L527479	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not sure.
L527478	u7814	m528	TED	You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
L527475	u7814	m528	TED	Not that I know of.  Why?
L527474	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
L527473	u7814	m528	TED	Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
L527472	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What was it?
L527449	u7814	m528	TED	Why's that?
L527448	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
L527424	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"When he uses a phrase like ""I am Happy"", I think we should think twice about what we ask him."
L527423	u7814	m528	TED	You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
L527402	u7814	m528	TED	Unless it's an act.
L527401	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, he's polite.
L527367	u7814	m528	TED	"Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that ""someone went to a lot of trouble, try again"" bullshit.  And ""impotent"".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick."
L527366	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
L527365	u7814	m528	TED	Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
L527364	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The creature?
L527363	u7814	m528	TED	Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
L527362	u7811	m528	NORMAN	This is like nursery school.
L527361	u7814	m528	TED	Try this one.
L527360	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Please, Ted.
L527359	u7814	m528	TED	Squint harder.
L527358	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't see anything.
L527357	u7814	m528	TED	Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
L527356	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You mean a picture?
L527355	u7814	m528	TED	It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
L527354	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Like what?
L527353	u7814	m528	TED	He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
L527011	u7814	m528	TED	Still, make a note I recognized that.
L527010	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
L527009	u7814	m528	TED	Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
L526973	u7814	m528	TED	You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
L526972	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You want me to try?
L526902	u7814	m528	TED	He's a pussy.
L526901	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He wasn't feeling well.
L526754	u7815	m528	WIFE	They never used to send a Navy car.
L526753	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.
L526752	u7815	m528	WIFE	Was it a military crash?
L526751	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L526750	u7815	m528	WIFE	There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
L526749	u7815	m528	WIFE	How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
L526748	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
L526747	u7815	m528	WIFE	Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
L526746	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Four.  Four years --
L526745	u7815	m528	WIFE	Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
L526744	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't be so supportive, honey.
L526743	u7815	m528	WIFE	In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
L526742	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
L526741	u7815	m528	WIFE	There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
L526740	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You seen my suitcase?
L526739	u7815	m528	WIFE	What kind of a crash was it?
L545227	u7849	m531	KIRK	We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
L545226	u7845	m531	ILIA	<U>Answer</U>!
L545225	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our data is being prepared.
L545155	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
L545154	u7849	m531	KIRK	Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
L545152	u7849	m531	KIRK	The information will not be disclosed.
L545151	u7845	m531	ILIA	They have repressed the Creator.
L545150	u7849	m531	KIRK	Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
L545149	u7845	m531	ILIA	Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
L545138	u7845	m531	ILIA	KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
L545137	u7849	m531	KIRK	Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
L545136	u7845	m531	ILIA	Disclose the information.
L545124	u7845	m531	ILIA	You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
L545123	u7849	m531	KIRK	The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
L545122	u7845	m531	ILIA	The Creator has not answered.
L545121	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Why</U>?!
L545120	u7845	m531	ILIA	The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
L545119	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Why</U>...?!
L544968	u7845	m531	ILIA	You may proceede.
L544967	u7849	m531	KIRK	The examination is a normal function.
L544963	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
L544962	u7849	m531	KIRK	Who is V'ger?
L544961	u7845	m531	ILIA	The Creator is that which created V'ger.
L544957	u7845	m531	ILIA	To join with him.
L544956	u7849	m531	KIRK	Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
L544955	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
L544954	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
L544952	u7845	m531	ILIA	That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
L544951	u7849	m531	KIRK	Where is Lt. Ilia?
L544949	u7849	m531	KIRK	Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
L544948	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger is that which programmed me.
L544947	u7849	m531	KIRK	Who is...'V'ger'...?
L545236	u7845	m531	ILIA	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
L545235	u7847	m531	DECKER	And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
L545108	u7847	m531	DECKER	It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
L545107	u7845	m531	ILIA	'To learn all that is learnable.'
L545106	u7847	m531	DECKER	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
L545105	u7845	m531	ILIA	As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
L545093	u7845	m531	ILIA	To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
L545092	u7847	m531	DECKER	To join, and become One with the Creator?
L545091	u7845	m531	ILIA	By the Creator.
L545090	u7847	m531	DECKER	A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
L545038	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is how V'ger will survive.
L545037	u7847	m531	DECKER	You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
L545035	u7845	m531	ILIA	The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
L545034	u7847	m531	DECKER	Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
L545012	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is logical. You may procede.
L545011	u7847	m531	DECKER	Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
L545010	u7845	m531	ILIA	When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
L545009	u7847	m531	DECKER	What does that mean?
L545008	u7845	m531	ILIA	More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
L545007	u7847	m531	DECKER	Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
L545006	u7845	m531	ILIA	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
L545005	u7847	m531	DECKER	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
L545004	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
L545003	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes.
L545002	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
L545001	u7847	m531	DECKER	The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
L545203	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
L545202	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
L545170	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering...
L545169	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
L545168	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
L545017	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
L545016	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
L544944	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
L544943	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
L544763	u7849	m531	KIRK	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
L544762	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
L544682	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Departure angle.
L544681	u7849	m531	KIRK	Departure angle on viewer.
L545253	u7849	m531	KIRK	Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
L545252	u7847	m531	DECKER	And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
L545251	u7849	m531	KIRK	Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
L545250	u7847	m531	DECKER	The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
L545221	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain... I'd like to go along...
L545220	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
L545209	u7849	m531	KIRK	No!
L545208	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
L545207	u7849	m531	KIRK	    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
L545167	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
L545166	u7849	m531	KIRK	Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
L545163	u7849	m531	KIRK	The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
L545162	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, what's the next move?
L544923	u7849	m531	KIRK	They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
L544922	u7847	m531	DECKER	Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
L544909	u7849	m531	KIRK	Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
L544908	u7847	m531	DECKER	The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
L544901	u7849	m531	KIRK	It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
L544900	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's taken control of the computer...!
L544899	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Computer off</U>!
L544868	u7847	m531	DECKER	You asked my opinion, sir.
L544867	u7849	m531	KIRK	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
L544866	u7847	m531	DECKER	That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
L544865	u7849	m531	KIRK	That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
L544864	u7847	m531	DECKER	I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
L544819	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr Decker....
L544818	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
L544815	u7849	m531	KIRK	No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
L544814	u7847	m531	DECKER	Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
L544774	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
L544773	u7847	m531	DECKER	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
L544772	u7849	m531	KIRK	If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
L544748	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes, sir, I'll do that.
L544747	u7849	m531	KIRK	I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
L544746	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
L544745	u7849	m531	KIRK	Granted.
L544744	u7847	m531	DECKER	Permission to speak freely, sir?
L544743	u7849	m531	KIRK	Stop competing with me, Decker!
L544742	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm aware of that, sir.
L544741	u7849	m531	KIRK	You saved the ship.
L544740	u7847	m531	DECKER	Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
L544739	u7849	m531	KIRK	Then you acted properly, of course.
L544738	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
L544737	u7849	m531	KIRK	Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
L544692	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
L544691	u7847	m531	DECKER	... but I still recommend further simulation study.
L544690	u7847	m531	DECKER	Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
L544689	u7849	m531	KIRK	Programming ready?
L544618	u7849	m531	KIRK	You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
L544617	u7847	m531	DECKER	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
L544616	u7849	m531	KIRK	We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
L544599	u7847	m531	DECKER	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
L544598	u7849	m531	KIRK	That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
L544596	u7847	m531	DECKER	Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
L544595	u7849	m531	KIRK	My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
L544594	u7847	m531	DECKER	May I ask Why?
L544593	u7849	m531	KIRK	Yes.
L544592	u7847	m531	DECKER	-- You, personally, are assuming command?
L544591	u7849	m531	KIRK	You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
L544590	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
L544589	u7847	m531	DECKER	You are what...?
L544588	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
L545255	u7847	m531	DECKER	You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
L545254	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
L545217	u7847	m531	DECKER	   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
L545216	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
L545193	u7853	m531	SPOCK	V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
L545192	u7847	m531	DECKER	Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
L545161	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A tractor beam...
L545160	u7847	m531	DECKER	Forward motion, Captain...!
L545126	u7847	m531	DECKER	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
L545125	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
L544980	u7847	m531	DECKER	That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
L544979	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
L544975	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
L544974	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
L544973	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
L544903	u7853	m531	SPOCK	This served the purpose.
L544902	u7847	m531	DECKER	We could have cut it off at the main computer...
L544858	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
L544857	u7847	m531	DECKER	They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
L544754	u7848	m531	ILIA	No.
L544753	u7847	m531	DECKER	If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
L544752	u7848	m531	ILIA	That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
L544751	u7847	m531	DECKER	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
L544750	u7848	m531	ILIA	Was he difficult?
L544712	u7847	m531	DECKER	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
L544711	u7848	m531	ILIA	Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
L544709	u7848	m531	ILIA	Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
L544708	u7847	m531	DECKER	Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
L544656	u7848	m531	ILIA	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
L544655	u7847	m531	DECKER	I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
L544642	u7848	m531	ILIA	Decker....!
L544641	u7847	m531	DECKER	Hello, Ilia.
L544870	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer, standard ahead.
L544869	u7848	m531	ILIA	Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
L544861	u7849	m531	KIRK	Opinion, Mister. Spock?
L544860	u7848	m531	ILIA	Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
L544846	u7848	m531	ILIA	Ten seconds....
L544845	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
L544844	u7848	m531	ILIA	Impact in fifteen seconds...
L544843	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Spock?
L544824	u7849	m531	KIRK	I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
L544823	u7848	m531	ILIA	Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
L544715	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
L544714	u7848	m531	ILIA	Twelve seconds...!
L544713	u7849	m531	KIRK	Time to impact...?
L544648	u7848	m531	ILIA	My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
L544647	u7849	m531	KIRK	And in you, too, Lieutenant.
L544645	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our Exec and Science Officer...
L544644	u7848	m531	ILIA	'Commander' Decker?
L544640	u7849	m531	KIRK	Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
L544639	u7848	m531	ILIA	Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
L545142	u7849	m531	KIRK	That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
L545141	u7854	m531	SULU	Clear the bridge, Captain...?
L544936	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station keeping...
L544935	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station...!
L544932	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters ahead, one third.
L544931	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
L544930	u7854	m531	SULU	Viewer ahead, sir.
L544929	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer ahead.
L544890	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold relative position here...
L544889	u7854	m531	SULU	One hundred kilometers...
L544888	u7849	m531	KIRK	Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
L544887	u7854	m531	SULU	We're already two settings below that, sir.
L544886	u7849	m531	KIRK	Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
L544872	u7854	m531	SULU	Aye, sir.
L544871	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
L544700	u7854	m531	SULU	Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
L544699	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
L544676	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
L544675	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station.
L544674	u7854	m531	SULU	Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
L544673	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
L544575	u7854	m531	SULU	He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
L544574	u7849	m531	KIRK	I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
L544608	u7849	m531	KIRK	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
L544607	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're losing the pattern...!
L544562	u7849	m531	KIRK	Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
L544561	u7850	m531	SCOTT	The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
L544558	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
L544557	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
L544556	u7849	m531	KIRK	See that it is.  Take me over, please.
L544555	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
L544554	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
L544553	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
L545260	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
L545259	u7849	m531	KIRK	... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
L545258	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
L545257	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
L545238	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
L545237	u7849	m531	KIRK	There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
L545224	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
L545223	u7849	m531	KIRK	V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
L545206	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
L545205	u7849	m531	KIRK	The point... 
L545204	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
L545191	u7849	m531	KIRK	There is no alternative.
L545190	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
L545187	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
L545186	u7849	m531	KIRK	Not for us?
L545158	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Precisely.
L545157	u7849	m531	KIRK	The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
L545131	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
L545130	u7849	m531	KIRK	Child...!?
L545113	u7849	m531	KIRK	High mag, Mr. Sulu!
L545112	u7853	m531	SPOCK	These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
L545078	u7853	m531	SPOCK	'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
L545077	u7849	m531	KIRK	What answers?
L545076	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
L545075	u7849	m531	KIRK	What should you have known?
L545069	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
L545068	u7849	m531	KIRK	Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
L545059	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
L545058	u7849	m531	KIRK	If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
L545057	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
L545056	u7849	m531	KIRK	Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
L545054	u7853	m531	SPOCK	New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
L545053	u7849	m531	KIRK	And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
L545052	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
L545050	u7849	m531	KIRK	Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
L545049	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am seeking answers, Captain.
L545048	u7849	m531	KIRK	Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
L544988	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
L544987	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock? Concerned about his chances?
L544978	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
L544977	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
L544976	u7849	m531	KIRK	They had a pattern to follow...
L544940	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
L544939	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
L544915	u7849	m531	KIRK	Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
L544914	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
L544911	u7849	m531	KIRK	Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
L544910	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
L544881	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
L544880	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
L544874	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
L544873	u7849	m531	KIRK	No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
L544863	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... ?
L544862	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Recommend we proceede, Captain.
L544856	u7849	m531	KIRK	But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
L544855	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
L544854	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our... 'insignificance'?
L544853	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
L544850	u7849	m531	KIRK	Any reply from them?
L544849	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
L544827	u7849	m531	KIRK	Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
L544826	u7853	m531	SPOCK	They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
L544821	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
L544820	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
L544810	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
L544809	u7849	m531	KIRK	Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
L544801	u7849	m531	KIRK	I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
L544800	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
L544799	u7849	m531	KIRK	Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
L544798	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
L544797	u7849	m531	KIRK	And whatever you sensed out here....
L544796	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I still contain fragments of my human half.
L544793	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
L544792	u7849	m531	KIRK	Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
L544791	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
L544790	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
L544789	u7849	m531	KIRK	I want him here.  Sit down!
L544788	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
L544787	u7849	m531	KIRK	Sit down, please.
L544786	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Reporting as ordered, Captain.
L544552	u7849	m531	KIRK	I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
L544551	u7852	m531	SONAK	To you, sir?
L544550	u7849	m531	KIRK	Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
L544549	u7852	m531	SONAK	Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
L544548	u7849	m531	KIRK	Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
L544547	u7852	m531	SONAK	Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
L544546	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't you on board?
L544545	u7852	m531	SONAK	Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
L544544	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
L545201	u7849	m531	KIRK	Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
L545200	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	We're ready, sir.
L545199	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
L544732	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
L544731	u7849	m531	KIRK	That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
L544730	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
L544729	u7849	m531	KIRK	Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
L544694	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
L544693	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
L545182	u7854	m531	SULU	Tractor beam remains constant...
L545181	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
L545115	u7855	m531	UHURA	<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
L545114	u7854	m531	SULU	The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
L545015	u7854	m531	SULU	Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
L545014	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
L544706	u7855	m531	UHURA	Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
L544705	u7854	m531	SULU	Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
L544670	u7854	m531	SULU	Helm ready, sir.
L544669	u7855	m531	UHURA	Dock control reports ready, sir.
L544634	u7854	m531	SULU	Dock signals clear, Captain.
L544633	u7855	m531	UHURA	Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
L572583	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
L572582	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
L572581	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	Are you finished?
L572352	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
L572351	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	I could fight you on this.
L572348	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	"Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, ""without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?""  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are."
L572347	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
L572346	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	"I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not ""stepping down.""  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares."
L572345	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	Now, look...
L572344	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
L572343	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
L572342	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What?
L572341	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
L572340	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
L572339	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
L572338	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
L572337	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	The stock will turn.
L572336	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
L572335	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
L572334	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
L572333	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
L572332	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Admittedly...
L572331	u8101	m550	ALAN BAER	Projections were far too optimistic.
L572330	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
L572289	u8102	m550	BUSINESSMAN 2	Whereas once I was blind, now I can see.  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
L572288	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
L572287	u8102	m550	BUSINESSMAN 2	You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
L572286	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
L572285	u8102	m550	BUSINESSMAN 2	Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
L572284	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Did you play recently?
L572277	u8102	m550	BUSINESSMAN 2	Did you?  Kudos.
L572276	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
L572372	u8111	m550	MAITRE D'	I'll be right with you.
L572371	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
L572370	u8111	m550	MAITRE D'	Clean out your locker.
L572369	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I apologized, I offered to help.
L572368	u8111	m550	MAITRE D'	You don't talk to me like that.
L572367	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Then, you kiss his ass.
L572366	u8111	m550	MAITRE D'	Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
L573063	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Always.
L573062	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Underwear?
L573061	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	No.
L573060	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Boyfriend?
L573059	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Yes.
L573058	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Single?
L573057	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Julliard, yeah.
L573056	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Studied acting, I assume?
L573055	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	One brother, one sister.
L573054	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Big family... small?
L573053	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Originally, Connecticut.
L573052	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Like... where are you from?
L573051	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Like what... my favorite color... ?
L573050	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
L573049	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
L573048	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
L573047	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
L573046	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Where are you going in such a hurry?
L573045	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I have to get to the airport...
L573044	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
L573043	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Claire.
L573042	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I didn't know what else to call you.
L573041	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
L573040	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
L572997	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No!
L572996	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I have to show you...
L572995	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Don't move, you bitch... !
L572994	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
L572993	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Stop it!
L572992	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
L572991	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No...
L572990	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
L572989	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	That's not true...
L572988	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
L572987	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
L572986	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
L572985	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Let me show you...
L572984	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Shut up!
L572983	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Nicholas...
L572982	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Stop talking...
L572981	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
L572980	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Stop talking to them!
L572979	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
L572978	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I saw them kill him!
L572977	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
L572976	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
L572975	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
L572974	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Fuck you.
L572973	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
L572972	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What are you doing?
L572971	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
L572970	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
L572969	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Guess you missed it.
L572968	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	We searched the house.
L572967	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It's mine...
L572966	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Where'd you get that gun?
L572965	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What the fuck are you... ?
L572964	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
L572963	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	... what... ?
L572962	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Where'd you get that... ?
L572959	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
L572958	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	They won't...
L572957	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
L572956	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
L572955	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You call them...
L572954	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
L572953	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Who's responsible?!
L572952	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
L572951	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
L572950	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What do you think you're doing?
L572948	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Get us out!
L572947	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Nicholas...
L572946	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Get us out of here...
L572942	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
L572941	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm back from the dead.
L572940	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What are you <u>doing</u> here?
L572814	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It's out of your hands.
L572813	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What... what do you mean?
L572812	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
L572806	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
L572805	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Who is it?
L572804	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What do we do?
L572803	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Who is it?
L572801	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
L572800	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I don't know.  A lot.
L572799	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Scams, con games.  How many?
L572798	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What?
L572797	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
L572796	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	All I mean is... someone like you...
L572795	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It might be best if we didn't talk.
L572794	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
L572793	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Who the fuck cares?
L572792	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
L572791	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I didn't say anything.
L572790	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What did you say?
L572783	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
L572782	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
L572781	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
L572774	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What are you talking about... ?
L572773	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	They did the same to him as they did to you.
L572772	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	How?  How could they have gotten anything?
L572771	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
L572770	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
L572769	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	That's a lie...
L572768	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
L572767	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Then, what good are you?
L572766	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
L572765	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	"Who are ""they?"""
L572763	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
L572762	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You can talk while I drive us to the police.
L572760	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
L572759	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Get out of my car!
L572758	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
L572757	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Get out.
L572756	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What are you doing... ?
L572753	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	God, wake up, it's a con!
L572752	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What is this!?
L572746	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Nicholas...
L572745	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No!  I'm sick of this...
L572743	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Not here!  They can see.
L572742	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Wha... ?
L572741	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	They're watching.
L572740	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I don't...
L572739	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
L572738	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What's wrong?
L572737	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Take the picture out.
L572736	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
L572735	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You?
L572734	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Want anything to drink?
L572732	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
L572731	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
L572730	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
L572729	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Do you mind if I sit?
L572728	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I thought...
L572727	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Okay.
L572726	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Well... the red bra.
L572725	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
L572724	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
L572723	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Where'd you get this?
L572722	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Is this you?
L572721	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What is it?
L572719	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Come here...
L572718	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
L572717	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It's okay, dad.
L572716	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Can we talk?
L572715	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What are you doing here?
L572533	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
L572532	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Seriously?  What did they say?
L572531	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
L572530	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Keep it.
L572529	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
L572528	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
L572527	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Right.  Call me Christy.
L572526	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	The maitre d' called you Christine.
L572525	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
L572524	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Goodnight.
L572523	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
L572522	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
L572519	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
L572518	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
L572517	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	A fresh shirt...
L572516	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Hm?  Oh, yes.
L572515	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Nice.
L572514	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
L572513	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What exactly do you do?
L572508	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	That tall, bright building.  Near there.
L572507	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Where are we going?
L572500	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I think not.
L572499	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
L572498	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Why... ?
L572497	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	That's classic.
L572496	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
L572495	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
L572494	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Never did catch your name.
L572491	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	... two hundred dollars a toe.
L572490	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	That one did.
L572489	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
L572488	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	There goes a thousand dollars.
L572482	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
L572481	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You're the one who started running.
L572480	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
L572479	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You deserted me.
L572472	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Yes... well...
L572471	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	They'll love that.
L572470	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
L572468	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
L572467	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What's C.R.S.?
L572466	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	This is C.R.S.
L572465	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It's not like anyone could actually open it.
L572464	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I'll wait.
L572461	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	My hero.  Let's go.
L572460	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	There's a ladder here.
L572459	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Oh.  FIne.
L572458	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
L572457	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Please...
L572456	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	No.
L572455	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
L572454	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	You pull me up.
L572453	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
L572452	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	You first.
L572451	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'll give you a boost.
L572450	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
L572449	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	... wait for help.  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
L572448	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	If there was one.
L572447	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	"Read what it says: ""Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... """
L572446	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Why not?
L572445	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Don't even think about it.
L572441	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Never mind.
L572440	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
L572438	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
L572437	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It was a gift... from my brother.
L572436	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
L572435	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	How do you know that's the way?
L572434	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Home.
L572433	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Where are you going?
L572432	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	See you around.
L572430	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
L572429	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	There's got to be a flashlight.
L572428	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	You should be.
L572427	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm sorry, about this...
L572426	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
L572425	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
L572424	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What are you talking about?
L572423	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
L572422	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	A game?
L572421	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
L572420	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What... is... happening... ?
L572419	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You've got to be kidding.
L572418	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
L572417	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
L572414	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
L572413	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What <u>is</u> your problem?
L572412	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	This is nuts.
L572400	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	He's turning blue!
L572399	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Alright... okay...
L572398	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
L572397	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	This can't be real...
L572396	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Don't just stand there, get help!
L572395	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Oh, God... !
L572394	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I don't think he's breathing.
L572393	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Do you know what to do?
L572392	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I don't know... he fell.
L572391	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What's with him?
L572386	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
L572385	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Excuse me, I need to explain...
L572384	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
L572383	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
L572382	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	What are you babbling about, psycho?
L572381	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
L572380	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	Oh, no... you.
L572379	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Pardon me... Miss... ?
L572364	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I said I was sorry...
L572363	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
L572362	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	It was an accident.
L572361	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
L572360	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
L572359	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
L572358	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Please, don't do that...
L572357	u8103	m550	CHRISTINE	I'm so sorry.
L573038	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Did she?
L573037	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
L573036	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Where's Christine?  The waitress.
L573035	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
L573034	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Split it?
L573033	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Yeah.
L573032	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Really?
L573031	u8104	m550	CONRAD	This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
L573030	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What?
L573019	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
L573018	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
L572664	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Stop it!
L572663	u8104	m550	CONRAD	I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
L572662	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Stop this.  It's not true...
L572661	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
L572660	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
L572659	u8104	m550	CONRAD	You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
L572658	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
L572657	u8104	m550	CONRAD	No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
L572656	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What?  Connie...
L572655	u8104	m550	CONRAD	You're part of it...
L572654	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	How did those... ?
L572652	u8104	m550	CONRAD	No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
L572651	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Do you know how to change a tire?
L572650	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Really?
L572649	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	The phone's dead.
L572648	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Okay... okay.
L572647	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
L572646	u8104	m550	CONRAD	How do you know?
L572645	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It's a flat tire.  That's all.
L572644	u8104	m550	CONRAD	It's them.  They did this.
L572642	u8104	m550	CONRAD	You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
L572641	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
L572640	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
L572639	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What have they been doing to you?
L572638	u8104	m550	CONRAD	It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
L572637	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Slow down, take a breath...
L572636	u8104	m550	CONRAD	They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
L572635	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	How do you mean, exactly?
L572634	u8104	m550	CONRAD	You dodged a bullet.
L572633	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Yeah, almost...
L572632	u8104	m550	CONRAD	C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
L572631	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Who?
L572630	u8104	m550	CONRAD	They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
L572629	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What are you doing?
L572628	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
L572627	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What's this all about, Connie?
L572626	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
L572625	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Tell me where we're going.
L572192	u8104	m550	CONRAD	I know...
L572191	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
L572190	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Do it for YOU.
L572189	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm going to call.
L572188	u8104	m550	CONRAD	It doesn't matter...
L572187	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'll call them, okay?
L572186	u8104	m550	CONRAD	I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
L572182	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Why would you say that?
L572181	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Are you still on mediction?
L572180	u8104	m550	CONRAD	But, will you?
L572179	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I said I would...
L572178	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Will you?
L572177	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Okay.
L572176	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Tell me you'll call.
L572173	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Call them.  Trust me.
L572172	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Like a stroke?
L572171	u8104	m550	CONRAD	It's a profound life experience.
L572170	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	This isn't an escort service?
L572169	u8104	m550	CONRAD	You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
L572168	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Fun?
L572167	u8104	m550	CONRAD	They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
L572166	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Why?
L572165	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Trust me.  Call that number.
L572164	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Consumer Recrreation Services. What, do they make golf clubs?
L572163	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Call that number.
L572161	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You shouldn't have.
L572160	u8104	m550	CONRAD	For you.
L572159	u8104	m550	CONRAD	I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
L572158	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Really?
L572157	u8104	m550	CONRAD	No.
L572156	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You need anything?
L572155	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Yeah.
L572154	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
L572153	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
L572152	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I redecorated.  What about you?
L572151	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
L572150	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
L572149	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Elizabeth?
L572148	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Never better.
L572147	u8104	m550	CONRAD	How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
L572146	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	About me?
L572145	u8104	m550	CONRAD	So do you.  And to think I was worried...
L572144	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You look good.
L572143	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Which grad-school?
L572142	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
L572141	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	They'll be wanting it back.
L572140	u8104	m550	CONRAD	They gave me a free jacket at the door.
L572139	u8104	m550	CONRAD	That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
L572138	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Seymour Butts.  I never get tired of that one.
L572137	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Happy Birthday, man.
L572136	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
L572135	u8104	m550	CONRAD	Hey there, Nickie.
L572841	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Yes, very lucky.
L572840	u8105	m550	COUNSELOR	How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
L572839	u8105	m550	COUNSELOR	And, they didn't take that watch?
L572838	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Yes.
L572837	u8105	m550	COUNSELOR	We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
L572836	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
L572835	u8105	m550	COUNSELOR	Have you gone to the police?
L572834	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Yes.
L572833	u8105	m550	COUNSELOR	Robbed?
L572832	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
L572831	u8105	m550	COUNSELOR	It always is.
L572830	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
L572829	u8105	m550	COUNSELOR	No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
L573026	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	I know.
L573025	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'll call.  I really will.
L573024	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
L573023	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
L573022	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
L572888	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	I hope.
L572887	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'll explain someday.
L572886	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	Yes.
L572885	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
L572879	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	Of course, Nick...
L572878	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
L572877	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	There's nothing to forgive.
L572876	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
L572868	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
L572867	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
L572866	u8106	m550	ELIZABETH	What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
L572865	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I need your car, Elizabeth.
L572938	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Like, this way... sort of...
L572937	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Guess!
L572936	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	It was a different floor then...
L572935	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Where'd you pick up your checks?
L572934	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
L572933	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Where?
L572928	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
L572927	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	You don't need me...
L572922	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
L572921	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
L572920	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Drive in.
L572917	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
L572916	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
L572915	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
L572914	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
L572913	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
L572912	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
L572911	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Goddamnit, why do they do that?
L572910	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
L572909	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
L572908	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
L572907	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
L572906	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Get rid of them.
L572266	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
L572265	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
L572264	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
L572263	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
L572262	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
L572260	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	It's all down to this...
L572259	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	"Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your ""crack team""."
L572258	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Sorry to keep you waiting.
L572252	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
L572251	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Physical?
L572250	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
L572249	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	How long will these take?
L572248	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
L572247	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
L572246	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	May I make two suggestions... ?
L572245	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	And if nothing's lacking?
L572244	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	We provide whatever's lacking.
L572243	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Humor me with specifics.
L572242	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	It's different every time.
L572241	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What kind of vacation?
L572240	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
L572239	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	A game?
L572238	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Oh... it's a game.
L572237	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
L572236	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
L572235	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What's all this for?
L572234	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
L572232	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
L572231	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No, thank you.
L572230	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
L572229	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What is?
L572228	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
L572224	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Oh, here we go...
L572223	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
L572222	u8107	m550	FEINGOLD	Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
L572683	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
L572682	u8108	m550	GIRL	Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
L572681	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Don't take another step.
L572680	u8108	m550	GIRL	Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
L572679	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
L572678	u8108	m550	GIRL	I've been so lonely.
L572677	u8108	m550	GIRL	They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
L572676	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You know, these fit... perfectly.
L572675	u8108	m550	GIRL	Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
L572674	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I need the police.
L572554	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No, you didn't...
L572553	u8109	m550	HOTEL MANAGER	Didn't I give you two?
L572552	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Is there a room key?
L572551	u8109	m550	HOTEL MANAGER	Hm?
L572550	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	The key?
L572549	u8109	m550	HOTEL MANAGER	Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
L572547	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Have we met?
L572546	u8109	m550	HOTEL MANAGER	Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
L573014	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Goodnight.  Where was she?
L573013	u8110	m550	ILSA	Goodnight.  See you home.
L572709	u8110	m550	ILSA	Nobody worried about your father.
L572708	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Did you worry about him?
L572707	u8110	m550	ILSA	You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
L572706	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm just like him.
L572705	u8110	m550	ILSA	Not much, I think.
L572704	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
L572703	u8110	m550	ILSA	No.  What happened... no one expected it.
L572702	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
L572701	u8110	m550	ILSA	Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
L572700	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	He came to my mind recently, that's all.
L572699	u8110	m550	ILSA	All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
L572698	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I'm not sure.
L572697	u8110	m550	ILSA	What makes you ask?
L572617	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
L572616	u8110	m550	ILSA	I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
L572615	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
L572614	u8110	m550	ILSA	Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
L572613	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Ilsa... you're alright?
L572612	u8110	m550	ILSA	Mr. Van Orton... ?
L572314	u8110	m550	ILSA	Goodnight then.
L572313	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No, thank you.  Goodnight.
L572312	u8110	m550	ILSA	I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
L572311	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Fine.
L572310	u8110	m550	ILSA	Is everything alright?
L572201	u8110	m550	ILSA	Well... send my love, if you see him again.
L572200	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
L572199	u8110	m550	ILSA	You did?  How is he?
L572197	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Thank you.  Goodnight.
L572196	u8110	m550	ILSA	Dinner's in the oven.
L572103	u8110	m550	ILSA	Have a nice day.
L572102	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Thank you.
L572863	u8112	m550	MANAGER	There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
L572862	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Look, where is he?!
L572861	u8112	m550	MANAGER	He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
L572860	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	His behavior... ?
L572859	u8112	m550	MANAGER	There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
L572858	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Where's my brother?
L572857	u8112	m550	MANAGER	It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
L572856	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What's this about?
L572855	u8112	m550	MANAGER	Your brother.  Will you come with me?
L572854	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
L572853	u8112	m550	MANAGER	You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
L572852	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What's the trouble?
L572129	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
L572128	u8113	m550	MARIA	Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
L572127	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Under the Bleachers... by Seymour Butts.
L572126	u8113	m550	MARIA	A Mister... Seymour Butts.
L572125	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What gentleman, Maria?
L572124	u8113	m550	MARIA	A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
L572123	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	What?
L572122	u8113	m550	MARIA	I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
L572121	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I don't like her.
L572118	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I know who she is.  Take a message.
L572117	u8113	m550	MARIA	Your ex-wife.
L572115	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
L572114	u8113	m550	MARIA	I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
L572113	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
L572112	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	The Hinchberger wedding.
L572111	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No.
L572110	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
L572109	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	No.
L572108	u8113	m550	MARIA	Invitations: the Museum Gala.
L572568	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
L572567	u8115	m550	PLUMP GUY	Hey... !
L572566	u8115	m550	PLUMP GUY	Friend... why don't you back off.
L572565	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	"Is Alan Baer ""the Game?""  Is that what this is?"
L572564	u8115	m550	PLUMP GUY	Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
L572563	u8115	m550	PLUMP GUY	I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
L572562	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Why are you following me?
L572561	u8115	m550	PLUMP GUY	What the fuck... ?!
L573029	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	You warm my heart.
L573028	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
L572692	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Attempted murder.
L572691	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
L572688	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	What about the house?
L572687	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	He hasn't called back.
L572602	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Sam...  Thank you.
L572601	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
L572600	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
L572599	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	You're joking.
L572598	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
L572595	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Nothing else?
L572594	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Just what I told you.
L572593	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
L572592	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
L572591	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	You know you can.
L572590	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
L572589	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	It was a misunderstanding.
L572588	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	How concerned should I be?
L572580	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
L572579	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Nicholas...
L572573	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Follow me.
L572572	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	What's happened...
L572328	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	I checked it personally.
L572327	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Don't ask.
L572326	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Attractive...
L572325	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
L572324	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	I wasn't expecting you.
L572301	u8114	m550	NICHOLAS	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
L572300	u8116	m550	SUTHERLAND	Anything wrong... ?
L573249	u8117	m551	LUKE	<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
L573248	u8125	m551	TODD	What?
L573247	u8117	m551	LUKE	You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
L573238	u8117	m551	LUKE	It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
L573237	u8125	m551	TODD	These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
L573224	u8125	m551	TODD	Greetings fellow sheep counter.
L573223	u8117	m551	LUKE	Greetings fellow insomniac.
L573222	u8125	m551	TODD	Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
L573493	u8123	m551	NELL	Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
L573492	u8117	m551	LUKE	Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
L573391	u8117	m551	LUKE	It's somebody's idea of a joke.
L573390	u8123	m551	NELL	Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
L573337	u8117	m551	LUKE	I did okay.
L573336	u8123	m551	NELL	Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
L573335	u8117	m551	LUKE	Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
L573334	u8123	m551	NELL	The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
L573235	u8117	m551	LUKE	Who's Watts?
L573234	u8123	m551	NELL	I only saw Theo drive up.
L573217	u8117	m551	LUKE	Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
L573216	u8123	m551	NELL	Well, I... uh...
L573215	u8117	m551	LUKE	And what kind of sleeper?
L573214	u8123	m551	NELL	Uh... Nell Vance...
L573213	u8117	m551	LUKE	Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
L573552	u8119	m551	MARROW	Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
L573551	u8117	m551	LUKE	You're not telling us something.
L573539	u8119	m551	MARROW	Just stay there, Nell!
L573538	u8117	m551	LUKE	It's not going to hold your weight.
L573517	u8117	m551	LUKE	She got the child labor stuff from me.
L573516	u8119	m551	MARROW	It's a question.
L573515	u8117	m551	LUKE	Is that the question of compassion or science?
L573514	u8119	m551	MARROW	You get your money.
L573513	u8117	m551	LUKE	Do we still get paid for the week?
L573512	u8119	m551	MARROW	I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
L573346	u8117	m551	LUKE	There's a carriage house around back.
L573345	u8119	m551	MARROW	And those are Luke's and mine.
L573313	u8119	m551	MARROW	Go ahead.
L573312	u8117	m551	LUKE	Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
L573288	u8119	m551	MARROW	I've read your tests.
L573287	u8117	m551	LUKE	Why?
L573286	u8119	m551	MARROW	Because... well, I know I can trust you.
L573285	u8117	m551	LUKE	Sure.
L573284	u8119	m551	MARROW	Luke, can I talk to you?
L573283	u8119	m551	MARROW	Yeah.
L573282	u8117	m551	LUKE	That could have been worse.
L573265	u8119	m551	MARROW	I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
L573264	u8117	m551	LUKE	So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
L573226	u8117	m551	LUKE	Greetings.
L573225	u8119	m551	MARROW	And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
L573582	u8117	m551	LUKE	We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
L573581	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell!
L573577	u8117	m551	LUKE	Where in the hell can she be.
L573576	u8124	m551	THEO	Was sure she'd be in here.
L573570	u8117	m551	LUKE	-- how much is this car worth?
L573569	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell --
L573550	u8124	m551	THEO	Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
L573549	u8117	m551	LUKE	You used the wrong test.
L573528	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe someday.
L573527	u8117	m551	LUKE	You want company?
L573526	u8124	m551	THEO	Yeah.
L573525	u8117	m551	LUKE	All night?
L573524	u8124	m551	THEO	That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
L573523	u8117	m551	LUKE	You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
L573522	u8124	m551	THEO	We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
L573469	u8117	m551	LUKE	The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
L573468	u8124	m551	THEO	Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
L573396	u8124	m551	THEO	No.
L573395	u8117	m551	LUKE	So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
L573394	u8124	m551	THEO	You could have.
L573393	u8117	m551	LUKE	I didn't do it.
L573348	u8124	m551	THEO	He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
L573347	u8117	m551	LUKE	Well, this lot is full!
L573309	u8124	m551	THEO	Luke.
L573308	u8117	m551	LUKE	Hey!  I heard screaming...
L573291	u8124	m551	THEO	And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
L573290	u8117	m551	LUKE	He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
L573252	u8117	m551	LUKE	Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
L573251	u8124	m551	THEO	The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
L573099	u8119	m551	MARROW	This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
L573098	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
L573097	u8119	m551	MARROW	She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
L573096	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	I, I just can't...
L573095	u8119	m551	MARROW	No.
L573094	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Does she know that's why you're using her?
L573093	u8119	m551	MARROW	No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
L573092	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	You don't believe in the paranormal.
L573091	u8119	m551	MARROW	And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
L573090	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
L573089	u8119	m551	MARROW	Mary, I'll meet you outside.
L573088	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Are you working with her?
L573087	u8119	m551	MARROW	But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
L573086	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
L573085	u8119	m551	MARROW	No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
L573084	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	And that will be a good place to end this study.
L573083	u8119	m551	MARROW	Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
L573081	u8119	m551	MARROW	Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
L573080	u8118	m551	MALCOLM	It's still an electric shock!
L573606	u8123	m551	NELL	Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
L573605	u8119	m551	MARROW	What'll happen to us, Nell?
L573595	u8123	m551	NELL	No --
L573594	u8119	m551	MARROW	Come on.
L573593	u8123	m551	NELL	My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
L573592	u8119	m551	MARROW	No.
L573568	u8123	m551	NELL	Then who called me?
L573567	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
L573566	u8123	m551	NELL	But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
L573544	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell.  You will come here now.
L573543	u8123	m551	NELL	The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
L573502	u8123	m551	NELL	Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
L573501	u8119	m551	MARROW	Why would we want to do that, Nell?
L573495	u8123	m551	NELL	It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
L573494	u8119	m551	MARROW	I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
L573486	u8123	m551	NELL	And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
L573485	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
L573433	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
L573432	u8119	m551	MARROW	What is that tune?
L573431	u8123	m551	NELL	It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
L573430	u8119	m551	MARROW	I don't know.
L573429	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573428	u8119	m551	MARROW	Someone is playing with you.
L573411	u8123	m551	NELL	Sure.
L573410	u8119	m551	MARROW	You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
L573409	u8123	m551	NELL	Welcome Home.
L573408	u8119	m551	MARROW	It was.
L573407	u8123	m551	NELL	It was a stupid thing to do.
L573406	u8119	m551	MARROW	I don't know.
L573405	u8123	m551	NELL	Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
L573404	u8119	m551	MARROW	I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
L573403	u8123	m551	NELL	Are you coming to confess?
L573386	u8119	m551	MARROW	No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
L573385	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
L573384	u8119	m551	MARROW	Hmm.
L573383	u8123	m551	NELL	I got more scared.
L573382	u8119	m551	MARROW	And then what happened?
L573381	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.
L573380	u8119	m551	MARROW	Like she smelled it too?
L573379	u8123	m551	NELL	I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
L573378	u8119	m551	MARROW	What happened after you smelled it?
L573377	u8123	m551	NELL	I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
L573376	u8119	m551	MARROW	So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
L573375	u8123	m551	NELL	In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
L573374	u8119	m551	MARROW	All right...
L573373	u8123	m551	NELL	It was very specific.
L573372	u8119	m551	MARROW	What did it smell like?
L573371	u8123	m551	NELL	That smell... oh, God.
L573370	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell!  What's wrong?
L573326	u8119	m551	MARROW	For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
L573325	u8123	m551	NELL	Sorry.
L573318	u8119	m551	MARROW	How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
L573317	u8123	m551	NELL	Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
L573316	u8119	m551	MARROW	The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
L573271	u8119	m551	MARROW	But there's a sad catch to the story.
L573270	u8123	m551	NELL	All the carvings.
L573258	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
L573257	u8119	m551	MARROW	You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
L573231	u8119	m551	MARROW	Well... we're glad to have you.
L573230	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
L573229	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
L573228	u8123	m551	NELL	You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
L573227	u8119	m551	MARROW	Eleanor, how was the drive?
L573273	u8119	m551	MARROW	There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
L573272	u8120	m551	MARY	What happened?
L573121	u8119	m551	MARROW	Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
L573120	u8120	m551	MARY	This is where we're going?
L573119	u8119	m551	MARROW	That?  That's Hill House.
L573118	u8120	m551	MARY	What's this?  What's this... this picture?
L573113	u8119	m551	MARROW	Good.
L573112	u8120	m551	MARY	Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
L573111	u8119	m551	MARROW	Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
L573110	u8120	m551	MARY	How'd I know it was for you?
L573109	u8119	m551	MARROW	Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
L573108	u8120	m551	MARY	Test it.
L573107	u8119	m551	MARROW	You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
L573105	u8120	m551	MARY	You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
L573104	u8119	m551	MARROW	What?
L573103	u8120	m551	MARY	You know what he's really upset about?
L573627	u8124	m551	THEO	But the experiment was a failure.
L573626	u8119	m551	MARROW	I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
L573625	u8124	m551	THEO	I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
L573614	u8119	m551	MARROW	Nell, what do we do?
L573613	u8124	m551	THEO	Oh God, we can't get out!
L573554	u8119	m551	MARROW	No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
L573553	u8124	m551	THEO	He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
L573548	u8119	m551	MARROW	I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
L573547	u8124	m551	THEO	She needs help.
L573520	u8124	m551	THEO	Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
L573519	u8119	m551	MARROW	Is she asleep?
L573497	u8124	m551	THEO	How could you do this to people?
L573496	u8119	m551	MARROW	Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
L573480	u8124	m551	THEO	It's okay... we're all here...
L573479	u8119	m551	MARROW	Get a blanket!
L573342	u8119	m551	MARROW	Mary came with me.
L573341	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe they're Mary's.
L573329	u8119	m551	MARROW	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
L573328	u8124	m551	THEO	Well this is a cozy breakfast.
L573267	u8119	m551	MARROW	Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
L573266	u8124	m551	THEO	When do we take the tests?
L573233	u8124	m551	THEO	No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
L573232	u8119	m551	MARROW	Have either of you seen David Watts?
L573425	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
L573424	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573423	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	She was unhappy.
L573422	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.
L573421	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Why'd she kill herself?
L573420	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573415	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
L573414	u8123	m551	NELL	Who?
L573413	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	That's where she hanged herself.
L573149	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
L573148	u8123	m551	NELL	Is there something about the house?
L573147	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
L573146	u8123	m551	NELL	Why do you need a chain like that?
L573144	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
L573143	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
L573142	u8123	m551	NELL	Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
L573141	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
L573140	u8123	m551	NELL	Oh!  You scared me.
L573139	u8121	m551	MR. DUDLEY	What do you want?
L573185	u8123	m551	NELL	No one will come any nearer than that.
L573184	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
L573166	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
L573165	u8123	m551	NELL	Why would we --
L573164	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
L573163	u8123	m551	NELL	Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
L573162	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
L573161	u8123	m551	NELL	They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
L573156	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	So far.
L573155	u8123	m551	NELL	Mrs. Dudley.
L573154	u8122	m551	MRS. DUDLEY	It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
L573590	u8124	m551	THEO	Then let's go get you one.
L573589	u8123	m551	NELL	Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
L573586	u8123	m551	NELL	Just had to be sure.
L573585	u8124	m551	THEO	What'd you come back for, babe?
L573561	u8124	m551	THEO	Come on!  Why are we waiting?
L573560	u8123	m551	NELL	They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
L573511	u8124	m551	THEO	I do.
L573510	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't think I want any.
L573509	u8124	m551	THEO	I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
L573500	u8123	m551	NELL	-- but the painting!
L573499	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
L573498	u8123	m551	NELL	This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
L573484	u8123	m551	NELL	Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
L573483	u8124	m551	THEO	Nell, what happened?
L573472	u8123	m551	NELL	Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
L573471	u8124	m551	THEO	Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
L573466	u8123	m551	NELL	-- What do you think?
L573465	u8124	m551	THEO	Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
L573458	u8124	m551	THEO	Okay.
L573457	u8123	m551	NELL	I think so.
L573456	u8124	m551	THEO	Are you sure?
L573454	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
L573453	u8124	m551	THEO	My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
L573452	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know, you know...
L573451	u8124	m551	THEO	You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
L573449	u8124	m551	THEO	I have a loft.
L573448	u8123	m551	NELL	I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
L573447	u8124	m551	THEO	Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
L573446	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
L573445	u8123	m551	NELL	Red.  What else?
L573444	u8124	m551	THEO	Well?
L573443	u8123	m551	NELL	I've never had a pedicure before.
L573442	u8124	m551	THEO	Just think about one thing right now: What color?
L573441	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know what to think anymore.
L573440	u8124	m551	THEO	Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
L573438	u8124	m551	THEO	Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
L573437	u8123	m551	NELL	There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
L573436	u8124	m551	THEO	That's so sad.
L573400	u8124	m551	THEO	I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
L573399	u8123	m551	NELL	Why?
L573398	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe you did it yourself.
L573397	u8123	m551	NELL	Theo... Did you?
L573369	u8123	m551	NELL	No, it's getting worse.
L573368	u8124	m551	THEO	Is it over?
L573367	u8124	m551	THEO	Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
L573366	u8123	m551	NELL	David?
L573358	u8123	m551	NELL	David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
L573357	u8124	m551	THEO	David.
L573356	u8123	m551	NELL	What's his first name?
L573355	u8124	m551	THEO	Watts?
L573350	u8124	m551	THEO	Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
L573349	u8123	m551	NELL	How could he have left without his keys?
L573332	u8124	m551	THEO	I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
L573331	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
L573315	u8123	m551	NELL	You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
L573314	u8124	m551	THEO	If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
L573303	u8124	m551	THEO	You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
L573302	u8123	m551	NELL	Good night, Theo.
L573301	u8124	m551	THEO	No.  The world has missed you.
L573300	u8123	m551	NELL	Yes.  I've missed it.
L573299	u8124	m551	THEO	You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
L573293	u8124	m551	THEO	The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
L573292	u8123	m551	NELL	A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
L573209	u8124	m551	THEO	You're okay.
L573208	u8123	m551	NELL	I love this house.  I really love this house.
L573203	u8123	m551	NELL	I know.
L573202	u8124	m551	THEO	Jeez.
L573198	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
L573197	u8124	m551	THEO	A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
L573196	u8123	m551	NELL	No.
L573195	u8124	m551	THEO	My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
L573194	u8123	m551	NELL	Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
L573193	u8124	m551	THEO	Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
L573192	u8123	m551	NELL	Not really.
L573191	u8124	m551	THEO	That depends.
L573190	u8123	m551	NELL	I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
L573189	u8124	m551	THEO	What do you do?
L573188	u8123	m551	NELL	That's why we're here.
L573187	u8124	m551	THEO	Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
L573178	u8123	m551	NELL	I don't know what you mean.
L573177	u8124	m551	THEO	Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
L573176	u8123	m551	NELL	It's all I could afford.
L573175	u8124	m551	THEO	That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
L573174	u8123	m551	NELL	Fifteen dollars.
L573173	u8124	m551	THEO	What did it cost?
L573172	u8123	m551	NELL	This?  It's from a thrift shop.
L573171	u8124	m551	THEO	And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
L575334	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Because --
L575333	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Why not?
L575332	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	No.
L575329	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
L575328	u8126	m552	ADHARA	We think?
L575327	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	We think someone is here.
L575105	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I sure hope so.
L575104	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
L575103	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
L575102	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
L575101	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	What's the matter?
L575100	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
L575099	u8126	m552	ADHARA	I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
L574964	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I'm a gracious host.
L574963	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
L574955	u8126	m552	ADHARA	It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
L574954	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	We all did.
L574953	u8126	m552	ADHARA	I like the colors.
L574797	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Sure.
L574796	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
L574795	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Who?
L574794	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Italian.
L574793	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I'm sorry.
L574792	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Italian?
L574778	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Oh, god.
L574777	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	That's what Gordon's always saying.
L574776	u8126	m552	ADHARA	For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
L574775	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
L574774	u8126	m552	ADHARA	You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
L574773	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
L574772	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Like you.
L574771	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
L574770	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Why?
L574769	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Anything but Japanese.
L574768	u8126	m552	ADHARA	What kind of food?
L574767	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	As soon as you get dressed.
L574766	u8126	m552	ADHARA	It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
L574765	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	It's not a compliment.
L574764	u8126	m552	ADHARA	It's not a knock.
L574763	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I'm so glad we're having this chat.
L574762	u8126	m552	ADHARA	No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
L574761	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I'm not.
L574760	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Well, you're certainly not a person.
L574759	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Am I a thing?
L574758	u8126	m552	ADHARA	I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
L574757	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Not for you, clearly.
L574756	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Is that a problem?
L574755	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
L574754	u8126	m552	ADHARA	Then what good is he?
L574753	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
L574752	u8126	m552	ADHARA	I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
L574751	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
L574750	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
L574749	u8126	m552	ADHARA	I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
L574748	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
L575049	u8127	m552	AVERY	That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
L575048	u8137	m552	STACY	Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
L575047	u8127	m552	AVERY	See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
L575046	u8137	m552	STACY	This is un-fucking professional.
L575045	u8127	m552	AVERY	I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
L575044	u8137	m552	STACY	What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
L575043	u8127	m552	AVERY	When you find the guy, you'll know.
L575042	u8137	m552	STACY	Where do we go?
L575041	u8127	m552	AVERY	Same as last time -- the rest after.
L575040	u8137	m552	STACY	Okay.
L575039	u8127	m552	AVERY	How'd you like to kill someone for me?
L575038	u8137	m552	STACY	Not bad.
L575037	u8127	m552	AVERY	How they goin', kid?
L575036	u8127	m552	AVERY	Come over here.
L575035	u8137	m552	STACY	Hey.
L575032	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
L575031	u8127	m552	AVERY	There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
L575030	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	You think I'm staying?
L575029	u8127	m552	AVERY	You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
L575028	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
L575027	u8127	m552	AVERY	We'll find him.
L575026	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
L575025	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
L575024	u8127	m552	AVERY	And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
L575023	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
L575022	u8127	m552	AVERY	Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
L575021	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
L575019	u8127	m552	AVERY	What did you tell them.
L575018	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
L575017	u8127	m552	AVERY	You should have let me do the talking.
L574789	u8127	m552	AVERY	Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
L574788	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I thought he was in prison, in England.
L574787	u8127	m552	AVERY	No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
L574786	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Our black friends?
L574785	u8127	m552	AVERY	"What the papers used to call a ""gangland slaying."""
L574784	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	What kind?
L574783	u8127	m552	AVERY	There's been some trouble downtown.
L574782	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	What.
L575208	u8137	m552	STACY	I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
L575207	u8128	m552	CREEP	Huh?
L575206	u8137	m552	STACY	I wouldn't talk.
L575205	u8128	m552	CREEP	Fuck you.
L575204	u8137	m552	STACY	Let him break - he likes to break.
L575203	u8128	m552	CREEP	You broke last time.
L574705	u8129	m552	DEALER	No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
L574704	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah?
L574703	u8129	m552	DEALER	I can take care of the paperwork.

L574697	u8142	m552	WILSON	Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
L574696	u8129	m552	DEALER	You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
L574695	u8142	m552	WILSON	England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
L574694	u8129	m552	DEALER	Oh really?  Where you from?
L574692	u8129	m552	DEALER	Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
L574691	u8130	m552	ED	CQ what?
L574690	u8129	m552	DEALER	Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.

L574686	u8129	m552	DEALER	Man knows what he likes.
L575273	u8142	m552	WILSON	The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
L575272	u8130	m552	ED	What post office?
L575271	u8142	m552	WILSON	Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.

L574619	u8130	m552	ED	I mean, what has it been -- six months?
L574618	u8142	m552	WILSON	No reason.
L574617	u8130	m552	ED	I didn't expect anyone.
L574613	u8142	m552	WILSON	You're home, then.
L574612	u8130	m552	ED	Eduardo.  Rama.
L574611	u8142	m552	WILSON	Edward Rama?
L575310	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
L575309	u8130	m552	ED	I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
L575308	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Hard to miss.
L575307	u8130	m552	ED	... Reminds me of Jennifer.
L575305	u8131	m552	ELAINE	No, but I know what he means.
L575304	u8130	m552	ED	Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
L575245	u8130	m552	ED	Hell, no.  I started writing.
L575244	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You just cooking then?
L575243	u8130	m552	ED	Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
L575242	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Well, those are the breaks.
L575241	u8130	m552	ED	Didn't get it.
L575240	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Really.
L575239	u8130	m552	ED	I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
L575238	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Probably.
L575237	u8130	m552	ED	Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
L575236	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Uh-huh.
L575235	u8130	m552	ED	Same.
L575234	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Not much -- you?
L575233	u8130	m552	ED	What d'you say, Elaine?
L575275	u8142	m552	WILSON	Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
L575274	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
L575270	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Poor baby.
L575269	u8142	m552	WILSON	You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
L575268	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
L575231	u8142	m552	WILSON	Bloke told me.
L575230	u8131	m552	ELAINE	How do you know?
L575229	u8142	m552	WILSON	That's where Valentine's scarpered.
L575228	u8131	m552	ELAINE	What's in Big Sur?
L575227	u8142	m552	WILSON	Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
L575226	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
L575225	u8142	m552	WILSON	Fancy it?
L575224	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
L575223	u8142	m552	WILSON	How far?
L575222	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Up the coast.
L575221	u8142	m552	WILSON	Where's Big Sur?
L575172	u8142	m552	WILSON	I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
L575171	u8131	m552	ELAINE	She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
L575170	u8142	m552	WILSON	"She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  ""If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya.""  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  ""I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now"" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke."
L575169	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
L575168	u8142	m552	WILSON	Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
L575167	u8131	m552	ELAINE	She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
L575166	u8142	m552	WILSON	Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
L575164	u8142	m552	WILSON	I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
L575163	u8131	m552	ELAINE	A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
L575162	u8142	m552	WILSON	I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
L575158	u8142	m552	WILSON	Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
L575157	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Minor officials bother you, don't they?
L575156	u8142	m552	WILSON	Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
L575155	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Won't he be looking for you about now?
L575154	u8142	m552	WILSON	You sound like my fucking probation officer.
L575153	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I guess you're just habitual.
L575152	u8142	m552	WILSON	Black market during the war.
L575151	u8131	m552	ELAINE	What'd your father do?
L575150	u8142	m552	WILSON	Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
L575149	u8131	m552	ELAINE	He alive to see this?
L575148	u8142	m552	WILSON	Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
L575147	u8131	m552	ELAINE	What about your grandmother?
L575146	u8142	m552	WILSON	Not that I recall.
L575145	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
L575144	u8142	m552	WILSON	I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
L575143	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
L575142	u8142	m552	WILSON	I've 'ardly ever left it.
L575141	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Only in the movies.
L575140	u8142	m552	WILSON	You ever been to London?
L575139	u8131	m552	ELAINE	-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
L575095	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Pushing the legal limit even then.
L575094	u8142	m552	WILSON	Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
L575093	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I don't believe it.
L575092	u8142	m552	WILSON	It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
L575091	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
L575090	u8142	m552	WILSON	Just now?  Overnight?
L575089	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Overnight.  What about just now?
L575088	u8142	m552	WILSON	Get seven years, did you?
L575087	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Who remembers.
L575086	u8142	m552	WILSON	Did you.  What was that in aid of?
L575085	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
L575084	u8142	m552	WILSON	I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
L575083	u8131	m552	ELAINE	From pursuing your chosen profession.
L575082	u8142	m552	WILSON	Hey?
L575081	u8131	m552	ELAINE	It didn't discourage you, though.
L575080	u8142	m552	WILSON	We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
L575079	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
L575078	u8142	m552	WILSON	A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
L575077	u8131	m552	ELAINE	What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
L575076	u8142	m552	WILSON	I can see the attraction.
L575075	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
L575074	u8142	m552	WILSON	Oh, I was gonna say ...
L575073	u8131	m552	ELAINE	It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
L575072	u8142	m552	WILSON	Tell us about it.
L575071	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
L575070	u8142	m552	WILSON	You don't seem bothered.
L575069	u8131	m552	ELAINE	These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
L575068	u8142	m552	WILSON	Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
L575067	u8131	m552	ELAINE	"This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as ""the early 70's.""  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me."
L575056	u8142	m552	WILSON	And how did you get it?
L575055	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
L575054	u8142	m552	WILSON	How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
L575053	u8131	m552	ELAINE	She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
L575052	u8142	m552	WILSON	She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
L575051	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
L574918	u8131	m552	ELAINE	There's the phone.  You want his number.
L574917	u8142	m552	WILSON	I'll bloody well ask him.
L574916	u8131	m552	ELAINE	On what.  What makes you so certain.
L574915	u8142	m552	WILSON	Depends, don' it.
L574914	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
L574913	u8142	m552	WILSON	What do you think.
L574912	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You don't believe it was a car accident.
L574911	u8142	m552	WILSON	What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
L574910	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
L574909	u8142	m552	WILSON	Have you ever known me not to be.
L574908	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Are you serious.
L574907	u8142	m552	WILSON	Why not.
L574906	u8131	m552	ELAINE	So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
L574905	u8131	m552	ELAINE	-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
L574904	u8142	m552	WILSON	This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
L574903	u8131	m552	ELAINE	In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
L574902	u8142	m552	WILSON	Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
L574901	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Right.
L574900	u8142	m552	WILSON	Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
L574899	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
L574898	u8142	m552	WILSON	Various enterprises, style of thing.
L574897	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I bet.
L574896	u8142	m552	WILSON	Based in London, but with international concerns.
L574895	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I see.
L574894	u8142	m552	WILSON	Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
L574893	u8131	m552	ELAINE	What line is he in.
L574892	u8142	m552	WILSON	My employer.
L574891	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Who's Mr. Lindgren?
L574890	u8142	m552	WILSON	-- Mr. Lindgren.
L574889	u8131	m552	ELAINE	-- Your employer?
L574888	u8142	m552	WILSON	Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
L574887	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
L574884	u8142	m552	WILSON	Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
L574883	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
L574880	u8142	m552	WILSON	Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
L574879	u8131	m552	ELAINE	That's what was estimated.
L574878	u8142	m552	WILSON	I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
L574875	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Where you get your bank statements.
L574874	u8142	m552	WILSON	Something like that, yeah.
L574873	u8131	m552	ELAINE	What's that, like a P.O. box.
L574872	u8142	m552	WILSON	Nah, accommodation address.
L574871	u8131	m552	ELAINE	The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
L574870	u8142	m552	WILSON	Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
L574869	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
L574868	u8142	m552	WILSON	Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
L574867	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
L574866	u8142	m552	WILSON	He give me your address.
L574865	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
L574864	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
L574863	u8131	m552	ELAINE	And you've seen Eddie Rama.
L574862	u8142	m552	WILSON	Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
L574861	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I might've been away for the weekend.
L574860	u8142	m552	WILSON	No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
L574859	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
L574858	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yesterday.  Afternoon.
L574857	u8131	m552	ELAINE	When did you get in?
L574855	u8131	m552	ELAINE	She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
L574854	u8142	m552	WILSON	Footloose and fancy free.
L574853	u8131	m552	ELAINE	She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
L574852	u8142	m552	WILSON	In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
L574851	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You weren't disappointed in her, then.
L574850	u8142	m552	WILSON	Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
L574849	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Modelling.
L574848	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
L574847	u8131	m552	ELAINE	When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
L574846	u8142	m552	WILSON	How'd you manage that, then.
L574845	u8131	m552	ELAINE	She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
L574844	u8142	m552	WILSON	She never told Eddie, though.
L574843	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Disappointed.
L574842	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Not ashamed.
L574841	u8142	m552	WILSON	Ashamed.
L574840	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Not embarrassed.
L574839	u8142	m552	WILSON	I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
L574837	u8131	m552	ELAINE	I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
L574836	u8142	m552	WILSON	When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
L574835	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Now who's being sarcastic?
L574834	u8142	m552	WILSON	Oh, it just ended, then.
L574833	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
L574832	u8142	m552	WILSON	Said it went on for donkey's years.
L574831	u8131	m552	ELAINE	If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
L574830	u8142	m552	WILSON	Weren't you on a television series?
L574829	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
L574828	u8142	m552	WILSON	Here, are you always this sarky?
L574827	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Sounds like Beverly Hills.
L574826	u8142	m552	WILSON	... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
L574824	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Try calling me again.
L574823	u8142	m552	WILSON	Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
L574822	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
L574821	u8142	m552	WILSON	Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
L574820	u8131	m552	ELAINE	And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
L574819	u8142	m552	WILSON	Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
L574818	u8131	m552	ELAINE	In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
L574817	u8142	m552	WILSON	It was the bars, then.
L574816	u8131	m552	ELAINE	"I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- ""at Her Majesty's pleasure."""
L574815	u8142	m552	WILSON	What was that, then?
L574814	u8131	m552	ELAINE	That's not what I heard.
L574813	u8142	m552	WILSON	I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
L574812	u8131	m552	ELAINE	It's been a while.
L574811	u8142	m552	WILSON	How d'you mean?
L574810	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Been busy, have you.
L574809	u8142	m552	WILSON	Sort a few things out.
L574808	u8131	m552	ELAINE	No, why did you come here?
L574807	u8142	m552	WILSON	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
L574806	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Why did you come here?
L574805	u8142	m552	WILSON	She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
L574804	u8131	m552	ELAINE	Not her brand.
L574803	u8142	m552	WILSON	Perhaps it was the smoke.
L574802	u8131	m552	ELAINE	You look alike.
L574801	u8142	m552	WILSON	Had a feeling it was you.
L575198	u8132	m552	FEATHER	What am I doing?
L575197	u8142	m552	WILSON	And that is?
L575196	u8132	m552	FEATHER	In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
L575195	u8142	m552	WILSON	As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
L575194	u8132	m552	FEATHER	But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
L575193	u8142	m552	WILSON	Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
L575192	u8132	m552	FEATHER	Of the deal, man.
L575191	u8142	m552	WILSON	All of what?
L575190	u8132	m552	FEATHER	He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
L575189	u8142	m552	WILSON	No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
L575188	u8132	m552	FEATHER	Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
L575187	u8142	m552	WILSON	Eh?
L575186	u8132	m552	FEATHER	It was you.  Downtown.
L575185	u8142	m552	WILSON	Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
L575184	u8132	m552	FEATHER	So what's your beef, pal?
L575183	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
L575182	u8132	m552	FEATHER	That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
L575181	u8142	m552	WILSON	Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
L575180	u8132	m552	FEATHER	Yeah, I guess you are.
L575179	u8142	m552	WILSON	Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
L575178	u8132	m552	FEATHER	But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
L575177	u8142	m552	WILSON	I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
L575176	u8132	m552	FEATHER	Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
L575175	u8142	m552	WILSON	Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
L575174	u8132	m552	FEATHER	There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
L575220	u8133	m552	FIELDING	He had urgent business in the north.
L575219	u8134	m552	GRAMMS	Where is he now?
L575218	u8133	m552	FIELDING	He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
L575217	u8134	m552	GRAMMS	So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
L575216	u8133	m552	FIELDING	My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
L575215	u8134	m552	GRAMMS	Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
L575214	u8133	m552	FIELDING	Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
L575213	u8134	m552	GRAMMS	A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
L575212	u8133	m552	FIELDING	My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
L575211	u8134	m552	GRAMMS	Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
L574979	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
L574978	u8135	m552	GUY	Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
L574977	u8142	m552	WILSON	Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
L574976	u8135	m552	GUY	What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
L574975	u8142	m552	WILSON	No kidding.
L574974	u8135	m552	GUY	Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
L574973	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah?
L574972	u8135	m552	GUY	That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
L574971	u8142	m552	WILSON	Unless I'm not who I think I am.
L574970	u8135	m552	GUY	You sure?
L574969	u8142	m552	WILSON	Sorry.  Wasn't me.
L574968	u8135	m552	GUY	I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
L574967	u8142	m552	WILSON	Ian?
L574966	u8135	m552	GUY	Don't you work with Ian?
L575380	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah.
L575379	u8136	m552	LADY	The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
L575378	u8142	m552	WILSON	But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
L575377	u8142	m552	WILSON	Could do, yeah.
L575376	u8136	m552	LADY	Sounds like you need a rest.
L575375	u8142	m552	WILSON	I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
L575374	u8136	m552	LADY	But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
L575373	u8142	m552	WILSON	Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
L575372	u8136	m552	LADY	Nine years?  Is that legal?
L575371	u8142	m552	WILSON	Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
L575370	u8136	m552	LADY	Where else?
L575369	u8142	m552	WILSON	Been away a lot.
L575368	u8136	m552	LADY	No rest for the wicked.
L575367	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
L575366	u8136	m552	LADY	You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
L575364	u8136	m552	LADY	You're a reluctant traveller, then.
L575363	u8142	m552	WILSON	I would have preferred staying home, me.
L575362	u8136	m552	LADY	I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
L575361	u8142	m552	WILSON	Yeah, that's right.
L575263	u8137	m552	STACY	While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
L575262	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	How we gonna get that lucky?
L575261	u8137	m552	STACY	Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
L575260	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	What's in it?
L575259	u8137	m552	STACY	I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
L575258	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	I don't get it.
L575257	u8137	m552	STACY	He ain't wrong.  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
L575256	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
L575255	u8137	m552	STACY	"Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs ""plausible denial."""
L575254	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	Like what.
L575253	u8137	m552	STACY	You bet.
L575252	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	You do?
L575251	u8137	m552	STACY	I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
L575250	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	What?
L575249	u8137	m552	STACY	Something's on.
L575248	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	There is?
L575247	u8137	m552	STACY	There's more than a measly few grand in this.
L575246	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
L575202	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	Lemme break.
L575201	u8137	m552	STACY	Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
L575137	u8137	m552	STACY	Any happier than any other asshole in life.
L575136	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	What d'you mean, any happier?
L575135	u8137	m552	STACY	And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
L575134	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
L575133	u8137	m552	STACY	So what.
L575132	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	She's nice lookin'.
L575131	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	That don't mean nothin'.
L575130	u8137	m552	STACY	Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
L575129	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
L575119	u8137	m552	STACY	The L.A.P.D.
L575118	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	I don't know.
L575117	u8137	m552	STACY	Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
L575116	u8137	m552	STACY	Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
L575115	u8137	m552	STACY	Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
L575114	u8137	m552	STACY	Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
L575113	u8137	m552	STACY	... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
L575112	u8137	m552	STACY	Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
L575111	u8137	m552	STACY	Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
L575110	u8137	m552	STACY	Good luck.
L575109	u8137	m552	STACY	Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
L575065	u8137	m552	STACY	The forever kind.
L575064	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	Which kind?
L575063	u8137	m552	STACY	Yeah.
L575062	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	Makin' trouble for someone?
L575061	u8137	m552	STACY	I got half.
L575060	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	Hey.
L575059	u8137	m552	STACY	Five thousand.
L575058	u8140	m552	UNCLE JOHN	How much.
L574741	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
L574740	u8142	m552	WILSON	Where is he, then?
L574739	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	What do you think?
L574738	u8142	m552	WILSON	Is Valentine here?
L574737	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
L574736	u8142	m552	WILSON	You know her?
L574735	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	Jennifer Wilson.
L574734	u8142	m552	WILSON	I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
L574733	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	So why would he want to see you.
L574732	u8142	m552	WILSON	I doubt it.
L574731	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	He's expecting you?
L574730	u8142	m552	WILSON	Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
L574729	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
L574728	u8142	m552	WILSON	Walked.
L574727	u8138	m552	SUPERVISOR	How'd you get in here.
L575301	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
L575300	u8139	m552	SUSAN	It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
L575299	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Go now.
L575298	u8139	m552	SUSAN	Who's looking for you?
L575297	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	In a couple of days this whole thing --
L575296	u8139	m552	SUSAN	Are you finished?
L575295	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
L575294	u8139	m552	SUSAN	You know I don't live with him.
L575293	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Is he here?
L575292	u8139	m552	SUSAN	-- You know his name is Frank.
L575291	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
L575288	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Susan.
L575287	u8139	m552	SUSAN	Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
L575286	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	No trouble.
L575285	u8139	m552	SUSAN	What kind of trouble are you in?
L575284	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Sure you do.
L575283	u8139	m552	SUSAN	I don't want you here, Terry.
L575282	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	You've made it ... brighter.
L575281	u8139	m552	SUSAN	They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
L575280	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I miss my kids.
L575279	u8139	m552	SUSAN	Since when?
L575278	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Exercising my visitation rights.
L575277	u8139	m552	SUSAN	What are you doing here?
L575276	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Hello there.
L575355	u8142	m552	WILSON	<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
L575354	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
L575352	u8142	m552	WILSON	About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
L575351	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Tell you ...
L575350	u8142	m552	WILSON	Tell me.
L575349	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	What.
L575000	u8142	m552	WILSON	Be seein' you.
L574999	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Thanks.  You, too.
L574995	u8142	m552	WILSON	Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
L574994	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
L574993	u8142	m552	WILSON	Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
L574992	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	I don't.
L574991	u8142	m552	WILSON	You must know Ian.
L574990	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Ah.
L574989	u8142	m552	WILSON	EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
L574988	u8141	m552	VALENTINE	Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
L574987	u8142	m552	WILSON	Pleasure.
L576746	u8159	m554	BAILEY	I'm in.
L576745	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
L576730	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Great.
L576729	u8159	m554	BAILEY	Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
L576338	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	No.
L576337	u8159	m554	BAILEY	There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
L576336	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	It better be good.
L576335	u8159	m554	BAILEY	Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
L576226	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
L576225	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Why not?
L576224	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
L576223	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
L576222	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	Looks like the curse is still at work.
L576220	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
L576219	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	Anything missin'?
L576218	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Someone broke into this room.
L576217	u8160	m554	BEAUREGARD	I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
L576216	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
L576777	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
L576776	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
L576775	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
L576774	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Sweet Jesus!
L576624	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
L576623	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
L576622	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
L576621	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I'll go down and speak to him.
L576620	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
L576619	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
L576486	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I appreciate that.
L576485	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
L576491	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
L576490	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I don't want to scare people.
L576489	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Yes.
L576488	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Do they have to wear uniforms?
L576487	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
L576484	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
L576483	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
L576482	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
L576481	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
L576827	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
L576826	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Fifteen... what's next?
L576825	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Oh Jesus...
L576824	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
L576823	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
L576821	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
L576820	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Hurry up!
L576819	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
L576818	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Let's go!
L576817	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Battery's dead.  Shit.
L576816	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Calm down.  I found it!
L576815	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Forget it!
L576814	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
L576813	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	What's the combination?
L576812	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	Behind you.
L576811	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Where's the walk-in safe?
L576810	u8161	m554	CUTHBERT	I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
L576789	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
L576788	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
L576787	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Where the hell are you?
L576786	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
L576699	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	Like hell!
L576698	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Ippolito!  Get back here!
L576696	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You said the system couldn't fail!
L576695	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
L576694	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What doors?
L576693	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
L576562	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
L576561	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
L576560	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
L576559	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
L576558	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
L576557	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
L576556	u8166	m554	IPPOLITO	This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
L576985	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
L576984	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
L576867	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Everybody.  Get behind me.
L576866	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
L576865	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I smell it.  It's here.
L576860	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
L576859	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	The sub-basement?
L576858	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
L576851	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
L576850	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
L576552	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
L576551	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I think I should come with you.
L576550	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Apparently it's huge.
L576549	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	How big is the sub-basement?
L576400	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
L576399	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
L576398	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
L576392	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Correct.
L576391	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
L576390	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
L576389	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What happened to them?
L576371	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Oh.
L576370	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
L576369	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
L576368	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I believed them.
L576367	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
L576366	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
L576365	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	"I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than ""the dog ate my homework""."
L576341	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Unfortunately, no.
L576340	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	You're kidding.
L576339	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	If you don't mind, this could be important.
L576334	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
L576333	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	So the method of death is the only connection?
L576332	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
L576331	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
L576330	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
L576329	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Call me Vince.
L576328	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Lieutenant --
L576327	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
L576326	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
L576325	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
L576324	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
L576323	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
L576322	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
L576299	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
L576298	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Whose footprints?
L576297	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
L576296	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where's the head?
L576295	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	We need light in here, stat.
L576294	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Mind if I have a look?
L576293	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What's left of it.
L576292	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	The body?
L576291	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
L576290	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
L576289	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
L576288	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Who are you?  The undertaker?
L576998	u8164	m554	FROCK	The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
L576997	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
L576538	u8164	m554	FROCK	This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
L576537	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Pardon my French, but bull shit.
L576536	u8164	m554	FROCK	Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
L576532	u8164	m554	FROCK	May I see that?
L576531	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Look.  It's some kind of letter.
L576509	u8164	m554	FROCK	I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
L576508	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	This place is a maze.
L576945	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I'd say we're in its home.
L576944	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
L576941	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
L576940	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What's that doing here?
L576939	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Dr. John Whittlesley.
L576938	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What does it say?
L576936	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	All right everybody, hold up!
L576935	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What's that?
L576934	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Not so loud.
L576933	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
L576888	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Oh shit.
L576887	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
L576862	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
L576861	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
L576843	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	I know.
L576842	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	It's still back there!
L576691	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
L576690	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What happened?!
L576664	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
L576663	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	Got my hands full here.
L576662	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Dr. Green has to see you!
L576661	u8162	m554	D'AGOSTA	What is it?
L576660	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Lieutenant!  It's me.
L576388	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
L576387	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
L576386	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Curious.  There's something missing.
L576385	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
L576384	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
L576383	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	What are we talking about here?
L576377	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
L576376	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I hope you liked it.
L576375	u8163	m554	DR. ZIEWZIC	Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
L576374	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
L576992	u8164	m554	FROCK	Look who's here, Margo.
L576991	u8170	m554	MARGO	Dr. Frock?
L576841	u8164	m554	FROCK	Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
L576840	u8170	m554	MARGO	We will.
L576839	u8164	m554	FROCK	Come back and get me.
L576830	u8170	m554	MARGO	No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
L576829	u8164	m554	FROCK	I'm coming with you.
L576806	u8170	m554	MARGO	That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
L576805	u8164	m554	FROCK	We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
L576804	u8170	m554	MARGO	None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
L576707	u8164	m554	FROCK	It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
L576706	u8170	m554	MARGO	What's that?
L576705	u8164	m554	FROCK	Don't stop now.
L576704	u8170	m554	MARGO	Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
L576702	u8170	m554	MARGO	I think so.
L576701	u8164	m554	FROCK	Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
L576700	u8170	m554	MARGO	What's going on?
L576657	u8164	m554	FROCK	It's like ringing the dinner bell.
L576656	u8170	m554	MARGO	And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
L576655	u8164	m554	FROCK	Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
L576654	u8170	m554	MARGO	With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
L576653	u8164	m554	FROCK	So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
L576652	u8170	m554	MARGO	"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm... poor eyesight.  ""External mucoid nasal glands,""... very keen scent... ""Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."""
L576651	u8164	m554	FROCK	"Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  ""He Who Walks on All Fours."""
L576650	u8170	m554	MARGO	"All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  ""Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters."" That means it's highly intelligent. ""Quadrupedal."""
L576635	u8170	m554	MARGO	"But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  ""Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."""
L576634	u8164	m554	FROCK	That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
L576633	u8170	m554	MARGO	Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
L576630	u8170	m554	MARGO	Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
L576629	u8164	m554	FROCK	Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
L576628	u8170	m554	MARGO	Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
L576627	u8164	m554	FROCK	Like the claw.
L576578	u8164	m554	FROCK	They're eggs.
L576577	u8170	m554	MARGO	What are they?
L576576	u8164	m554	FROCK	Margo, these aren't seed pods.
L576569	u8164	m554	FROCK	You're right.
L576568	u8170	m554	MARGO	Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
L576567	u8164	m554	FROCK	I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
L576566	u8170	m554	MARGO	What is it?
L576565	u8164	m554	FROCK	Let me see the plant press.
L576564	u8170	m554	MARGO	A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
L576563	u8164	m554	FROCK	I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
L576311	u8164	m554	FROCK	Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
L576310	u8170	m554	MARGO	That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
L576258	u8164	m554	FROCK	Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
L576257	u8170	m554	MARGO	You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
L576256	u8164	m554	FROCK	This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
L576255	u8164	m554	FROCK	You must.
L576254	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm not giving up.
L576253	u8164	m554	FROCK	Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
L576252	u8164	m554	FROCK	Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
L576251	u8170	m554	MARGO	Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
L576250	u8164	m554	FROCK	With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
L576249	u8170	m554	MARGO	My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
L576248	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
L576247	u8170	m554	MARGO	How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
L576246	u8164	m554	FROCK	No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
L576245	u8170	m554	MARGO	Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
L576244	u8164	m554	FROCK	Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
L576242	u8164	m554	FROCK	That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
L576241	u8170	m554	MARGO	We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
L576240	u8164	m554	FROCK	Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
L576239	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't believe it.
L576238	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
L576996	u8164	m554	FROCK	They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
L576995	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
L576837	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Footsteps!
L576836	u8164	m554	FROCK	What's that?
L576834	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	He's right.
L576833	u8164	m554	FROCK	Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
L576803	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't believe it.
L576802	u8164	m554	FROCK	We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
L576546	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
L576545	u8164	m554	FROCK	I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
L576544	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where is that?
L576543	u8164	m554	FROCK	Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
L576542	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
L576541	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes.
L576540	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
L576535	u8164	m554	FROCK	Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast.
L576534	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Read it out loud.
L576533	u8164	m554	FROCK	It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
L576528	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I wouldn't be so sure.
L576527	u8164	m554	FROCK	This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
L576526	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
L576525	u8164	m554	FROCK	Something tried to get into this room!
L576511	u8164	m554	FROCK	Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
L576510	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
L576507	u8164	m554	FROCK	They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
L576506	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How many storage areas are there?
L576505	u8164	m554	FROCK	Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
L576504	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
L576208	u8170	m554	MARGO	Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
L576207	u8165	m554	HENRY	Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
L576206	u8170	m554	MARGO	Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
L576205	u8165	m554	HENRY	Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
L576204	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
L576203	u8165	m554	HENRY	What do you do?
L576202	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes, I do.
L576201	u8165	m554	HENRY	You work here?
L576355	u8165	m554	HENRY	You're color blind.
L576354	u8169	m554	LARRY	They were yellow!
L576353	u8165	m554	HENRY	They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
L576352	u8169	m554	LARRY	It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
L576351	u8165	m554	HENRY	Like this.
L576350	u8169	m554	LARRY	And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
L576349	u8169	m554	LARRY	Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
L576348	u8165	m554	HENRY	Not that big.
L576347	u8169	m554	LARRY	Big as a house.
L576346	u8165	m554	HENRY	We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
L576280	u8165	m554	HENRY	I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
L576279	u8169	m554	LARRY	What is it?
L576278	u8165	m554	HENRY	Quiet!
L576270	u8165	m554	HENRY	Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
L576269	u8169	m554	LARRY	I don't want to go this way.
L576268	u8165	m554	HENRY	Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
L576267	u8169	m554	LARRY	We're not supposed to go back there.
L576264	u8169	m554	LARRY	Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
L576263	u8165	m554	HENRY	She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
L576262	u8169	m554	LARRY	This room sucks.
L576715	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Keep the animal quiet.
L576714	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Oh no.  I smell it.
L576711	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Another storage room.
L576710	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Jesus, what is this?
L576617	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Quiet.
L576616	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Oh... my... God!
L576613	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
L576612	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
L576611	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
L576610	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
L576606	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	He's right.  Follow me.
L576605	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
L576597	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Get back!  Now!
L576596	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Argo!  Hobbes!
L576590	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Holy mother, what is that?
L576589	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Stop!
L576586	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
L576585	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Shut them up!
L576584	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Keep the light up.  I can't see.
L576583	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	They've got something.
L576581	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
L576580	u8167	m554	JONATHAN	The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
L576579	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
L576990	u8170	m554	MARGO	Okay.
L576989	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
L576988	u8170	m554	MARGO	How about lunch?
L576987	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Got to finish this thesis sometime.
L576855	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
L576854	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Is Dr. Frock safe!
L576645	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
L576644	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Eats them?
L576643	u8170	m554	MARGO	Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
L576642	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	So what?
L576641	u8170	m554	MARGO	This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
L576639	u8170	m554	MARGO	Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
L576638	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	"4-monoxytocin is... ""A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."""
L576637	u8170	m554	MARGO	What kind of hormones?
L576636	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
L576626	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's reptilian.
L576625	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What kind of egg is it?
L576499	u8170	m554	MARGO	There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
L576498	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
L576497	u8170	m554	MARGO	Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
L576493	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
L576492	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What do you make of it, Margo?
L576316	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	What's that?
L576315	u8170	m554	MARGO	Mbwun.
L576304	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
L576303	u8170	m554	MARGO	For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
L576235	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
L576234	u8170	m554	MARGO	That's impossible.
L576233	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Frock's been fired.
L576232	u8170	m554	MARGO	What?
L576231	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	Margo, you haven't heard?
L576230	u8170	m554	MARGO	I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
L576229	u8170	m554	MARGO	But at what a price.
L576228	u8168	m554	KAWAKITA	If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
L576994	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
L576993	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
L576980	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You have to.  Do it now!
L576979	u8170	m554	MARGO	I can't!
L576978	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
L576977	u8170	m554	MARGO	Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
L576976	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I have to shoot.
L576975	u8170	m554	MARGO	Just like John.  He won't listen.
L576962	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
L576961	u8170	m554	MARGO	You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
L576960	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't believe it.
L576959	u8170	m554	MARGO	That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
L576958	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What?
L576957	u8170	m554	MARGO	No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
L576947	u8170	m554	MARGO	Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
L576946	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We're not going to make the storage room!
L576931	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It's coming.  Run.
L576930	u8170	m554	MARGO	You smell that?
L576929	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Oh God!  Help!
L576928	u8170	m554	MARGO	Help someone!
L576911	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
L576910	u8170	m554	MARGO	That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
L576909	u8170	m554	MARGO	The answer's right in front of us.
L576908	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How?
L576907	u8170	m554	MARGO	We have to try and draw it off!
L576883	u8170	m554	MARGO	I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
L576882	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	For what?
L576881	u8170	m554	MARGO	No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
L576880	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Then it won't go after the others?
L576879	u8170	m554	MARGO	I think... it means it's full.
L576878	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
L576877	u8170	m554	MARGO	Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
L576876	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What happened?
L576874	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	It's scared of me.
L576873	u8170	m554	MARGO	What is it doing?
L576869	u8170	m554	MARGO	What are you going to do?
L576868	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Hide quickly!
L576857	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
L576856	u8170	m554	MARGO	Is there another way around?
L576848	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Vince!
L576847	u8170	m554	MARGO	The planetarium!
L576846	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	That was D'Agosta.
L576832	u8170	m554	MARGO	Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
L576831	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
L576808	u8170	m554	MARGO	We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
L576807	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
L576801	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
L576800	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
L576799	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
L576727	u8170	m554	MARGO	That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
L576726	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
L576725	u8170	m554	MARGO	Wounded?
L576724	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Gone.
L576723	u8170	m554	MARGO	You're not.  Where is it?
L576722	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
L576721	u8170	m554	MARGO	Pendergast?  Are you all right?
L576502	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
L576501	u8170	m554	MARGO	When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
L576500	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Genetic damage?
L576468	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
L576467	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What was it?
L576466	u8170	m554	MARGO	All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
L576465	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	They're all heavily armed.
L576464	u8170	m554	MARGO	I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
L576463	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Dr. Green...
L576459	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	All right.  If you're positive.
L576458	u8170	m554	MARGO	That's not what I saw.
L576457	u8170	m554	MARGO	Behind me.  Over there.
L576456	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where did you see it?
L576455	u8170	m554	MARGO	It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
L576454	u8170	m554	MARGO	You were behind me?  Running after me?
L576453	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
L576452	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't know.
L576451	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What happened?
L576445	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
L576444	u8170	m554	MARGO	I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
L576443	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Where would we find it?
L576442	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Would you mind showing it to me?
L576441	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
L576440	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
L576439	u8170	m554	MARGO	My God.  Then it was an animal.
L576438	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
L576437	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't understand.
L576436	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
L576435	u8170	m554	MARGO	No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
L576434	u8170	m554	MARGO	No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
L576433	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	What happened?
L576432	u8170	m554	MARGO	"Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a ""monster species"".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years."
L576431	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	A monster?
L576430	u8170	m554	MARGO	A legendary monster called Mbwun.
L576429	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
L576428	u8170	m554	MARGO	He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
L576427	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You were afraid of him, weren't you?
L576426	u8170	m554	MARGO	That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
L576425	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
L576424	u8170	m554	MARGO	How did you know that?
L576423	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You were going to be married.
L576422	u8170	m554	MARGO	Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
L576421	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You loved him.
L576420	u8170	m554	MARGO	John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
L576419	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
L576418	u8170	m554	MARGO	I don't understand.
L576417	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
L576416	u8170	m554	MARGO	And John?
L576415	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
L576414	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	You have time to talk?
L576413	u8170	m554	MARGO	If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
L576412	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Maybe not.
L576411	u8170	m554	MARGO	Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
L576410	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
L576409	u8170	m554	MARGO	With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
L576408	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	How does it work?
L576407	u8170	m554	MARGO	An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
L576406	u8171	m554	PENDERGAST	Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
L580484	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	You're not FBI agents.
L580483	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Well, we're FBI agents.
L580482	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	We don't even know you.
L580481	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think you better tell us.
L580478	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
L580477	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	Not supposed to talk about it.
L580475	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	Yeah.
L580474	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Do you live around here?
L580219	u8197	m556	MULDER	Sorry. Don't have one.
L580218	u8189	m556	BARMAID	Why don't you go home to the old lady --
L580217	u8197	m556	MULDER	Does what?
L580216	u8189	m556	BARMAID	I think that about does it, Spooky.
L580215	u8197	m556	MULDER	"What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. ""Spooky,"" they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time."
L580214	u8189	m556	BARMAID	What do you do?
L580213	u8189	m556	BARMAID	A woman?  Work.
L580212	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yup.
L580211	u8189	m556	BARMAID	Poopy day?
L580646	u8190	m556	BYERS	Me?
L580645	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need your clothes, Byers.
L580635	u8197	m556	MULDER	They took her --
L580634	u8190	m556	BYERS	You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
L580633	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
L580629	u8197	m556	MULDER	When was that?
L580628	u8190	m556	BYERS	They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
L580626	u8197	m556	MULDER	Penetration but not perforation.
L580625	u8190	m556	BYERS	You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
L580624	u8197	m556	MULDER	What am I doing here?
L580733	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
L580732	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No, they don't.
L580731	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
L580730	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What is it you find incredible?
L580557	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Agent Mulder.
L580556	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Working with?
L580555	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
L580554	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Nothing completely conclusive --
L580553	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
L580552	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yes. I know.
L580551	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
L580550	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
L580549	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
L580548	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yes.
L580547	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	You've been back to Dallas?
L580545	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Evidence of what?
L580544	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
L580543	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Special Agent Scully --
L580287	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
L580286	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Of what?
L580285	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
L580284	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
L580283	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Incinerate it. Like the others.
L580282	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	And if it's unsuccessful?
L580281	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
L580280	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
L580279	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
L580278	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	How can this be?
L580277	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
L580276	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	This man's still alive.
L580275	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
L580274	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Brought on by what?
L580273	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
L580272	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Yes.
L580271	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	You've got something to show me.
L580449	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Kurtzweil, we think.
L580448	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Who?
L580447	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
L580446	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Do they know?
L580445	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	There are complications.
L580444	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
L580428	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Into what?
L580427	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
L580417	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
L580416	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Who called this meeting?
L580413	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Is it an emergency?
L580412	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	We have a situation. The members are assembling.
L580411	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Yes.
L580331	u8197	m556	MULDER	No. Don't bother.
L580330	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
L580329	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
L580328	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You looking for him for some other reason?
L580327	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
L580326	u8197	m556	MULDER	What's that?
L580325	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
L580324	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Looking for him for what?
L580323	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm looking for him.
L580322	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You got some kind of business with him?
L580321	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
L580398	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	Show you right on a map.
L580397	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
L580386	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	No. Just fossils, far as I know.
L580385	u8197	m556	MULDER	Have you examined them?
L580384	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
L580383	u8197	m556	MULDER	Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
L580382	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
L580381	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
L580581	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
L580580	u8197	m556	MULDER	Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
L580579	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
L580577	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
L580576	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I told you -- he and I were old friends --
L580575	u8197	m556	MULDER	You didn't know my father --
L580574	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I've been using you?!
L580573	u8197	m556	MULDER	You've been using me --
L580572	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Yeah, well I don't have them all.
L580571	u8197	m556	MULDER	You told me you had answers.
L580569	u8197	m556	MULDER	Your guess?
L580568	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	That would be my guess.
L580567	u8197	m556	MULDER	A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
L580566	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What do you think?
L580563	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did it look like?
L580562	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	-- You saw this experiment?
L580561	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm not sure. A virus --
L580560	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What?
L580559	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
L580558	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You found something?
L580363	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You can't.
L580362	u8197	m556	MULDER	How can I reach you?
L580361	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
L580360	u8197	m556	MULDER	And they tell me I'm paranoid.
L580359	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
L580358	u8197	m556	MULDER	Negotiating with whom?
L580357	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
L580356	u8197	m556	MULDER	A plague?
L580355	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
L580354	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'll know soon enough.
L580353	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
L580352	u8197	m556	MULDER	What killed those men?
L580351	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
L580350	u8197	m556	MULDER	What was it?
L580348	u8197	m556	MULDER	Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
L580347	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
L580346	u8197	m556	MULDER	It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
L580345	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
L580344	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
L580343	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
L580342	u8197	m556	MULDER	How?
L580341	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
L580340	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I don't either, but it sure sells books.
L580339	u8197	m556	MULDER	Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
L580338	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You know my work?
L580337	u8197	m556	MULDER	You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
L580336	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
L580335	u8197	m556	MULDER	They want to discredit you -- for what?
L580334	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
L580333	u8197	m556	MULDER	Not according to the men in blue.
L580332	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
L580257	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Do you?
L580256	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think you're full of shit.
L580255	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And one little boy.
L580254	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
L580253	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
L580252	u8197	m556	MULDER	Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
L580251	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	That's what I'm saying.
L580250	u8197	m556	MULDER	Before the bomb went off?
L580249	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Those people were already dead.
L580247	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
L580246	u8197	m556	MULDER	The Federal Building was too well guarded.
L580245	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
L580244	u8197	m556	MULDER	He just let it explode.
L580243	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
L580242	u8197	m556	MULDER	And what's that?
L580240	u8197	m556	MULDER	Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
L580239	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
L580238	u8197	m556	MULDER	Who sent you?
L580237	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
L580236	u8197	m556	MULDER	You a reporter?
L580235	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
L580234	u8197	m556	MULDER	How'd you find me?
L580231	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Old friend of your father's.
L580230	u8197	m556	MULDER	I know the name. Why?
L580229	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
L580228	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Yeah, I did.
L580227	u8197	m556	MULDER	You follow me out here for a reason?
L580226	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
L580225	u8197	m556	MULDER	Do I know you?
L580224	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
L580223	u8197	m556	MULDER	How's that?
L580717	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
L580716	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can't go any farther.
L580714	u8197	m556	MULDER	You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
L580713	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where are we?
L580712	u8197	m556	MULDER	We've got to keep moving.
L580710	u8197	m556	MULDER	Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
L580709	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Cold...
L580608	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
L580607	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully --
L580606	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No -- it's --
L580605	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
L580604	u8198	m556	SCULLY	...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
L580603	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
L580602	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully...
L580600	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think... something stung me.
L580599	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What happened?
L580597	u8197	m556	MULDER	You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
L580596	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
L580594	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
L580593	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need you on this, Scully --
L580592	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
L580591	u8197	m556	MULDER	Just like that --
L580590	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I have. I did. It's done.
L580589	u8197	m556	MULDER	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
L580588	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
L580587	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
L580586	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
L580585	u8197	m556	MULDER	You can't quit, Scully.
L580584	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
L580583	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
L580582	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What's wrong?
L580541	u8197	m556	MULDER	I don't know.
L580540	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where'd they go?
L580534	u8197	m556	MULDER	Come on!
L580533	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What are you doing?
L580532	u8197	m556	MULDER	Run.
L580531	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yeah...?
L580530	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully....?
L580528	u8197	m556	MULDER	Maybe. Maybe not.
L580527	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
L580526	u8197	m556	MULDER	You hear that?
L580524	u8197	m556	MULDER	For the purpose of what?
L580523	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
L580522	u8197	m556	MULDER	Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
L580521	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
L580520	u8197	m556	MULDER	Very weird.
L580519	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is weird, Mulder.
L580518	u8197	m556	MULDER	I have no idea.
L580517	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What do you think it is?
L580516	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
L580515	u8197	m556	MULDER	Been where?
L580514	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
L580513	u8197	m556	MULDER	It may be extraterrestrial.
L580512	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder --
L580511	u8197	m556	MULDER	This virus -- it... 
L580510	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
L580509	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yeah, well they may this one.
L580508	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
L580507	u8197	m556	MULDER	That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
L580506	u8198	m556	SCULLY	-- of what exactly?!
L580505	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
L580504	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
L580503	u8197	m556	MULDER	What?
L580502	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is great. This is fitting.
L580501	u8197	m556	MULDER	Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
L580499	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know why I think they went right.
L580498	u8197	m556	MULDER	You think they went left?
L580497	u8198	m556	SCULLY	We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
L580496	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where would they be going?
L580495	u8198	m556	SCULLY	About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
L580494	u8197	m556	MULDER	What are my choices?
L580493	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
L580492	u8197	m556	MULDER	And where are they going with it?
L580491	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know, Mulder.
L580490	u8197	m556	MULDER	Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
L580472	u8197	m556	MULDER	No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
L580471	u8198	m556	SCULLY	All the equipment is brand new.
L580470	u8197	m556	MULDER	Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
L580469	u8198	m556	SCULLY	It looks pretty green for this climate.
L580468	u8197	m556	MULDER	This looks like new grass to you?
L580467	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
L580466	u8197	m556	MULDER	And you've never seen anything like that?
L580465	u8198	m556	SCULLY	The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
L580464	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
L580463	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
L580462	u8197	m556	MULDER	This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
L580461	u8198	m556	SCULLY	He didn't mention a park.
L580394	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
L580393	u8197	m556	MULDER	How was it contracted?
L580392	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
L580391	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did you find?
L580390	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
L580389	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said you weren't coming?
L580378	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
L580377	u8197	m556	MULDER	-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
L580376	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got a hearing tomorrow --
L580375	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
L580374	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder --
L580373	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
L580372	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know.
L580371	u8197	m556	MULDER	What kind of infection?
L580370	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Evidence of a massive infection.
L580369	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did you find?
L580368	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can't really talk right now.
L580367	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why are you whispering?
L580319	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
L580318	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
L580317	u8197	m556	MULDER	I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
L580316	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
L580315	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'd been told as much.
L580314	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
L580313	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
L580312	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
L580311	u8198	m556	SCULLY	And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
L580310	u8198	m556	SCULLY	There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
L580309	u8197	m556	MULDER	It's like jelly.
L580304	u8198	m556	SCULLY	And you're looking for?
L580303	u8197	m556	MULDER	According to this tag.
L580302	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
L580270	u8197	m556	MULDER	Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
L580269	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- what are you doing?
L580268	u8197	m556	MULDER	Get dressed, Scully.
L580267	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Go home, Mulder. It's late.
L580266	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is that what you'd like me to do?
L580265	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
L580264	u8197	m556	MULDER	What are you implying, Scully?
L580263	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
L580262	u8197	m556	MULDER	I was until about an hour ago.
L580261	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Are you drunk, Mulder?
L580260	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why not? It's three AM.
L580259	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No.
L580258	u8197	m556	MULDER	I wake you?
L580206	u8198	m556	SCULLY	There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
L580205	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're... quitting?
L580204	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
L580203	u8197	m556	MULDER	This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
L580202	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
L580201	u8197	m556	MULDER	They were the ones that put us together.
L580200	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
L580199	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why?
L580198	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
L580197	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What are you talking about?
L580196	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
L580195	u8197	m556	MULDER	They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
L580194	u8198	m556	SCULLY	All I told them was the truth.
L580193	u8197	m556	MULDER	Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
L580164	u8198	m556	SCULLY	-- Mulder! Get in the car!
L580163	u8197	m556	MULDER	Something's not right...
L580148	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
L580147	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully?
L580140	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
L580139	u8197	m556	MULDER	...thirteen fifty six...
L580138	u8197	m556	MULDER	Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
L580137	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
L580134	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Nice try, Mulder.
L580133	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully, get somebody to open this door.
L580131	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm in the vending room.
L580130	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where are you, Mulder?
L580129	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully, I found the bomb.
L580128	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Scully...
L580126	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something sweet.
L580125	u8197	m556	MULDER	Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
L580124	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I just did. You're buying.
L580123	u8197	m556	MULDER	Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
L580122	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
L580121	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Oh yeah. Had you big time.
L580120	u8197	m556	MULDER	No you didn't.
L580119	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Had you.
L580117	u8197	m556	MULDER	It's locked?
L580116	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Now what?
L580115	u8197	m556	MULDER	What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
L580114	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
L580113	u8197	m556	MULDER	How's that?
L580112	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
L580110	u8197	m556	MULDER	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
L580109	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Jesus, Mulder...
L580108	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to playing a hunch?
L580107	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder...?
L580106	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
L580105	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think they have that covered.
L580104	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
L580103	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're looking for a bomb.
L580102	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
L580101	u8197	m556	MULDER	What's wrong, Scully?
L580100	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No. I haven't.
L580099	u8197	m556	MULDER	Did you find something?
L580098	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I'm on the roof.
L580097	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where are you, Scully?
L580096	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- it's me --
L580300	u8197	m556	MULDER	Thank you.
L580299	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
L580297	u8197	m556	MULDER	They can patch you in through the switchboard.
L580296	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	I don't have his number.
L580295	u8197	m556	MULDER	Well, call General McAddie.
L580294	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	I don't know anything about that.
L580293	u8197	m556	MULDER	General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
L580292	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	General McAddie's.
L580291	u8197	m556	MULDER	On whose orders?
L580290	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
L580289	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're going to the morgue.
L580648	u8197	m556	MULDER	I've got to find Scully.
L580647	u8199	m556	SKINNER	What are you doing?
L580644	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I'm not taking any chances.
L580643	u8197	m556	MULDER	Are we being watched?
L580642	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I don't know.
L580641	u8197	m556	MULDER	How deep does this go?
L580640	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
L580639	u8197	m556	MULDER	Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
L580638	u8199	m556	SKINNER	She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
L580637	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where's Scully?!
L580636	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Mulder --
L580191	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
L580190	u8197	m556	MULDER	I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
L580189	u8199	m556	SKINNER	She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
L580188	u8197	m556	MULDER	-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
L580187	u8199	m556	SKINNER	-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
L580186	u8197	m556	MULDER	But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
L580185	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
L580184	u8197	m556	MULDER	And they want to blame us?
L580183	u8199	m556	SKINNER	You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
L580182	u8197	m556	MULDER	She was with me.
L580181	u8199	m556	SKINNER	-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
L580180	u8197	m556	MULDER	About what?
L580179	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
L580701	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My life is over.  Go.
L580700	u8197	m556	MULDER	What about you?
L580699	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
L580698	u8197	m556	MULDER	What alien environment?
L580697	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
L580696	u8197	m556	MULDER	How?
L580695	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
L580692	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Driver.
L580691	u8197	m556	MULDER	Let me out. Stop the car.
L580690	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
L580689	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where is he?
L580688	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
L580687	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to Kurtzweil?
L580686	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
L580685	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why are you telling me this?
L580684	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
L580683	u8197	m556	MULDER	But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
L580682	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
L580681	u8197	m556	MULDER	That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
L580680	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
L580679	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
L580678	u8197	m556	MULDER	What do you mean, walked?
L580677	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
L580676	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
L580675	u8197	m556	MULDER	This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
L580674	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
L580673	u8197	m556	MULDER	A virus?
L580672	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
L580671	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're lying.
L580670	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
L580669	u8197	m556	MULDER	What is it?
L580667	u8197	m556	MULDER	I want to know where Scully is.
L580666	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
L580665	u8197	m556	MULDER	About the conspiracy?
L580664	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
L580663	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Yes.
L580662	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is she alive?
L580661	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I have answers for you.
L580660	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where's Scully?
L580659	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	He's come and gone.
L580658	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to Kurtzweil?
L580657	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Mr. Mulder.
L580459	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
L580458	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	You need not kill a man to destroy him.
L580457	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
L580452	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	And Mulder?
L580451	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
L580450	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
L580443	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
L580442	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Our vaccine may have no effect!
L580439	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
L580438	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
L580437	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
L580436	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
L580435	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
L580432	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
L580431	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
L580430	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My god...
L580424	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
L580423	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	More concerns than that?
L580421	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
L580420	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
L584991	u8211	m558	ANNA	They think you did it.
L584990	u8225	m558	WOMAN	Warscheinlich ist der murder.
L584702	u8225	m558	WOMAN	Das worren nooh zeiten.
L584701	u8211	m558	ANNA	Give her some cigarettes.
L584700	u8225	m558	WOMAN	Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
L584698	u8225	m558	WOMAN	Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
L584697	u8211	m558	ANNA	Ja, ja, ja.
L584696	u8225	m558	WOMAN	Den leuten.
L584630	u8225	m558	WOMAN	Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
L584629	u8211	m558	ANNA	Ich weiss nicht.
L585510	u8211	m558	ANNA	From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
L585509	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...anyway?
L585467	u8211	m558	ANNA	If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
L585466	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...quarrel?
L585454	u8218	m558	MARTINS	We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
L585453	u8211	m558	ANNA	Why are you lying?
L585452	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, well.
L585451	u8211	m558	ANNA	His.
L585450	u8218	m558	MARTINS	That's his headache.
L585449	u8211	m558	ANNA	Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
L585448	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
L585447	u8211	m558	ANNA	There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
L585446	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, the usual things...
L585445	u8211	m558	ANNA	Did he say anything about me - tell me?
L585442	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I saw him today.
L585441	u8211	m558	ANNA	How do you know?
L585440	u8218	m558	MARTINS	He's safe in the Russian zone.
L585439	u8211	m558	ANNA	What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
L585438	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
L585437	u8211	m558	ANNA	I shall be all right.
L585436	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Here, it will be cold on that train.
L585435	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
L585434	u8211	m558	ANNA	What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
L585432	u8211	m558	ANNA	I'm sorry.
L585431	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Harry.
L585427	u8211	m558	ANNA	Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
L585426	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...Headquarters.
L585424	u8211	m558	ANNA	How did you know I would be here?
L585423	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...is there?
L585418	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh...
L585417	u8211	m558	ANNA	Are you going, too?
L585198	u8211	m558	ANNA	There isn't enough for two laughs.
L585197	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...again.
L585185	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
L585184	u8211	m558	ANNA	...and my lover. He was Harry.
L585181	u8211	m558	ANNA	I'll put these flowers in water.
L585180	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
L585179	u8211	m558	ANNA	He liked to laugh.
L585178	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
L585177	u8211	m558	ANNA	He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
L585172	u8211	m558	ANNA	He told you, didn't he?
L585171	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...you know.
L585169	u8211	m558	ANNA	Have you?
L585168	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
L585167	u8211	m558	ANNA	Have you seen Calloway?
L585166	u8218	m558	MARTINS	A parrot...Let it go.
L585165	u8211	m558	ANNA	What happened to your hand?
L585157	u8211	m558	ANNA	Why?
L585156	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I'm going back home.
L585153	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I don't know.
L585152	u8211	m558	ANNA	I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
L585147	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Me.
L585146	u8211	m558	ANNA	Wer ist da?
L585008	u8211	m558	ANNA	Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
L585007	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I wish I knew.
L585006	u8211	m558	ANNA	What are you going to do?
L585005	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
L584966	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Wait here.
L584965	u8211	m558	ANNA	Let's not get into any more trouble.
L584964	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What's the matter?
L584963	u8211	m558	ANNA	Let's go away.
L584962	u8211	m558	ANNA	Yes.
L584961	u8218	m558	MARTINS	That's Harry's place, isn't it?
L584956	u8218	m558	MARTINS	It's all right.
L584955	u8211	m558	ANNA	I'm so sorry.
L584954	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Holly.
L584953	u8211	m558	ANNA	We're both in it, Harry.
L584952	u8218	m558	MARTINS	A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
L584951	u8211	m558	ANNA	I thought you wanted...
L584950	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
L584949	u8211	m558	ANNA	If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
L584948	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well, I didn't learn that from him.
L584947	u8211	m558	ANNA	It's just what he used to say.
L584946	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Seemed like a good idea.
L584941	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Anna.
L584940	u8211	m558	ANNA	...and buried him.
L584930	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
L584929	u8211	m558	ANNA	Tell me more.
L584928	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, that was many years ago.
L584927	u8211	m558	ANNA	Where is she?
L584926	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...to steal my girl.
L584925	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
L584924	u8211	m558	ANNA	When...what did you do?
L584922	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Tell you what?
L584921	u8211	m558	ANNA	Tell me about him.
L584916	u8211	m558	ANNA	Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
L584915	u8218	m558	MARTINS	H-E-Z-T...
L584914	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Ein hurigan - I guess.
L584913	u8211	m558	ANNA	What's that?
L584912	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Gestern bein heurigen...
L584911	u8211	m558	ANNA	Well you read this.
L584910	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Do I...
L584909	u8211	m558	ANNA	Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
L584908	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
L584907	u8211	m558	ANNA	In German?
L584906	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Can I hear you?
L584905	u8211	m558	ANNA	Just another part I've got to learn.
L584904	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
L584903	u8211	m558	ANNA	Need we go through it all again?
L584902	u8218	m558	MARTINS	The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
L584836	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Silly looking bunch.
L584835	u8211	m558	ANNA	Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
L584834	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Who are you looking for now?
L584818	u8211	m558	ANNA	Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
L584817	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Harry?
L584811	u8211	m558	ANNA	Whiskey.
L584810	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Drink?
L584713	u8211	m558	ANNA	Dr. Winkel.
L584712	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
L584693	u8211	m558	ANNA	The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
L584692	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Why?
L584691	u8211	m558	ANNA	They're forged.
L584690	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Anything really wrong with your papers?
L584632	u8211	m558	ANNA	The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
L584631	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What's she talking about?
L584622	u8211	m558	ANNA	Why don't you leave this town - go home?
L584621	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
L584620	u8211	m558	ANNA	You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
L584605	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I was told there were only two men there.
L584604	u8211	m558	ANNA	I don't know. They didn't answer.
L584553	u8211	m558	ANNA	I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
L584552	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...at all.
L584549	u8211	m558	ANNA	Mmmm.
L584548	u8218	m558	MARTINS	He was Harry's driver?
L584547	u8211	m558	ANNA	Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
L584546	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Were you at the inquest?
L584545	u8211	m558	ANNA	Yes.
L584544	u8218	m558	MARTINS	His own doctor?
L584543	u8211	m558	ANNA	The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
L584542	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
L584541	u8211	m558	ANNA	Dr. Winkel told me that.
L584540	u8218	m558	MARTINS	He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
L584539	u8211	m558	ANNA	That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
L584538	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
L584537	u8211	m558	ANNA	Oh, yes, yes.
L584536	u8218	m558	MARTINS	He has a little dog.
L584535	u8211	m558	ANNA	No.
L584534	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
L584533	u8211	m558	ANNA	Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
L584530	u8211	m558	ANNA	I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
L584529	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You were in love with him, weren't you?
L584528	u8211	m558	ANNA	I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
L584527	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well, I saw you at the funeral.
L584517	u8211	m558	ANNA	No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
L584516	u8218	m558	MARTINS	But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
L584515	u8218	m558	MARTINS	No, no...oh...excuse me.
L584514	u8211	m558	ANNA	Do you understand German?
L584513	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You were awfully good.
L584510	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
L584509	u8211	m558	ANNA	Sit down.
L584508	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Thank you.
L584853	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
L584852	u8211	m558	ANNA	Nichts danke. Kein.
L584848	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Keep the packet.
L584847	u8211	m558	ANNA	Thank you.
L584846	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
L584843	u8220	m558	POPESCU	I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
L584842	u8211	m558	ANNA	Of course.
L584841	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
L585293	u8211	m558	ANNA	Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
L585292	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
L585291	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
L585290	u8211	m558	ANNA	I don't know.
L585289	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
L585288	u8211	m558	ANNA	I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
L585287	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	That's what we want to find out.
L585286	u8211	m558	ANNA	Where's Harry?
L585285	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I said another man was buried in his place.
L585284	u8211	m558	ANNA	What did you say? I'm sorry...
L585283	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
L585282	u8211	m558	ANNA	It's true then?
L585281	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
L585280	u8211	m558	ANNA	Two weeks ago.
L585279	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
L584799	u8211	m558	ANNA	What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
L584798	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	You can help us.
L584794	u8211	m558	ANNA	It wasn't important.
L584793	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
L584791	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
L584790	u8211	m558	ANNA	No.
L584789	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	He works in a military hospital.
L584788	u8211	m558	ANNA	No.
L584787	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Joseph Harbin...
L584786	u8211	m558	ANNA	I have never seen him.
L584785	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Do you know this man?
L584784	u8211	m558	ANNA	We loved each other, do you mean that?
L584783	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
L584780	u8211	m558	ANNA	And my passport?
L584779	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
L584671	u8211	m558	ANNA	There's nothing in them.
L584670	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
L584669	u8211	m558	ANNA	You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
L584668	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	That's the reason.
L584667	u8211	m558	ANNA	They're Harry's.
L584666	u8211	m558	ANNA	Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
L584645	u8211	m558	ANNA	Yes.
L584644	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	...parents.
L585416	u8211	m558	ANNA	Good-bye.
L585415	u8219	m558	PAINE	Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
L585414	u8211	m558	ANNA	Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
L585408	u8211	m558	ANNA	I don't...
L585407	u8219	m558	PAINE	Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
L584689	u8219	m558	PAINE	Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
L584688	u8211	m558	ANNA	I don't want it.
L584687	u8219	m558	PAINE	There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
L584660	u8219	m558	PAINE	That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
L584659	u8211	m558	ANNA	They are - private - letters.
L584658	u8219	m558	PAINE	They'll be returned, miss.
L584657	u8211	m558	ANNA	Must you take those?
L584403	u8212	m558	BARON	I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
L584402	u8218	m558	MARTINS	How will I know you?
L584401	u8212	m558	BARON	Just around the corner.
L584400	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Where?
L584399	u8212	m558	BARON	Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
L584398	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
L584397	u8212	m558	BARON	I was a friend of Harry Lime.
L584396	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Yes.
L585141	u8222	m558	RUSSIAN	Can I have that woman's passport?
L585140	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	...Austrian Police Headquarters.
L584778	u8222	m558	RUSSIAN	Thank you.
L584777	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Yes, of course.
L584776	u8222	m558	RUSSIAN	Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
L584775	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	No, not yet.
L584774	u8222	m558	RUSSIAN	We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
L584773	u8222	m558	RUSSIAN	This is forgery. It is very clever.
L584772	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	What is it?
L585561	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
L585560	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Be sensible, Martins.
L585559	u8218	m558	MARTINS	One can't just leave - please.
L585558	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Well, there's not much time.
L585557	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Wait a minute - let me out.
L585556	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
L585555	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
L585553	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Two thirty.
L585552	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	What time is it?
L585493	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
L585492	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Win what?
L585491	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I said you win.
L585490	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
L585489	u8218	m558	MARTINS	All right, Calloway. You win.
L585488	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	"Paine lent me one of your books; ""Oklahoma Kid,"" I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?"
L585483	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
L585482	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Of course.
L585481	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
L585479	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You all did.
L585478	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Didn't I?
L585474	u8218	m558	MARTINS	She's right. It's none of my business.
L585473	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	A girl of spirit.
L585469	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
L585468	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Calloway!
L585389	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
L585388	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
L585387	u8218	m558	MARTINS	It wouldn't work.
L585229	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
L585228	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
L585227	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	How about the doorway?
L585226	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
L585225	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Which side of the road?
L585224	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Fifty yards right down there.
L585223	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
L585222	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
L585221	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	No.
L585220	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I suppose you don't believe me.
L585219	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I see.
L585218	u8218	m558	MARTINS	This is where he vanished.
L585217	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Well?...
L585216	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I followed his shadow until suddenly...
L585138	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Thank you. Excuse me.
L585137	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	...in the morning.
L585133	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I'm not asking you to.
L585132	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	...be responsible for you in the streets.
L585128	u8218	m558	MARTINS	It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
L585127	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	...a week ago.
L585126	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I can't. He disappeared...
L585125	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Bring him in.
L585124	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	So would I.
L585123	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
L585122	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Next, Paine.
L585107	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
L585106	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
L585102	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
L585101	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Do you see what that means?
L585099	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	In Vienna...
L585098	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well?
L585091	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
L585090	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
L585089	u8218	m558	MARTINS	A parrot bit me.
L584715	u8218	m558	MARTINS	A bruised lip.
L584714	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
L584686	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
L584685	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
L584684	u8218	m558	MARTINS	As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
L584683	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Get the next plane.
L584681	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You're not locking her up?
L584680	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Miss Schmidt.
L584665	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Calloway.
L584664	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
L584662	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
L584661	u8218	m558	MARTINS	And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
L584639	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, pinning things on girls now.
L584638	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Getting around, Martins.
L584637	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What the devil?
L584334	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
L584333	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...expense.
L584331	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
L584330	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Listen, Callaghan.
L584323	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Well, you could say that murder was part...
L584322	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
L584319	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	It wasn't petrol.
L584318	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
L584314	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Pin it on a...
L584313	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Ever seen one?
L584312	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
L584307	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	He was...
L584306	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What are you trying to say?
L584305	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	...to him.
L584304	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Best thing that ever happened...
L584303	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Him dying like that.
L584302	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	What?
L584301	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
L584300	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	No.
L584299	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Death at the Double X Ranch - Ra- a-nch.
L584298	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I can't say that I have.
L584297	u8218	m558	MARTINS	"Did you ever hear of ""The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"""
L584296	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	No, sorry.
L584295	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Holly Martins.
L584294	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
L584290	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Once in a while.
L584289	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	See much of him before that?
L584286	u8218	m558	MARTINS	September '39.
L584285	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	When did you see him last?
L584284	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
L584281	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Schmolka!
L584280	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
L584279	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
L584278	u8218	m558	MARTINS	No.
L584277	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Been here long?
L584276	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Yes.
L584275	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	You a friend of Lime's?
L584274	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Martins.
L584273	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	My name is Calloway.
L584255	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Fellow called Lime.
L584254	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Can you tell me whose...
L585499	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	No, no. Leave them for a while.
L585498	u8219	m558	PAINE	Shall I go over there, sir?
L585115	u8219	m558	PAINE	I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
L585114	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	"...of Santa Fe."""
L585110	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
L585109	u8219	m558	PAINE	Very good, sir.
L584655	u8219	m558	PAINE	This way, miss.
L584654	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
L584342	u8219	m558	PAINE	I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
L584341	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	It's a military hotel.
L584339	u8213	m558	CALLOWAY	Take him to Sacher's.
L584338	u8219	m558	PAINE	Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
L585019	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
L585018	u8214	m558	CLERK	I'll look it up for you.
L585017	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...his number.
L585016	u8218	m558	MARTINS	No, I don't know...
L585015	u8214	m558	CLERK	Do you know his number?
L585014	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
L585013	u8214	m558	CLERK	...excuse me.
L585012	u8214	m558	CLERK	Oh, Mr. Martins...
L585011	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
L585052	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
L585051	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Zane Grey.
L585043	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Of course, of course, of course.
L585042	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
L584808	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
L584807	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What's that?
L584806	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
L584805	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What about?
L584804	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
L584490	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
L584489	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
L584411	u8218	m558	MARTINS	It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
L584410	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Seems exciting.
L584406	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Certainly.
L584405	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
L584390	u8218	m558	MARTINS	"Is that what you say to people after death? ""Goodness that's awkward..."""
L584389	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Goodness, that's awkward.
L584388	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
L584387	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
L584386	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Heard of Harry Lime?
L584385	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	No, a major, were you really?
L584384	u8218	m558	MARTINS	It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
L584381	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
L584380	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	I know a very good dentist.
L584379	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Come upstairs a moment.
L584371	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
L584370	u8218	m558	MARTINS	How long can one stay here on this stage money?
L584367	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
L584366	u8218	m558	MARTINS	They wouldn't know me.
L584365	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
L584364	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Welcome?
L584361	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	"Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did ""Hamlet"" and the week before we had something..."
L584360	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You do!
L584376	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Excuse me, have you got tooth...
L584375	u8219	m558	PAINE	...leaving tomorrow, sir.
L584369	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Very popular. Are you staying long?
L584368	u8219	m558	PAINE	Very popular, sir.
L584363	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
L584362	u8219	m558	PAINE	Striptease, sir.
L584358	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
L584357	u8219	m558	PAINE	Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
L584356	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Never heard of him.
L584355	u8219	m558	PAINE	The author. Thought you might be interested.
L584354	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	Who?
L584353	u8219	m558	PAINE	Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
L584352	u8215	m558	CRABBIN	What is it, Sergeant?
L584351	u8219	m558	PAINE	Mr. Crabbin.
L585541	u8216	m558	HARRY	What do you want?
L585540	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...this way.
L585357	u8216	m558	HARRY	Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
L585356	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Have you ever seen any of your victims?
L585353	u8216	m558	HARRY	Sure...
L585352	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
L585351	u8216	m558	HARRY	Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
L585350	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What did you expect me to be - part of your...
L585349	u8216	m558	HARRY	Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
L585348	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You told them, didn't you?
L585346	u8216	m558	HARRY	I wish I could get rid of this thing.
L585345	u8218	m558	MARTINS	As long as they can use you?
L585344	u8216	m558	HARRY	I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
L585343	u8216	m558	HARRY	Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
L585342	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You've got plenty of contacts.
L585341	u8216	m558	HARRY	It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
L585340	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Why not?
L585339	u8216	m558	HARRY	Do you expect me to give myself up?
L585338	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You can get somebody else...
L585337	u8216	m558	HARRY	What do you want me to do?
L585336	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You wouldn't do anything.
L585335	u8216	m558	HARRY	Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
L585334	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
L585333	u8216	m558	HARRY	Did the police believe you?
L585332	u8218	m558	MARTINS	And - Anna...
L585331	u8216	m558	HARRY	Unwise, Holly...
L585330	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I told the police.
L585329	u8216	m558	HARRY	...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
L585328	u8216	m558	HARRY	Holly...
L585327	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You can help her.
L585326	u8216	m558	HARRY	What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
L585324	u8216	m558	HARRY	Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
L585323	u8218	m558	MARTINS	She's been arrested.
L585322	u8216	m558	HARRY	Hmm.
L585318	u8216	m558	HARRY	It's good to see you, Holly.
L585317	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
L585312	u8216	m558	HARRY	Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
L585311	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I want to talk to you.
L585310	u8216	m558	HARRY	Yes.
L585309	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Listen...
L585308	u8216	m558	HARRY	Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
L585307	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Hello, Harry.
L585302	u8218	m558	MARTINS	All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
L585301	u8217	m558	KURTZ	Are you mad?
L584838	u8218	m558	MARTINS	How do you do.
L584837	u8217	m558	KURTZ	Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
L584827	u8217	m558	KURTZ	Yes. The man who helped carry him.
L584826	u8218	m558	MARTINS	The Roumanian?
L584825	u8217	m558	KURTZ	Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
L584822	u8217	m558	KURTZ	But you will.
L584821	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Not yet.
L584478	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What's the name of this girl?
L584477	u8217	m558	KURTZ	...the best way one can, you know.
L584476	u8217	m558	KURTZ	I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
L584475	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...your address?
L584474	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Will you give me...
L584473	u8217	m558	KURTZ	What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
L584472	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
L584469	u8217	m558	KURTZ	Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
L584468	u8218	m558	MARTINS	...you.
L584444	u8217	m558	KURTZ	A Roumanian.
L584443	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
L584441	u8218	m558	MARTINS	But he said he died instantaneously.
L584440	u8217	m558	KURTZ	...you know and all that.
L584438	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What did he say?
L584437	u8217	m558	KURTZ	...were of you.
L584431	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Here?
L584430	u8217	m558	KURTZ	We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
L584420	u8217	m558	KURTZ	At the end of every chapter --
L584419	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You really liked it?
L584418	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
L584417	u8217	m558	KURTZ	It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
L584416	u8217	m558	KURTZ	Zwei zwartze.
L584415	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Coffee.
L584414	u8217	m558	KURTZ	Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
L584760	u8224	m558	WINKEL	Not necessarily.
L584759	u8218	m558	MARTINS	In great pain?
L584758	u8224	m558	WINKEL	...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
L584757	u8224	m558	WINKEL	I understand...
L584756	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Could he have been at all conscious?
L584751	u8224	m558	WINKEL	I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
L584750	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Hear the details.
L584749	u8224	m558	WINKEL	Find out?
L584746	u8224	m558	WINKEL	I have guests waiting.
L584745	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Thank you.
L584744	u8224	m558	WINKEL	Coming to the point, please.
L584743	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Martins.
L584735	u8224	m558	WINKEL	Yes.
L584734	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
L584733	u8224	m558	WINKEL	Vinkel.
L584732	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Dr. Winkel?
L584893	u8221	m558	PORTER	I am not a bad man.
L584892	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Yes, it is.
L584616	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Well make it your business.
L584615	u8221	m558	PORTER	I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
L584614	u8221	m558	PORTER	Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
L584613	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Now, hold on.
L584612	u8221	m558	PORTER	Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
L584610	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Suppose I take...
L584609	u8221	m558	PORTER	Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
L584608	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
L584607	u8221	m558	PORTER	Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
L584606	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You gotta tell your story to the police.
L584594	u8221	m558	PORTER	No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
L584593	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You don't mean that doctor?
L584592	u8221	m558	PORTER	There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
L584591	u8218	m558	MARTINS	And?
L584590	u8221	m558	PORTER	Yes.
L584589	u8218	m558	MARTINS	The Roumanian?
L584588	u8221	m558	PORTER	Yes.
L584587	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Kurtz.
L584585	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Who else?
L584584	u8221	m558	PORTER	...give evidence.
L584574	u8221	m558	PORTER	Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
L584573	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I was told that he did not die at once.
L584572	u8221	m558	PORTER	Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
L584571	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
L584570	u8221	m558	PORTER	Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
L584569	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Could he have been conscious?
L584568	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Why didn't they bring him in the house?
L584567	u8221	m558	PORTER	Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
L584566	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You saw it?
L584565	u8221	m558	PORTER	Happened...Yes happened right down there.
L584563	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What's he saying?
L584562	u8221	m558	PORTER	Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
L584460	u8218	m558	MARTINS	What does he say?
L584459	u8221	m558	PORTER	und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
L584458	u8221	m558	PORTER	...Popescu...
L584453	u8221	m558	PORTER	Yes, yes, I remember you.
L584452	u8218	m558	MARTINS	You remember me? Upstairs...
L584451	u8221	m558	PORTER	Mr. Lime - yes.
L584450	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Did you know Mr. Lime well?
L584449	u8221	m558	PORTER	Yes, sir.
L584448	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Excuse me!
L584395	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Must be some mistake.
L584394	u8221	m558	PORTER	Baron Kurtz.
L584249	u8221	m558	PORTER	Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
L584248	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Coffin?
L584246	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Who?
L584245	u8221	m558	PORTER	Already gone.
L584243	u8221	m558	PORTER	English?
L584242	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Speak English?
L585082	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Never.
L585081	u8220	m558	POPESCU	...Mr. Martins?
L585077	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Why no, Mr. Martins.
L585076	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Should I make it all fact?
L585074	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Yes.
L585073	u8220	m558	POPESCU	...this time.
L585071	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Not when I get interested.
L585070	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Mr. Martins...
L585064	u8220	m558	POPESCU	A novel, Mr. Martins?
L585063	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Third Man.
L584887	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Joseph Harbin? No...no.
L584886	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Joseph Harbin.
L584885	u8220	m558	POPESCU	No.
L584879	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Not necessarily.
L584878	u8218	m558	MARTINS	He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
L584877	u8218	m558	MARTINS	That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
L584876	u8220	m558	POPESCU	What else did he tell you?
L584874	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
L584873	u8218	m558	MARTINS	He didn't want to get involved.
L584872	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
L584864	u8220	m558	POPESCU	What else?
L584863	u8218	m558	MARTINS	That's all you meant?
L584860	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
L584859	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Something wrong.
L584858	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Funny?
L584857	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
L584851	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
L584850	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Harry...
L584845	u8220	m558	POPESCU	Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
L584844	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh, you did.
L584240	u8218	m558	MARTINS	I thought he'd be here to meet me.
L584239	u8223	m558	U.S.M.P.	Okay.
L584238	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Lime.  Harry Lime.
L584237	u8223	m558	U.S.M.P.	His name?
L584236	u8218	m558	MARTINS	With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
L584235	u8223	m558	U.S.M.P.	Where are you staying?
L584234	u8218	m558	MARTINS	A friend of mine offered me a job here.
L584233	u8223	m558	U.S.M.P.	What's the purpose of your visit here?
L584232	u8218	m558	MARTINS	Oh.
L584231	u8223	m558	U.S.M.P.	Passport, please.
L594738	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	You get your money from your husband.
L594737	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	What about me?
L594736	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	"This is for ""mama and the kids."""
L594727	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
L594726	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
L594725	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	I don't know ?-
L594724	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Is he in love with you?
L594723	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Nice fellow?
L594722	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Mmm???yes.
L594721	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Good looking?
L594720	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
L594719	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
L594718	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and ?-
L594717	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Why not -- if you like it ?- if that's what you really want.
L594716	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
L594715	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
L594714	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	That depends. How much money has he?
L594713	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	My son?in?law. What do you think of him?
L594703	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Why not?
L594702	u8279	m563	BRUNTON	Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
L594794	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
L594793	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
L594792	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
L594665	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
L594664	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I don't know.
L594663	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
L594662	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I sleep it off.
L594661	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Then what do you do?
L594660	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	And when you drink, you get drunk.
L594659	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I drink.
L594658	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
L594643	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
L594642	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
L594641	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
L594636	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	It don't look like a leopard to me.
L594635	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
L594875	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's the place: I remember -? My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
L594874	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
L594873	u8285	m563	JERRY	What arroyo -? how did you get to it ??
L594872	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head ?- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ??
L594871	u8285	m563	JERRY	Where? Where did you find it?
L594870	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	What's left of him.
L594869	u8285	m563	JERRY	You found the leopard!
L594868	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
L594679	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
L594678	u8285	m563	JERRY	Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
L594677	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I want him to lock me up.
L594676	u8285	m563	JERRY	What do you want to see him for?
L594675	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I don't know. I want to see Robles.
L594674	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
L594673	u8285	m563	JERRY	Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
L594672	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	I'm sick.
L594667	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
L594666	u8285	m563	JERRY	Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
L594657	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. I'm serious about this.
L594656	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Sure!
L594640	u8285	m563	JERRY	But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
L594639	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Sure, I like my leopards
L594625	u8285	m563	JERRY	Up at the museum.
L594624	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Where's that man?
L594623	u8285	m563	JERRY	Let's get in your truck.
L594622	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Sure.
L594621	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
L594620	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	They don't say it to me.
L594619	u8285	m563	JERRY	They all say the cat killed this second girl.
L594618	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
L594617	u8285	m563	JERRY	You really think so, Charlie?
L594616	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
L594615	u8285	m563	JERRY	Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
L594614	u8280	m563	CHARLIE	Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
L594759	u8287	m563	MARIA	Tomorrow -?
L594758	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	See you tomorrow ?-
L594755	u8287	m563	MARIA	Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
L594754	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	The death card - -
L594753	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Let me see it ??
L594752	u8287	m563	MARIA	Don't look at it!
L594751	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Go on -?
L594750	u8287	m563	MARIA	Something black ?- something on its way to you ??
L594748	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	What are you doing that for?
L594747	u8287	m563	MARIA	Cut.
L594742	u8287	m563	MARIA	The elderly man I told you about.
L594741	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	Who?
L594740	u8287	m563	MARIA	Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
L594469	u8287	m563	MARIA	Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
L594468	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
L594467	u8287	m563	MARIA	You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
L594466	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	What did they say before the bad card came up?
L594464	u8287	m563	MARIA	All men are fools. They like to make a big show -? shout and hunt --
L594463	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
L594462	u8287	m563	MARIA	) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
L594461	u8281	m563	CLO-CLO	I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
L594460	u8287	m563	MARIA	It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -? not the card of four?footed things.
L594559	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too ?? when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret ?? a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
L594558	u8289	m563	ROSITA	Love is different for different people.
L594556	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
L594555	u8289	m563	ROSITA	What, senorita?
L594554	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	Rosita ?? I have wondered -?
L594553	u8289	m563	ROSITA	Pedro is waiting for me, too.
L594539	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	At four. He will be there at four.
L594538	u8289	m563	ROSITA	You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
L594537	u8282	m563	CONSUELO	He will be waiting...
L594811	u8283	m563	ELOISE	I'll miss you too, honey --
L594810	u8286	m563	KIKI	Hey ?? I'm over here.
L594809	u8283	m563	ELOISE	Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ??
L594374	u8286	m563	KIKI	"I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it ""fits just perfect."""
L594373	u8283	m563	ELOISE	And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
L594342	u8286	m563	KIKI	I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
L594341	u8283	m563	ELOISE	I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
L594339	u8286	m563	KIKI	Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
L594338	u8283	m563	ELOISE	You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
L594337	u8286	m563	KIKI	Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ??
L594336	u8283	m563	ELOISE	You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
L594335	u8286	m563	KIKI	Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -? He'll come up with something.
L594334	u8283	m563	ELOISE	She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
L594333	u8286	m563	KIKI	It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click ? click ? click.
L594908	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
L594907	u8283	m563	ELOISE	Oh, that's so interesting!
L594906	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths ?? that's what this procession is supposed to be.
L594905	u8283	m563	ELOISE	You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life ?- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
L594904	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Good evening.
L594903	u8283	m563	ELOISE	Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
L594941	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
L594940	u8285	m563	JERRY	Then you found the leopard --
L594939	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I couldn't rest ?- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
L594938	u8285	m563	JERRY	Tormented -- ? Why?
L594936	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
L594935	u8285	m563	JERRY	Tell me.
L594934	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It's better you don't know.
L594933	u8285	m563	JERRY	Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
L594932	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
L594931	u8285	m563	JERRY	You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
L594930	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Not! I tell you. No!
L594929	u8285	m563	JERRY	It was you.
L594928	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	No.
L594927	u8285	m563	JERRY	It was you, Galbraith!
L594807	u8285	m563	JERRY	You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ??  Don't you?
L594806	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
L594805	u8285	m563	JERRY	Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
L594804	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
L594803	u8285	m563	JERRY	I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
L594802	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	To the eye? Like other men.
L594801	u8285	m563	JERRY	If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
L594800	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
L594799	u8285	m563	JERRY	All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
L594798	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
L594797	u8285	m563	JERRY	You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
L594796	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Just barely possible - - yes.
L594795	u8285	m563	JERRY	You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
L594671	u8285	m563	JERRY	Some other time.
L594670	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
L594669	u8285	m563	JERRY	Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
L594655	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -? eh?
L594654	u8285	m563	JERRY	I don't know.
L594653	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Yes, but what sort of a man?
L594652	u8285	m563	JERRY	A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
L594651	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
L594649	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
L594648	u8285	m563	JERRY	Some crazy guy.
L594647	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
L594646	u8285	m563	JERRY	There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
L594645	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
L594644	u8285	m563	JERRY	It could be a man.
L594638	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Charlie likes his leopard.
L594637	u8285	m563	JERRY	Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
L594634	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yes.
L594633	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	About Charlie's leopard?
L594632	u8285	m563	JERRY	Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
L594631	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
L594630	u8285	m563	JERRY	More or less.
L594629	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Come to look around?
L594628	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	We're old friends.
L594627	u8285	m563	JERRY	You know Charlie How-Come?
L594610	u8285	m563	JERRY	I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
L594609	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
L594604	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
L594603	u8285	m563	JERRY	But it doesn't eat what it kills.
L594602	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
L594601	u8285	m563	JERRY	Why?
L594600	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
L594599	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
L594598	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Sure -- certainly ?- but what's that got to do with this?
L594597	u8285	m563	JERRY	It doesn't jibe with this ?? you told me the leopard would go out into the country ?- it wouldn't stay in the city ??
L594596	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Yes?
L594595	u8285	m563	JERRY	Doc -- something you said the other day --
L594513	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
L594512	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's right, of course.
L594511	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
L594510	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	No. I'm quite sure.
L594509	u8285	m563	JERRY	You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
L594508	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
L594507	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
L594506	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	You're worrying about its killing someone else?
L594505	u8285	m563	JERRY	It's about the leopard.
L594504	u8285	m563	JERRY	I want to ask you something.
L594503	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Well, I'd best be off.
L594494	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	"Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in ""Zaza."" After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out."
L594493	u8285	m563	JERRY	Show business?
L594923	u8286	m563	KIKI	No ?- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -? turn off the lights ??
L594922	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Wait ??
L594916	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	They do, but -- there are no lights out there ?- they'll just be shadows -?
L594915	u8286	m563	KIKI	I thought they came right past here ??
L594914	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
L594911	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ??
L594502	u8286	m563	KIKI	Thanks.
L594501	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
L594500	u8286	m563	KIKI	Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
L594498	u8286	m563	KIKI	That was a calamity!
L594497	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	That was unfortunate.
L594496	u8286	m563	KIKI	Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter ?whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
L594495	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
L594492	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith ? teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
L594491	u8286	m563	KIKI	Why did you give up teaching?
L594490	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
L594489	u8286	m563	KIKI	What do you do now?
L594488	u8284	m563	GALBRAITH	To know where that leopard went - ? I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh?water college back East. I gave that up.
L594487	u8286	m563	KIKI	Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
L594888	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money ? not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
L594887	u8285	m563	JERRY	You won't go to Galbraith with me?
L594886	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
L594885	u8285	m563	JERRY	That's a fact, isn't it?
L594884	u8288	m563	ROBLES	I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
L594883	u8285	m563	JERRY	Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ??
L594881	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'm sure of it!
L594880	u8288	m563	ROBLES	You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
L594879	u8285	m563	JERRY	Chief, don't you understand what this means?
L594789	u8285	m563	JERRY	Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
L594788	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Why?
L594787	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yes. The lipstick.
L594783	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
L594782	u8285	m563	JERRY	State hunters?
L594685	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. He was kidding Charlie.
L594684	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
L594683	u8285	m563	JERRY	I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
L594612	u8285	m563	JERRY	Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
L594611	u8288	m563	ROBLES	What are you getting at?
L594608	u8285	m563	JERRY	I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
L594607	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
L594606	u8285	m563	JERRY	Something's wrong with this whole setup --
L594605	u8288	m563	ROBLES	That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
L594450	u8285	m563	JERRY	It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
L594449	u8288	m563	ROBLES	Go on foot.
L594448	u8285	m563	JERRY	I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
L594445	u8285	m563	JERRY	Thanks, Sheriff.
L594444	u8288	m563	ROBLES	You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
L594954	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
L594953	u8286	m563	KIKI	It's a lovely town ?- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
L594951	u8285	m563	JERRY	We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
L594950	u8286	m563	KIKI	Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -? where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
L594949	u8285	m563	JERRY	"I know. What do you think I felt when you said, ""don't be soft?"""
L594948	u8286	m563	KIKI	I hated you that day ?- you and your flip talk -? with that little girl lying dead.
L594947	u8285	m563	JERRY	I know -- Teresa -?
L594946	u8286	m563	KIKI	We stood here once before.
L594926	u8286	m563	KIKI	It's all right. I'm not hurt.
L594925	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki?
L594890	u8286	m563	KIKI	We will ??
L594889	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
L594863	u8286	m563	KIKI	How do you know?
L594862	u8285	m563	JERRY	Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
L594861	u8286	m563	KIKI	All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways ?
L594860	u8285	m563	JERRY	Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
L594859	u8286	m563	KIKI	I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
L594858	u8285	m563	JERRY	What! You can't be --
L594857	u8286	m563	KIKI	As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
L594856	u8286	m563	KIKI	That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
L594855	u8285	m563	JERRY	I got into a little crap game.
L594854	u8286	m563	KIKI	Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
L594853	u8285	m563	JERRY	Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
L594852	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
L594851	u8286	m563	KIKI	You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
L594848	u8285	m563	JERRY	Absolutely sure.
L594847	u8286	m563	KIKI	You're positive of that, aren't you?
L594846	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
L594845	u8285	m563	JERRY	If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
L594844	u8286	m563	KIKI	Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
L594842	u8286	m563	KIKI	Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
L594841	u8285	m563	JERRY	I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
L594840	u8286	m563	KIKI	You. Us.
L594839	u8285	m563	JERRY	What else do you care about, Kicks?
L594837	u8285	m563	JERRY	That doesn't make sense.
L594836	u8286	m563	KIKI	Maybe I want to feel badly.
L594835	u8285	m563	JERRY	Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
L594832	u8285	m563	JERRY	Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
L594831	u8286	m563	KIKI	And she waited here for him?
L594830	u8286	m563	KIKI	Yes. Do you mind?
L594829	u8285	m563	JERRY	You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
L594828	u8286	m563	KIKI	Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ??
L594826	u8286	m563	KIKI	Yes.
L594825	u8285	m563	JERRY	I know. Funerals.
L594824	u8286	m563	KIKI	Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
L594823	u8285	m563	JERRY	He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
L594822	u8286	m563	KIKI	That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
L594816	u8285	m563	JERRY	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
L594815	u8286	m563	KIKI	I can use them.
L594486	u8286	m563	KIKI	And not a sign of the leopard?
L594483	u8285	m563	JERRY	You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
L594482	u8286	m563	KIKI	Who is he?
L594481	u8285	m563	JERRY	Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
L594480	u8286	m563	KIKI	Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
L594479	u8285	m563	JERRY	The whole town's in a state, Kiki ??doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ??nobody on the streets at night ??
L594478	u8286	m563	KIKI	It must be the altitude ?? you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot?and?saddle boys --
L594477	u8286	m563	KIKI	And did you find the leopard?
L594476	u8285	m563	JERRY	Yeah.
L594475	u8286	m563	KIKI	Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft?soap twenty editors!
L594456	u8285	m563	JERRY	We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
L594455	u8286	m563	KIKI	What did he have to do -? look at the body?
L594454	u8285	m563	JERRY	I don't know ?? a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
L594453	u8286	m563	KIKI	Who was the other man?
L594452	u8286	m563	KIKI	And I suppose you don't feel bad!
L594451	u8285	m563	JERRY	I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
L594442	u8286	m563	KIKI	Don't be soft.
L594441	u8285	m563	JERRY	Suppose I slip them a few bucks ? for the funeral expenses.
L594379	u8286	m563	KIKI	Now look what you've done.
L594378	u8285	m563	JERRY	Are you all right?
L594376	u8286	m563	KIKI	The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
L594375	u8285	m563	JERRY	You look swell in that three?alarm number --
L594371	u8285	m563	JERRY	I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
L594370	u8286	m563	KIKI	Clo-Clo?
L594369	u8285	m563	JERRY	And I never will -- you know what's between us -? we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
L594368	u8286	m563	KIKI	No ?? not yet.
L594367	u8285	m563	JERRY	Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
L594366	u8286	m563	KIKI	This is l939. Can't you subtract?
L594365	u8285	m563	JERRY	Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
L594364	u8286	m563	KIKI	You're too good to me.
L594363	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
L594362	u8286	m563	KIKI	On his back, I suppose.
L594361	u8285	m563	JERRY	I thought -? is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
L594360	u8286	m563	KIKI	That's easy. Me.
L594359	u8285	m563	JERRY	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
L594358	u8286	m563	KIKI	Makes no difference.  Get him out.
L594357	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
L594356	u8286	m563	KIKI	Get it out of here!
L594355	u8285	m563	JERRY	And I never will- you know what's between us ? we're a thing But this is serious competition.
L594354	u8286	m563	KIKI	No ?- not yet.
L594353	u8285	m563	JERRY	Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
L594352	u8286	m563	KIKI	You're too good to me.
L594351	u8285	m563	JERRY	No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
L594350	u8286	m563	KIKI	On his back, I suppose.
L594349	u8285	m563	JERRY	I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ??walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
L594348	u8286	m563	KIKI	That's easy. Me.
L594347	u8285	m563	JERRY	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
L594346	u8286	m563	KIKI	Makes no difference. Get him out!
L594345	u8285	m563	JERRY	Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
L594344	u8286	m563	KIKI	Get it out of here!
L603449	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	We'll see you before you go.
L603448	u8400	m569	NICK	Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
L603447	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	What's your next step, Nick?
L603445	u8400	m569	NICK	Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
L603444	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	What about this Rosebreen?
L603439	u8400	m569	NICK	No.
L603438	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
L602915	u8400	m569	NICK	I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
L602914	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	Come on, gimme a break.
L602913	u8400	m569	NICK	Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
L603021	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Of course.
L603020	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	Is that what it means?
L603019	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Then just say he was sixty years old.
L603018	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	You know how they are... sex...
L603017	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Why not?
L603016	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
L603015	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Yes.  He admitted it.
L603014	u8388	m569	1ST REPORTER	He was?
L603013	u8393	m569	GILBERT	There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
L602665	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He's just around the corner.
L602664	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Any luck?
L602631	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
L602630	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
L602612	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Just a minute...
L602611	u8389	m569	ANDREW	What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
L602610	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
L602609	u8389	m569	ANDREW	He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
L602608	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	But tonight is Christmas Eve!
L602607	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
L602606	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	It's all right.
L602605	u8389	m569	ANDREW	What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
L602602	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I'm sorry.
L602601	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Cheer up, darling.
L602514	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
L602513	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
L602512	u8389	m569	ANDREW	All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
L602504	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
L602503	u8389	m569	ANDREW	I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
L602645	u8400	m569	NICK	You better take a drink.
L602644	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Nothing.
L602643	u8400	m569	NICK	What?
L602642	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Do you suppose.....  ?
L602641	u8400	m569	NICK	Said he stole his invention.
L602640	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Why did that man want to kill him?
L602639	u8400	m569	NICK	Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
L602638	u8389	m569	ANDREW	She's got me worrying, too.
L602468	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
L602467	u8389	m569	ANDREW	Mind if I look around?
L602463	u8406	m569	WYNANT	And if it isn't?
L602462	u8389	m569	ANDREW	That is, if it's all right with you.
L602461	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Well!
L602457	u8389	m569	ANDREW	It's the same one.
L602456	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Another young man.
L602455	u8389	m569	ANDREW	How are you?
L603585	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Oh, Andy, Andy!
L603584	u8390	m569	ANDY	Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
L603516	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Why not?
L603515	u8390	m569	ANDY	You're high enough.
L603514	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
L603327	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Go away!
L603326	u8390	m569	ANDY	Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
L603325	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
L603324	u8390	m569	ANDY	You're talking like a crazy person,
L603323	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
L603322	u8390	m569	ANDY	Dorothy!
L603321	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
L603320	u8390	m569	ANDY	I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
L603319	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
L603318	u8390	m569	ANDY	Do you think I care
L603317	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
L603316	u8390	m569	ANDY	What are you talking about?
L603315	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	And don't ever try to see me again.
L603314	u8390	m569	ANDY	Go!
L603313	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
L603312	u8390	m569	ANDY	You've got to get your mind off this.
L603311	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I can't.
L603310	u8390	m569	ANDY	Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
L603309	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I can't help it.  You don't know.....
L603308	u8390	m569	ANDY	Don't cry.
L603307	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Oh, Andy.
L603305	u8398	m569	MIMI	And I'll give then proof!
L603304	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Mother!
L602876	u8398	m569	MIMI	Now do you believe me!
L602875	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Oh!
L602874	u8398	m569	MIMI	There!
L602873	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I don't believe it! You're lying!
L602872	u8398	m569	MIMI	I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
L602871	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	All right, then.  I'll tell them.
L602870	u8398	m569	MIMI	I'll do nothing of the sort.
L602869	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You hand that over to the police.
L602868	u8398	m569	MIMI	It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
L602867	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Then what are you hiding?
L602866	u8398	m569	MIMI	I didn't.
L602865	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You took that money from Julia's hand.
L602832	u8398	m569	MIMI	Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
L602831	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Don't.  It's horrible.
L602743	u8398	m569	MIMI	Shush!
L602742	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
L602741	u8398	m569	MIMI	I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
L602740	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
L602732	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
L602731	u8398	m569	MIMI	That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
L602730	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
L602729	u8398	m569	MIMI	No.
L602728	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
L602727	u8398	m569	MIMI	That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
L602726	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Nothing.
L602725	u8398	m569	MIMI	What is it?
L602724	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
L602723	u8398	m569	MIMI	What is it? Has he found him?
L602720	u8398	m569	MIMI	Oh, here she is.
L602719	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Give it to me.
L602718	u8398	m569	MIMI	How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
L603568	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	What do you mean?
L603567	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He didn't do it -- Nick!
L602523	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
L602522	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He wouldn't say.
L602521	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Did he tell you where he was going?
L602520	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He's waiting for you.
L602519	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Is your father still in there?
L602518	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
L602517	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
L603583	u8400	m569	NICK	He's been dead for three months.
L603582	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Dead?
L603505	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
L603504	u8400	m569	NICK	Hello, Dorothy. 
L602964	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	That's the truth.
L602963	u8400	m569	NICK	Don't lie to me.
L602962	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I bought it in a pawn shop.
L602961	u8400	m569	NICK	Where did you get this gun?
L602960	u8400	m569	NICK	Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
L602959	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	She... she fell over backwards.
L602958	u8400	m569	NICK	Which way did she fall?
L602957	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I don't know.
L602956	u8400	m569	NICK	Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
L602955	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	She fell down.
L602954	u8400	m569	NICK	Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
L602953	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Why... in the heart.
L602952	u8400	m569	NICK	Where did you hit her?
L602951	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
L602950	u8400	m569	NICK	What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
L602949	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	There. 
L602948	u8400	m569	NICK	Yes.
L602947	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You heard about Julia Wolf?
L602940	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I've got to see you alone!
L602939	u8400	m569	NICK	Come on in.
L602722	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Oh, thank heaven.
L602721	u8400	m569	NICK	I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
L602671	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
L602670	u8400	m569	NICK	We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
L602669	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
L602667	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
L602666	u8400	m569	NICK	Your father?
L602636	u8400	m569	NICK	Why don't you try him again?
L602635	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	tried him once -
L602634	u8400	m569	NICK	That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
L602633	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Macaulay.
L602632	u8400	m569	NICK	I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
L602629	u8400	m569	NICK	Disappeared!
L602628	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
L602627	u8400	m569	NICK	Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
L602626	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
L602625	u8400	m569	NICK	Probably not.
L602624	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
L602623	u8400	m569	NICK	How did you ever remember me?
L602622	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Yes.
L602621	u8400	m569	NICK	Not that scrawny little....? 
L602620	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
L602619	u8400	m569	NICK	Yes.
L602618	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Aren't you Nick Charles?
L602617	u8400	m569	NICK	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
L602616	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You know, we know each other.
L602614	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Hello, there!
L602613	u8400	m569	NICK	Another Martini --
L602510	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
L602509	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
L602508	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Better get home before it is.
L602507	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	But it isn't bad weather now.
L602506	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Only in bad weather.
L602505	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
L602502	u8406	m569	WYNANT	He's a brave man.
L602501	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	And he still wants to marry me!
L602500	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
L602499	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
L602498	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I know -- I know --
L602497	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
L602496	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
L602495	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He's all right.
L602494	u8406	m569	WYNANT	How's your brother?
L602493	u8406	m569	WYNANT	That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
L602492	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	It's a promise?
L602491	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
L602490	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
L602489	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
L602488	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	A new invention?
L602487	u8406	m569	WYNANT	It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
L602486	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Where are you going?
L602485	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
L602484	u8406	m569	WYNANT	If you think it'll be all right.
L602483	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
L602482	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
L602481	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	This is my wedding.
L602480	u8406	m569	WYNANT	What would your mother say to that?
L602479	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
L602478	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Yes, she would.
L602477	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
L602466	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
L602465	u8406	m569	WYNANT	You see how much we have to say.
L602464	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	He'll still be your son-in-law!
L602460	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
L602459	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Forgive me.  How are you?
L602458	u8391	m569	DOROTHY	It's been the same one for three months.
L603434	u8400	m569	NICK	Yes... yes.
L603433	u8392	m569	DR. WALTON	Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
L603432	u8400	m569	NICK	Shrapnel!
L603423	u8400	m569	NICK	I'm very interested in that body.
L603422	u8392	m569	DR. WALTON	Not at all.
L603421	u8400	m569	NICK	Do you mind if I come down and see it?
L603420	u8392	m569	DR. WALTON	Yes.
L603419	u8400	m569	NICK	Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
L603418	u8392	m569	DR. WALTON	You can take that out to the car.
L603558	u8393	m569	GILBERT	know.  But I saw him -
L603557	u8398	m569	MIMI	What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
L603556	u8393	m569	GILBERT	I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
L602840	u8398	m569	MIMI	Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
L602839	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
L602836	u8398	m569	MIMI	I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
L602835	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
L602834	u8398	m569	MIMI	Gilbert!
L602833	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Did you kill her?
L602830	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Was there much blood?
L602829	u8398	m569	MIMI	Not a thing.
L602828	u8393	m569	GILBERT	Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
L602739	u8393	m569	GILBERT	She could tell you where father is.
L602738	u8398	m569	MIMI	That woman!
L602737	u8393	m569	GILBERT	He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
L602736	u8398	m569	MIMI	What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
L603618	u8400	m569	NICK	You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
L603617	u8394	m569	GUILD	Shut up.
L603594	u8400	m569	NICK	--was Wynant's.
L603593	u8394	m569	GUILD	You mean that body-----?
L603566	u8400	m569	NICK	Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
L603565	u8394	m569	GUILD	Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
L603564	u8400	m569	NICK	No.
L603563	u8394	m569	GUILD	Are you kidding?
L603426	u8400	m569	NICK	I'll take care of him.
L603425	u8394	m569	GUILD	What're you doing here?
L603414	u8394	m569	GUILD	Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
L603413	u8400	m569	NICK	Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
L603412	u8394	m569	GUILD	He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
L603411	u8400	m569	NICK	I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
L603410	u8394	m569	GUILD	Could this be him?

L603400	u8394	m569	GUILD	Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
L603399	u8400	m569	NICK	Just rolled them up and threw them in.
L603337	u8394	m569	GUILD	This is enough for me.
L603336	u8400	m569	NICK	Fifty will still get you a hundred.
L603335	u8394	m569	GUILD	I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
L603331	u8400	m569	NICK	She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
L603330	u8394	m569	GUILD	Get anything?
L603280	u8400	m569	NICK	Nunheim!
L603279	u8394	m569	GUILD	Trail him!  Trail who?
L603278	u8400	m569	NICK	I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
L603277	u8394	m569	GUILD	Who're you calling?
L603276	u8400	m569	NICK	I think we're on the right track.
L603275	u8394	m569	GUILD	Well, what'd you think?
L603243	u8394	m569	GUILD	Let's go and see.  Taxi!
L603242	u8400	m569	NICK	He's holding out on you.
L603241	u8394	m569	GUILD	No.
L603240	u8400	m569	NICK	Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
L603239	u8394	m569	GUILD	Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
L603238	u8400	m569	NICK	What about this Nunheim?
L603236	u8394	m569	GUILD	I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
L603235	u8400	m569	NICK	What about Jorgensen?
L603234	u8394	m569	GUILD	They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
L603233	u8400	m569	NICK	I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
L603232	u8394	m569	GUILD	Who's your candidate?
L603231	u8400	m569	NICK	For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
L603230	u8394	m569	GUILD	What do you mean?
L603229	u8400	m569	NICK	Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
L603228	u8394	m569	GUILD	Nothing yet to cinch it.
L603227	u8400	m569	NICK	No proof?
L603226	u8394	m569	GUILD	Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
L603225	u8400	m569	NICK	You've been there?
L603222	u8400	m569	NICK	I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
L603221	u8394	m569	GUILD	Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
L603220	u8400	m569	NICK	What about the suicide?
L603219	u8394	m569	GUILD	It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
L603218	u8400	m569	NICK	So would I.
L603215	u8400	m569	NICK	Man to man, I'm not.
L603214	u8394	m569	GUILD	Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
L603213	u8394	m569	GUILD	That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
L603212	u8400	m569	NICK	You mean about that gun?
L603211	u8394	m569	GUILD	You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
L603134	u8394	m569	GUILD	Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.

L603108	u8394	m569	GUILD	We were looking for this bird.
L603107	u8400	m569	NICK	Yes.  I might not have been shot.
L603106	u8394	m569	GUILD	We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.

L602821	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	I didn't know they had a fight.
L602820	u8394	m569	GUILD	Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
L602819	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
L602815	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Yes.  But he didn't show up.
L602814	u8394	m569	GUILD	Did you go?
L602813	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	About three.
L602812	u8394	m569	GUILD	When was that?
L602811	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
L602810	u8394	m569	GUILD	He did!
L602809	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	He telephoned me today.
L602808	u8394	m569	GUILD	Well, what?
L602807	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Well....
L602806	u8394	m569	GUILD	Oh, then you did hear from him?
L602805	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	I said he hadn't written me.
L602799	u8394	m569	GUILD	Seen any signs of it, Bill?
L602798	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
L602797	u8394	m569	GUILD	When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
L603572	u8394	m569	GUILD	Let him have his say out.
L603571	u8398	m569	MIMI	That's ridiculous.
L603555	u8394	m569	GUILD	Tell 'em.
L603554	u8398	m569	MIMI	A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
L603553	u8394	m569	GUILD	What kind of clothes was he wearing?
L603548	u8398	m569	MIMI	That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
L603547	u8394	m569	GUILD	You did!
L602858	u8394	m569	GUILD	Goodbye.
L602857	u8398	m569	MIMI	Goodbye.
L602856	u8394	m569	GUILD	That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
L602853	u8394	m569	GUILD	The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
L602852	u8398	m569	MIMI	I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
L602851	u8394	m569	GUILD	Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
L602850	u8398	m569	MIMI	No.
L602849	u8394	m569	GUILD	Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
L602848	u8398	m569	MIMI	Why yes.
L602847	u8394	m569	GUILD	You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
L602846	u8398	m569	MIMI	I see.
L602845	u8394	m569	GUILD	There are a few things we want to check up on.
L603529	u8401	m569	NORA	You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
L603528	u8394	m569	GUILD	They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
L603527	u8401	m569	NORA	Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
L603526	u8394	m569	GUILD	I guess all the suspects are here.
L603525	u8401	m569	NORA	I think we may as well sit down.
L603224	u8394	m569	GUILD	Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
L603223	u8401	m569	NORA	Do you think that Wynant did it?
L603217	u8394	m569	GUILD	I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
L603216	u8401	m569	NORA	But he's interested!
L603210	u8401	m569	NORA	Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
L603209	u8394	m569	GUILD	Good morning --
L603274	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
L603273	u8394	m569	GUILD	How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
L603272	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
L603271	u8394	m569	GUILD	Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
L603270	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
L603269	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
L603268	u8394	m569	GUILD	Where were you?
L603265	u8394	m569	GUILD	Where were you?
L603264	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	You don't think I had anything to do with it?
L603263	u8394	m569	GUILD	You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
L603260	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	I didn't mean you, Mister.
L603259	u8394	m569	GUILD	Want to take a poke at him?
L603258	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
L603257	u8394	m569	GUILD	Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
L603256	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
L603253	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
L603252	u8394	m569	GUILD	What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
L603251	u8402	m569	NUNHEIM	Have a shot?
L602827	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	Never mind.
L602826	u8398	m569	MIMI	Why, you said...
L602825	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	I thought you said you weren't going there.
L602824	u8398	m569	MIMI	and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
L602764	u8398	m569	MIMI	Chris -- Chris -- !
L602763	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
L602762	u8398	m569	MIMI	You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
L602761	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	Just what I said I'd do.
L602760	u8398	m569	MIMI	What are you going to do?
L602759	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	I said all right!
L602758	u8398	m569	MIMI	I couldn't go near that woman.
L602757	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	All right.  All right.
L602756	u8398	m569	MIMI	Chris!
L602755	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
L602754	u8398	m569	MIMI	I know.
L602753	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	You've said that for weeks.
L602752	u8398	m569	MIMI	I'll get some.
L602751	u8395	m569	JORGENSEN	How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
L602750	u8398	m569	MIMI	Don't mind what she says, Chris.
L602597	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
L602596	u8396	m569	JULIA	I never had it.
L602595	u8406	m569	WYNANT	What did you do with the rest?
L602594	u8396	m569	JULIA	I can't! I haven't got it!
L602593	u8406	m569	WYNANT	You're going to return every cent of it!
L602592	u8396	m569	JULIA	I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
L602591	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
L602590	u8396	m569	JULIA	That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
L602589	u8406	m569	WYNANT	They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
L602588	u8396	m569	JULIA	Go ahead!
L602587	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
L602586	u8396	m569	JULIA	supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
L602585	u8406	m569	WYNANT	That's my business.
L602584	u8396	m569	JULIA	What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
L602583	u8406	m569	WYNANT	No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
L602582	u8396	m569	JULIA	Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
L602581	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
L602580	u8396	m569	JULIA	Don't you remember....
L602579	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
L602578	u8396	m569	JULIA	Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
L602577	u8406	m569	WYNANT	The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
L602576	u8396	m569	JULIA	What bonds?
L602575	u8406	m569	WYNANT	No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
L602574	u8396	m569	JULIA	Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
L602573	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I don't like him.
L602572	u8396	m569	JULIA	This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
L602571	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
L602570	u8396	m569	JULIA	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
L602569	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Who's that man?
L602566	u8406	m569	WYNANT	So I see.
L602565	u8396	m569	JULIA	We're just having a little drink.
L603187	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
L603186	u8401	m569	NORA	Oh, please, Nick.
L603183	u8401	m569	NORA	So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
L603182	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	I got word from Wynant this morning...
L603178	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	That's all right.
L603177	u8401	m569	NORA	Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
L603172	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Good.
L603171	u8401	m569	NORA	Oh, he's sitting up.
L603170	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	"Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very ""Merry Christmas"" for you."
L603169	u8401	m569	NORA	Oh, hello.  Come on in.
L602709	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Yes?
L602708	u8401	m569	NORA	Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
L602546	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
L602545	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	But what if you need more money?
L602544	u8406	m569	WYNANT	No.
L602543	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Is Julia going with you?
L602542	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
L602541	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	What'll I do if something comes up?
L602540	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Thanks, and goodbye.
L602539	u8406	m569	WYNANT	You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
L602538	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Well, let me do that for you.
L602537	u8406	m569	WYNANT	No.
L602536	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
L602535	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I trust you.

L602533	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Never mind.
L602532	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	One hundred...  two hundred... three...
L602531	u8406	m569	WYNANT	That's just why I'm going.
L602530	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	But suppose some business comes up...
L602529	u8406	m569	WYNANT	I'm not telling anyone.
L602528	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
L602527	u8406	m569	WYNANT	Did you get my money?
L603626	u8400	m569	NICK	What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
L603625	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	I have no right to answer that.
L603608	u8400	m569	NICK	Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
L603607	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
L603193	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
L603192	u8400	m569	NICK	Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?

L602690	u8397	m569	MACAULAY	How are you?
L603624	u8400	m569	NICK	Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
L603623	u8398	m569	MIMI	I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
L603622	u8400	m569	NICK	You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
L603621	u8398	m569	MIMI	It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
L603620	u8400	m569	NICK	What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?

L603591	u8398	m569	MIMI	Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
L603552	u8398	m569	MIMI	He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
L603551	u8400	m569	NICK	Oh, did he?  What did he say?
L603550	u8398	m569	MIMI	Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.

L603302	u8400	m569	NICK	They'll want more than your word for that.
L603301	u8398	m569	MIMI	I tell you -- he didn't do it.
L603300	u8400	m569	NICK	That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
L603299	u8398	m569	MIMI	But he has nothing to do with it!
L603298	u8400	m569	NICK	You should have told them he'd disappeared.

L602992	u8398	m569	MIMI	Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.

L603577	u8400	m569	NICK	Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
L603576	u8399	m569	MORELLI	Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
L603575	u8400	m569	NICK	Why do you say that?
L603574	u8399	m569	MORELLI	She don't say she is, but I figure she is -

L603083	u8400	m569	NICK	I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
L603082	u8399	m569	MORELLI	That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
L603081	u8400	m569	NICK	I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
L603080	u8399	m569	MORELLI	He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
L603079	u8400	m569	NICK	How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
L603078	u8399	m569	MORELLI	"Listen.  ""Studsy"" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they...."
L603077	u8400	m569	NICK	That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
L603076	u8399	m569	MORELLI	I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
L603075	u8400	m569	NICK	Why tell me?
L603074	u8399	m569	MORELLI	I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.

L603614	u8400	m569	NICK	His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
L603613	u8401	m569	NORA	I hope you're well.
L603612	u8400	m569	NICK	It's the only way it makes sense.

L603609	u8401	m569	NORA	Is that true?
L603606	u8400	m569	NICK	After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
L603605	u8401	m569	NORA	If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
L603581	u8400	m569	NICK	Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
L603580	u8401	m569	NORA	You're going to drive me crazy!
L603562	u8400	m569	NICK	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.

L603469	u8400	m569	NICK	Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.

L603463	u8400	m569	NICK	That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.

L612175	u8414	m571	LUH	You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
L612174	u8419	m571	THX	You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
L612173	u8414	m571	LUH	No....I though  I'm afraid.
L612172	u8419	m571	THX	What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
L612171	u8414	m571	LUH	Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
L612170	u8419	m571	THX	I'll try.
L612169	u8414	m571	LUH	Don't take anything.
L612168	u8419	m571	THX	They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
L612167	u8414	m571	LUH	No!  Don't go.
L612166	u8419	m571	THX	Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
L612165	u8414	m571	LUH	It's 3+27 hundred
L612164	u8419	m571	THX	I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
L612163	u8414	m571	LUH	What?
L612162	u8419	m571	THX	What time is it?
L612161	u8419	m571	THX	But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
L612160	u8414	m571	LUH	I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
L612159	u8414	m571	LUH	What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
L612158	u8419	m571	THX	Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
L612151	u8419	m571	THX	Looks like food.
L612150	u8414	m571	LUH	That's not food.  Can't be food.
L612149	u8419	m571	THX	Look, food!
L612148	u8414	m571	LUH	Looks like dirt.
L612147	u8419	m571	THX	That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
L612146	u8414	m571	LUH	Look,dirt!
L612145	u8419	m571	THX	I've never been under the table before.
L612094	u8414	m571	LUH	Don't be so sure.
L612093	u8419	m571	THX	I haven't done anything.
L612092	u8414	m571	LUH	I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
L612091	u8419	m571	THX	Then why did you bring it up?
L612090	u8414	m571	LUH	No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
L612089	u8419	m571	THX	You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
L612088	u8414	m571	LUH	I have to... he's a G-34
L612087	u8419	m571	THX	Don't go.
L612086	u8414	m571	LUH	I don't know.
L612085	u8419	m571	THX	A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
L612084	u8414	m571	LUH	He wants me to come to his quarters.
L612083	u8419	m571	THX	Now?
L612082	u8414	m571	LUH	Now.
L612081	u8419	m571	THX	When?
L612080	u8414	m571	LUH	I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
L612079	u8419	m571	THX	What did you get?
L612044	u8414	m571	LUH	Eat your dinner.
L612043	u8419	m571	THX	You know I don't feel well.
L612042	u8414	m571	LUH	You've seen enough.
L612041	u8419	m571	THX	What's this?  Why did you change it?
L612037	u8419	m571	THX	What's the matter with you?
L612036	u8414	m571	LUH	No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
L612035	u8414	m571	LUH	Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
L612034	u8419	m571	THX	I'm not hungry.
L612449	u8416	m571	PTO	It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
L612448	u8415	m571	NIN	There goes another of your disciples.
L612420	u8416	m571	PTO	A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
L612419	u8415	m571	NIN	Good Lord!
L612416	u8416	m571	PTO	What?
L612415	u8415	m571	NIN	But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
L612326	u8415	m571	NIN	What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
L612325	u8416	m571	PTO	You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
L612320	u8415	m571	NIN	I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
L612319	u8416	m571	PTO	Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
L612469	u8415	m571	NIN	But you can't.  We must escape.
L612468	u8417	m571	SEN	THX and me.
L612467	u8415	m571	NIN	Who?  Who's leaving?
L612466	u8417	m571	SEN	We're leaving.
L612465	u8415	m571	NIN	What?
L612464	u8417	m571	SEN	We're leaving.
L612463	u8415	m571	NIN	What's going on....what are you doing?
L612411	u8415	m571	NIN	We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
L612410	u8417	m571	SEN	I thought you were through with it!
L612473	u8420	m571	TWA	Incredible!
L612472	u8415	m571	NIN	We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
L612446	u8420	m571	TWA	It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
L612445	u8415	m571	NIN	That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
L612401	u8420	m571	TWA	Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
L612400	u8415	m571	NIN	Wait!  I'll talk to him.
L612394	u8420	m571	TWA	I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
L612393	u8415	m571	NIN	He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
L612385	u8420	m571	TWA	Impossible!
L612384	u8415	m571	NIN	I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
L612444	u8420	m571	TWA	No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
L612443	u8416	m571	PTO	What?
L612442	u8420	m571	TWA	I've got it!  Astounding!
L612432	u8420	m571	TWA	On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
L612431	u8416	m571	PTO	Not very encouraging.
L612430	u8420	m571	TWA	Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
L612429	u8416	m571	PTO	Well?
L612399	u8416	m571	PTO	You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
L612398	u8420	m571	TWA	How far did you go?  Was it cold?
L612388	u8420	m571	TWA	No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
L612387	u8416	m571	PTO	I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
L612481	u8419	m571	THX	Look!
L612480	u8417	m571	SEN	What?
L612461	u8417	m571	SEN	But you can't...you.
L612460	u8419	m571	THX	Right now.

L612458	u8419	m571	THX	I'm leaving.

L612211	u8417	m571	SEN	You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
L612210	u8419	m571	THX	What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
L612131	u8419	m571	THX	I don't feel well.
L612130	u8417	m571	SEN	I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
L612128	u8417	m571	SEN	Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
L612127	u8419	m571	THX	You're in violation.
L612126	u8417	m571	SEN	We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
L612125	u8419	m571	THX	I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
L612124	u8417	m571	SEN	It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
L612123	u8419	m571	THX	Where's LUH?
L612122	u8417	m571	SEN	I want you for my roommate.
L612121	u8419	m571	THX	What's going on?
L612120	u8417	m571	SEN	Why are you so concerned?
L612119	u8419	m571	THX	Why did you have LUH come here?
L612114	u8417	m571	SEN	What?
L612113	u8419	m571	THX	Where is LUH?
L612112	u8417	m571	SEN	I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
L612638	u8419	m571	THX	I thought of something.....
L612637	u8418	m571	SRT	Just look at all those people.

L616032	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Baloney!
L616031	u8465	m575	ANYA	I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
L616030	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Will you leave me alone?
L616029	u8465	m575	ANYA	And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
L616028	u8470	m575	LOTHER	--and I can tell you where to get off.
L616027	u8465	m575	ANYA	Oh--a hundred times--
L616026	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I didn't ask you to come away with me--
L616025	u8465	m575	ANYA	Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
L616024	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
L616023	u8465	m575	ANYA	Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
L616022	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
L616021	u8465	m575	ANYA	Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
L616017	u8465	m575	ANYA	Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
L616016	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I can explain--
L616015	u8465	m575	ANYA	So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.

L616004	u8470	m575	LOTHER	This is Miss Marsh.
L616003	u8465	m575	ANYA	Hope we're not intruding.
L615889	u8465	m575	ANYA	I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
L615888	u8470	m575	LOTHER	But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
L615661	u8465	m575	ANYA	That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
L615660	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
L615659	u8465	m575	ANYA	Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
L615658	u8465	m575	ANYA	I never want to go back....
L615657	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Sure!
L615656	u8465	m575	ANYA	When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
L615655	u8470	m575	LOTHER	How'd you ever get away with it?
L615654	u8465	m575	ANYA	You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
L615653	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
L615652	u8465	m575	ANYA	It would be a nice change from you.
L615651	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Do you want the truth, Anya?
L615650	u8465	m575	ANYA	Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
L615649	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
L615648	u8465	m575	ANYA	Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
L615647	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Anya, I think you're crazy.
L615640	u8465	m575	ANYA	Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
L615639	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Anya!
L616287	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
L616286	u8465	m575	ANYA	No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
L616132	u8465	m575	ANYA	Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
L616131	u8467	m575	BRETT	Isn't she lovely?
L616093	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thanks.
L616092	u8465	m575	ANYA	We'll save you a place at our table.
L616091	u8467	m575	BRETT	Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
L615891	u8465	m575	ANYA	That's a date. 
L615890	u8467	m575	BRETT	I hope so.
L615886	u8467	m575	BRETT	Glad to see you again.
L615885	u8465	m575	ANYA	Good afternoon--
L615821	u8465	m575	ANYA	Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
L615820	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
L615817	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
L615816	u8465	m575	ANYA	Feeling a little better, I see.
L615689	u8465	m575	ANYA	I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
L615688	u8467	m575	BRETT	I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
L616013	u8475	m575	SALLY	I think you do.
L616012	u8465	m575	ANYA	I don't understand.
L616011	u8475	m575	SALLY	You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
L616010	u8465	m575	ANYA	Sorry I can't return the compliment.
L616009	u8475	m575	SALLY	You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
L615819	u8465	m575	ANYA	Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
L615818	u8475	m575	SALLY	How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
L616189	u8465	m575	ANYA	Where's Lother?
L616188	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	No-o!
L616187	u8465	m575	ANYA	No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
L616186	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Did you find it?
L616148	u8465	m575	ANYA	I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
L616147	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
L616019	u8465	m575	ANYA	<U>Gladly</U>.
L616018	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Will you pardon me?
L615893	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
L615892	u8465	m575	ANYA	You'll excuse me. 
L615879	u8465	m575	ANYA	Isn't that interesting?
L615878	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
L615672	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	"Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--""Honest Jack""--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world."
L615671	u8465	m575	ANYA	Montana?
L615670	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
L616450	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Get moving--
L616449	u8466	m575	BALLINGER	Guess again, copper.
L616448	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
L616447	u8466	m575	BALLINGER	Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
L616446	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	What did you want a gun for?
L616445	u8466	m575	BALLINGER	Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
L616444	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Where'd you get it?
L616377	u8467	m575	BRETT	"I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --""Honest Jack""! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets."
L616376	u8470	m575	LOTHER	And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
L616373	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
L616372	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
L616371	u8470	m575	LOTHER	In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
L616368	u8467	m575	BRETT	I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
L616367	u8470	m575	LOTHER	No gentleman would do that.
L616352	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure!  Excuse me.
L616351	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Could I see you a minute?
L616088	u8467	m575	BRETT	Fine--I'll be glad to.
L616087	u8470	m575	LOTHER	How about a little game later?
L615925	u8467	m575	BRETT	That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
L615924	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You're coming back--
L615915	u8470	m575	LOTHER	And me coming in with two pair-- 
L615914	u8467	m575	BRETT	Aces full.
L615911	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll bet a couple of hundred.
L615910	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
L615903	u8470	m575	LOTHER	If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
L615902	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
L615897	u8467	m575	BRETT	Not at all.
L615896	u8470	m575	LOTHER	We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
L615693	u8470	m575	LOTHER	We'll be expecting you.
L615692	u8467	m575	BRETT	Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
L616523	u8475	m575	SALLY	What's the matter?
L616522	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, I'll be--!!!
L616521	u8475	m575	SALLY	Jimmy!
L616520	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
L616425	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll be waiting on deck.
L616424	u8475	m575	SALLY	Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
L616423	u8467	m575	BRETT	Make it five.
L616422	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
L616309	u8467	m575	BRETT	Come on--let's take a swim.
L616308	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
L616307	u8467	m575	BRETT	You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
L616306	u8475	m575	SALLY	He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
L616305	u8467	m575	BRETT	You can live that down, can't you?
L616304	u8475	m575	SALLY	Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
L616303	u8467	m575	BRETT	What do you know about them?
L616302	u8475	m575	SALLY	That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
L616301	u8467	m575	BRETT	Lose?--I won a little--
L616300	u8475	m575	SALLY	Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
L616299	u8467	m575	BRETT	A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
L616298	u8475	m575	SALLY	Who with?
L616297	u8467	m575	BRETT	Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
L616296	u8475	m575	SALLY	How well do you know her?
L616295	u8475	m575	SALLY	Yes--I remember--
L616294	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
L616293	u8475	m575	SALLY	I could see you were pining away--
L616235	u8475	m575	SALLY	Good night, idiot!
L616234	u8467	m575	BRETT	Good night, Mrs. Brett!
L616221	u8475	m575	SALLY	I think we ought to walk.
L616220	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
L616219	u8475	m575	SALLY	You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
L616218	u8467	m575	BRETT	You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
L616217	u8475	m575	SALLY	I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
L616216	u8467	m575	BRETT	I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
L616215	u8475	m575	SALLY	What?--
L616214	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
L616213	u8475	m575	SALLY	What, again?
L616201	u8475	m575	SALLY	We'll let it go at that--
L616200	u8467	m575	BRETT	Lonesome?
L616199	u8475	m575	SALLY	This time I'm really glad you showed up.
L616198	u8475	m575	SALLY	Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
L616197	u8467	m575	BRETT	Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
L616077	u8467	m575	BRETT	You said it! How about a little action?
L616076	u8475	m575	SALLY	Don't let's talk about it.
L616075	u8467	m575	BRETT	You mean that?
L616074	u8475	m575	SALLY	Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
L616073	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sally--!
L616072	u8475	m575	SALLY	--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
L616071	u8467	m575	BRETT	But--
L616070	u8475	m575	SALLY	Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
L616069	u8467	m575	BRETT	For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
L616068	u8475	m575	SALLY	Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
L616066	u8475	m575	SALLY	You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
L616065	u8467	m575	BRETT	I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
L616064	u8475	m575	SALLY	That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
L616063	u8467	m575	BRETT	A lot of things I'd like to forget.
L616062	u8475	m575	SALLY	What are you thinking?
L616061	u8467	m575	BRETT	Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
L616060	u8475	m575	SALLY	Mighty decent of you, pal.
L616059	u8467	m575	BRETT	Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
L616058	u8475	m575	SALLY	Thanks.
L616057	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sorry.
L616056	u8475	m575	SALLY	A little.
L616054	u8475	m575	SALLY	I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
L616053	u8467	m575	BRETT	You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
L616052	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
L615844	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'll be there--Good-by.
L615843	u8467	m575	BRETT	See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
L615835	u8475	m575	SALLY	Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
L615834	u8467	m575	BRETT	Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
L615833	u8475	m575	SALLY	Okay.
L615832	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sooner it you like.

L615826	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yes?
L615825	u8475	m575	SALLY	You asked me to dine with you tonight.
L615824	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't be a c-a-t.
L615823	u8475	m575	SALLY	Very--your mother?
L615822	u8467	m575	BRETT	Isn't she attractive?
L615808	u8467	m575	BRETT	--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
L615807	u8475	m575	SALLY	A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
L615806	u8467	m575	BRETT	Tell me.
L615805	u8475	m575	SALLY	What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
L615804	u8467	m575	BRETT	I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
L615803	u8475	m575	SALLY	Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
L615802	u8467	m575	BRETT	Married?
L615801	u8475	m575	SALLY	Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
L615800	u8467	m575	BRETT	You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
L615799	u8467	m575	BRETT	Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
L615798	u8475	m575	SALLY	You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
L615797	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
L615769	u8475	m575	SALLY	Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
L615768	u8467	m575	BRETT	Brett is the name.
L615767	u8475	m575	SALLY	This is Mr.--er--
L615762	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well--breakfast?  Lunch?

L615706	u8467	m575	BRETT	Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
L615705	u8475	m575	SALLY	--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.

L615700	u8467	m575	BRETT	How about giving me another coat?
L615699	u8475	m575	SALLY	So you washed it off!
L615698	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
L615697	u8475	m575	SALLY	Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
L615696	u8467	m575	BRETT	Where have you been hiding?

L616505	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
L616504	u8467	m575	BRETT	Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
L616503	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
L616268	u8467	m575	BRETT	See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
L616267	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Say--wait a minute!
L616266	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
L616265	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	<U>Me</U>!
L616264	u8467	m575	BRETT	You keep it-- 
L615934	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
L615933	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Partners, ain't we?
L615932	u8467	m575	BRETT	About sixteen hundred.
L615923	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
L615922	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
L615921	u8467	m575	BRETT	What is it?
L615920	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
L615908	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll take one. 
L615907	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Thank you, sir. 
L615906	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
L615905	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
L615884	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
L615883	u8467	m575	BRETT	Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
L615876	u8467	m575	BRETT	That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
L615875	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
L615874	u8467	m575	BRETT	They won't squawk--they're professionals.
L615858	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
L615857	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You take some awful chances.
L615856	u8467	m575	BRETT	Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
L615855	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
L615854	u8467	m575	BRETT	I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
L615853	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Are you screwy?
L615852	u8467	m575	BRETT	Inspector McKinney.
L615577	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Now you're talkin'!
L615576	u8467	m575	BRETT	Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
L615575	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
L615574	u8467	m575	BRETT	Shortie!--you know my motto?
L615569	u8467	m575	BRETT	A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
L615568	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Change?
L615567	u8467	m575	BRETT	My change.
L615566	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	No, sir?
L615565	u8467	m575	BRETT	Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
L615561	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
L615560	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
L615559	u8467	m575	BRETT	She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
L615558	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	This is a business trip!
L615557	u8467	m575	BRETT	A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
L615556	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	--there's thousands of 'em!
L615555	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
L615554	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
L615553	u8467	m575	BRETT	Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
L615552	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
L615551	u8467	m575	BRETT	Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
L615550	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Not a chance.
L615549	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
L615548	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	A dollar forty.
L615547	u8467	m575	BRETT	How're the tips?
L615546	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
L615545	u8467	m575	BRETT	Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
L615544	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
L615448	u8467	m575	BRETT	Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
L615447	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You don't think--?
L615440	u8467	m575	BRETT	Shortie, look!
L615439	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
L615435	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
L615434	u8467	m575	BRETT	Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
L615427	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	I'll watch for him, sir.
L615426	u8467	m575	BRETT	He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
L615425	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
L615424	u8467	m575	BRETT	Nix, the law!
L615423	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
L615422	u8467	m575	BRETT	No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
L615421	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
L615420	u8467	m575	BRETT	It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
L615419	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
L615418	u8467	m575	BRETT	No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
L615417	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	We coulda got two third-class!
L615416	u8467	m575	BRETT	We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
L615415	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
L615414	u8467	m575	BRETT	I thought you were a smart guy.
L615413	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
L615412	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
L615411	u8467	m575	BRETT	Not here--follow me around the shed.
L616375	u8467	m575	BRETT	Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
L616374	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	That goes two ways.
L616370	u8467	m575	BRETT	Think again--
L616369	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	I thought you were a sucker--
L616366	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why isn't that a good time to quit?
L616365	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
L616364	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
L616086	u8467	m575	BRETT	Much better--thank you--
L616085	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	How's your mother feeling?
L615918	u8467	m575	BRETT	It's a pleasure.
L615917	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	It's your deal.
L615901	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
L615900	u8467	m575	BRETT	Three Jacks.
L615899	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
L615898	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
L615881	u8467	m575	BRETT	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
L615880	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Come in! 
L616527	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Thanks. That makes us square.
L616526	u8467	m575	BRETT	Here's your fifty.
L616485	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why, I--
L616484	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
L616476	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
L616475	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't get yourself all worked up--
L616464	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
L616463	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
L616350	u8467	m575	BRETT	Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
L616349	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
L616346	u8467	m575	BRETT	It's a bet--come on, Sally!
L616345	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
L616273	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
L616272	u8467	m575	BRETT	Coming to the pool for a swim?
L616271	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Hello, young fellow!
L616249	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
L616248	u8467	m575	BRETT	Hey!--you're tickling me.
L616247	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
L616246	u8467	m575	BRETT	How about trying your fine Italian hand?
L616245	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
L616243	u8467	m575	BRETT	Swell!
L616242	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I'll go with you.
L616241	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure, I'll go.
L616240	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
L616239	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why?
L616238	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
L616237	u8467	m575	BRETT	No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
L616236	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	How about you?
L616231	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
L616230	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
L616183	u8467	m575	BRETT	Good night!
L616182	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
L616181	u8467	m575	BRETT	I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
L616177	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I wouldn't be surprised--
L616176	u8467	m575	BRETT	If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
L616175	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
L616174	u8467	m575	BRETT	It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
L616173	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
L616172	u8467	m575	BRETT	This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
L616146	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
L616145	u8467	m575	BRETT	Care to join us?
L616110	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I'll go with you--
L616109	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'm going to the show--
L615774	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	No--not quite.
L615773	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
L615772	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Before that. Your face is very familiar.
L615771	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, yes. On the pier.
L615770	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
L616502	u8469	m575	DENBY	If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
L616501	u8467	m575	BRETT	What's that?
L616500	u8469	m575	DENBY	O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
L616499	u8467	m575	BRETT	Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
L616498	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
L616497	u8467	m575	BRETT	She did?
L616496	u8469	m575	DENBY	I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
L616047	u8469	m575	DENBY	Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
L616046	u8467	m575	BRETT	I should say not.
L616045	u8469	m575	DENBY	I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
L615989	u8469	m575	DENBY	I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
L615988	u8467	m575	BRETT	She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
L615987	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
L615986	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
L615840	u8469	m575	DENBY	Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
L615839	u8467	m575	BRETT	Wait a minute--let's match for it.
L615838	u8469	m575	DENBY	That's all right. I'll attend to this.
L615786	u8469	m575	DENBY	I'm sorry to hear that.
L615785	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
L615784	u8469	m575	DENBY	That's too bad.
L615781	u8469	m575	DENBY	O.K. Heads you win.
L615780	u8467	m575	BRETT	Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
L615779	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
L615776	u8467	m575	BRETT	Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
L615775	u8469	m575	DENBY	Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
L615753	u8468	m575	DAN	Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
L615752	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
L615751	u8468	m575	DAN	Sure.
L615750	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
L615749	u8468	m575	DAN	O.K.! Send that!
L615748	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
L615747	u8468	m575	DAN	June? That's my wife's name.
L615746	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Fine! Instead of saying ""next month""--we'll use one word and say ""June."""
L615745	u8468	m575	DAN	Next month is June.
L615744	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
L615743	u8468	m575	DAN	Send that.
L615742	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Now we get it down to two words--""next month."""
L615741	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Cut it out.
L615740	u8468	m575	DAN	Sure.
L615739	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Your wife knows that, don't she?
L615738	u8468	m575	DAN	Back is in New York.
L615737	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Just a minute--I don't think we need the word ""Back"" --Where <U>is</U> ""Back""?"
L615736	u8468	m575	DAN	Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
L615735	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  ""Back in four weeks."" Instead of ""in four weeks""--say ""next month""--That saves another word."
L615734	u8468	m575	DAN	That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
L615733	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks. You don't need the ""will be."" Just say ""Back in four weeks."""
L615732	u8468	m575	DAN	How?
L615731	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
L615730	u8468	m575	DAN	That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
L615729	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Will be back in four weeks--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
L615728	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
L615727	u8468	m575	DAN	Sure.
L615726	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Your wife knows that, don't she?
L615725	u8468	m575	DAN	In New York.
L615724	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Where do you live?
L615723	u8468	m575	DAN	How?
L615722	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
L615717	u8468	m575	DAN	What'll I say?
L615716	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Here you are, sir. 
L616341	u8469	m575	DENBY	All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
L616340	u8468	m575	DAN	I was never stiffer in my life.
L616339	u8469	m575	DENBY	Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
L616338	u8468	m575	DAN	Who won?
L616337	u8469	m575	DENBY	Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
L615719	u8468	m575	DAN	That's fine.
L615718	u8469	m575	DENBY	Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
L615715	u8468	m575	DAN	She's in New York.
L615714	u8469	m575	DENBY	Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
L615713	u8468	m575	DAN	That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
L615712	u8469	m575	DENBY	This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
L615711	u8468	m575	DAN	Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
L615710	u8469	m575	DENBY	Well, did you find me?
L615709	u8468	m575	DAN	Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
L615708	u8469	m575	DENBY	I thought I put you to bed.
L615707	u8468	m575	DAN	Hello, Denby!
L615530	u8468	m575	DAN	<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
L615529	u8469	m575	DENBY	I can see where I won't talk much to you.
L615526	u8468	m575	DAN	So what?
L615525	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes--Me--in person!
L615524	u8468	m575	DAN	Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
L615523	u8469	m575	DENBY	That's me!
L615520	u8468	m575	DAN	I can see you're no gentleman--
L615519	u8469	m575	DENBY	Knots!
L615518	u8468	m575	DAN	What?
L615517	u8469	m575	DENBY	No. <U>Knots</U>!
L615516	u8468	m575	DAN	Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
L615515	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
L615514	u8468	m575	DAN	I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
L615982	u8471	m575	MARY	Never mind.
L615981	u8468	m575	DAN	Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
L615980	u8471	m575	MARY	Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
L615979	u8468	m575	DAN	That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
L615978	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, there you are--
L615522	u8468	m575	DAN	<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
L615521	u8471	m575	MARY	He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
L616483	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes!
L616482	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Is this your gun?
L616481	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
L616480	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
L616479	u8469	m575	DENBY	I didn't--
L616283	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Yeah--
L616282	u8469	m575	DENBY	Maybe he just travels in bad company.
L616281	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
L616280	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
L616279	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
L616278	u8469	m575	DENBY	I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
L616277	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
L616276	u8469	m575	DENBY	Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
L615849	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
L615848	u8469	m575	DENBY	It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
L615847	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
L615846	u8469	m575	DENBY	It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
L615845	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
L615815	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
L615814	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
L615811	u8469	m575	DENBY	Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
L615810	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
L615809	u8469	m575	DENBY	Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
L615766	u8469	m575	DENBY	Miss Marsh.
L615765	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	McKinney's the name.
L616402	u8469	m575	DENBY	Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
L616401	u8475	m575	SALLY	Why--don't you like him?
L616400	u8475	m575	SALLY	Very--
L616399	u8469	m575	DENBY	Very serious?
L616398	u8475	m575	SALLY	Yes.
L615793	u8469	m575	DENBY	<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
L615792	u8475	m575	SALLY	I don't get the humor of that remark.
L615791	u8469	m575	DENBY	What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
L615790	u8475	m575	SALLY	You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
L615622	u8469	m575	DENBY	Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
L615621	u8475	m575	SALLY	Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
L615620	u8469	m575	DENBY	I'll never love anybody else.
L615619	u8475	m575	SALLY	Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
L615618	u8469	m575	DENBY	But not nice enough to marry--eh?
L615617	u8475	m575	SALLY	Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
L615616	u8469	m575	DENBY	Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
L615615	u8475	m575	SALLY	Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
L615614	u8469	m575	DENBY	I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
L615613	u8475	m575	SALLY	I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
L615612	u8469	m575	DENBY	I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
L615611	u8475	m575	SALLY	It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
L615610	u8469	m575	DENBY	News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
L615609	u8475	m575	SALLY	You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
L615608	u8469	m575	DENBY	Do what--
L615607	u8475	m575	SALLY	I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
L615606	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
L615605	u8475	m575	SALLY	Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
L615604	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--not much--excepting-- 
L615603	u8475	m575	SALLY	You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
L615602	u8469	m575	DENBY	Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
L615601	u8475	m575	SALLY	And you've put it over--haven't you?
L615600	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
L615599	u8475	m575	SALLY	Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
L615598	u8469	m575	DENBY	Like it?
L615597	u8475	m575	SALLY	Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
L615596	u8475	m575	SALLY	Just what the doctor ordered.
L615595	u8469	m575	DENBY	Everything O.K.?
L615594	u8475	m575	SALLY	Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
L615593	u8469	m575	DENBY	You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
L615592	u8475	m575	SALLY	Am I a member of this club?
L615395	u8475	m575	SALLY	Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
L615394	u8469	m575	DENBY	Are you happy?
L615393	u8475	m575	SALLY	Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
L616411	u8469	m575	DENBY	You don't shoot squirrels.
L616410	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Meaning what?
L616409	u8469	m575	DENBY	I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
L616408	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
L616407	u8469	m575	DENBY	Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
L616406	u8470	m575	LOTHER	What do you mean?
L616405	u8469	m575	DENBY	I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
L616533	u8469	m575	DENBY	Good-night, folks.
L616532	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
L616123	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
L616122	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
L615984	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
L615983	u8469	m575	DENBY	H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
L615513	u8469	m575	DENBY	"No--He's probably one of the ""Here's How.""  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--"
L615512	u8471	m575	MARY	Is that one of the Who's Who?
L615511	u8469	m575	DENBY	Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
L615510	u8471	m575	MARY	Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
L615509	u8469	m575	DENBY	All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
L615508	u8471	m575	MARY	Get that out of your trunk.
L615507	u8469	m575	DENBY	So what?
L615506	u8471	m575	MARY	--And he has sex appeal.
L615505	u8469	m575	DENBY	So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
L615504	u8471	m575	MARY	Well, he has a straw hat--
L615503	u8469	m575	DENBY	What's he got that I haven't got?
L615502	u8471	m575	MARY	Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
L615501	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
L615500	u8471	m575	MARY	With your dry wit and humor--
L615352	u8469	m575	DENBY	Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
L615351	u8471	m575	MARY	When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
L615350	u8469	m575	DENBY	All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
L615349	u8471	m575	MARY	I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
L615348	u8469	m575	DENBY	Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
L615347	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
L615345	u8469	m575	DENBY	Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
L615344	u8471	m575	MARY	Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
L615343	u8469	m575	DENBY	H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
L615342	u8471	m575	MARY	I'm getting seasick--
L615341	u8469	m575	DENBY	What's the matter, Mary?
L615340	u8471	m575	MARY	But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
L615339	u8469	m575	DENBY	Very good, Mary--
L615338	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
L615337	u8469	m575	DENBY	Well, let's hear the poem--
L615336	u8471	m575	MARY	Somebody's got to do it--
L615335	u8469	m575	DENBY	But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
L615334	u8471	m575	MARY	I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
L615333	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
L616210	u8469	m575	DENBY	Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
L616209	u8473	m575	NED	Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
L616208	u8469	m575	DENBY	What for?
L616207	u8473	m575	NED	You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
L616206	u8469	m575	DENBY	What happened to you?
L615591	u8473	m575	NED	No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
L615590	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
L615589	u8473	m575	NED	Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
L615588	u8469	m575	DENBY	"Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--""Gee you're tight.""-- and the window says--""You loosen up a bit and so will I.""--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?"
L615929	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
L615928	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I went for four.
L615927	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	About twelve hundred.
L615926	u8470	m575	LOTHER	How much did you lose?
L615913	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
L615912	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
L615871	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
L615870	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	The country boy's about due.
L615869	u8470	m575	LOTHER	The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
L615868	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
L615867	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Can you read 'em Jack?
L615680	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
L615679	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	That's him! That's the sucker!!
L615676	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
L615675	u8470	m575	LOTHER	"He works the boats as a ""come-on"" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself."
L615674	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Eh?... Oh.
L615673	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
L616419	u8475	m575	SALLY	Not a chance--I'm through. 
L616418	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
L616196	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
L616195	u8475	m575	SALLY	Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
L616194	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
L616193	u8475	m575	SALLY	I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
L616192	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
L615999	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
L615998	u8475	m575	SALLY	Don't, Lee--that's dead.
L615997	u8470	m575	LOTHER	That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
L615996	u8475	m575	SALLY	--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
L615995	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
L615994	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
L615976	u8475	m575	SALLY	You can't bluff me any more.
L615975	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
L615974	u8475	m575	SALLY	Not because of Ned.
L615971	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
L615970	u8475	m575	SALLY	--you'd go with him!
L615969	u8470	m575	LOTHER	A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
L615968	u8475	m575	SALLY	You leave the kid alone.
L615967	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Thanks to me.
L615966	u8475	m575	SALLY	He's all right.
L615965	u8470	m575	LOTHER	That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
L615964	u8475	m575	SALLY	You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
L615963	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
L615962	u8475	m575	SALLY	I wish I could.
L615961	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
L615960	u8475	m575	SALLY	Why don't you leave me alone?
L615959	u8470	m575	LOTHER	It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
L615958	u8475	m575	SALLY	I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
L615957	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
L615956	u8475	m575	SALLY	All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
L616478	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
L616477	u8473	m575	NED	I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
L616474	u8473	m575	NED	Because I was yellow, I guess--
L616473	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Why?
L616472	u8473	m575	NED	I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
L616471	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
L616470	u8473	m575	NED	No!
L616469	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
L616468	u8473	m575	NED	Yes, Yes!
L616529	u8475	m575	SALLY	He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
L616528	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
L616519	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
L616518	u8475	m575	SALLY	I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
L616517	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
L616462	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
L616461	u8475	m575	SALLY	Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
L616460	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I sincerely hope so--
L616459	u8475	m575	SALLY	That's the truth--every single word!
L616361	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
L616360	u8475	m575	SALLY	Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
L616359	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
L616358	u8475	m575	SALLY	Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
L616357	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I mean if you knew it were stolen.
L616356	u8475	m575	SALLY	"Say, ""Thanks very much!"""
L616355	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
L616354	u8475	m575	SALLY	Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
L616353	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Congratulations.
L616233	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Good night!
L616232	u8475	m575	SALLY	It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
L616258	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
L616257	u8474	m575	PURSER	What's the matter?
L616256	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
L616255	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	It all depends on what you're used to.
L616254	u8474	m575	PURSER	I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
L616253	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Smooth's the word.
L616252	u8474	m575	PURSER	He's certainly good-natured.
L615864	u8474	m575	PURSER	Thirty one's and two ten's?
L615863	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Thank you.
L615862	u8474	m575	PURSER	There you are, sir.
L616140	u8473	m575	NED	If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
L616139	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'll explain later--
L616138	u8473	m575	NED	What!--are you crazy?
L616137	u8475	m575	SALLY	I was in his cabin--
L616136	u8473	m575	NED	You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
L616135	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm all right.
L615941	u8475	m575	SALLY	Aren't the roses beautiful?
L615940	u8473	m575	NED	Sure, Sis.
L615939	u8475	m575	SALLY	Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
L615397	u8475	m575	SALLY	Do you think Lother could have seen it?
L615396	u8473	m575	NED	I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
L616330	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Because you ran after me.
L616329	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Then why did you run away?
L616328	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
L616327	u8477	m575	STEWARD	I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
L616326	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
L616317	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Hey--you! Where you going?
L616316	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Ain't got time.
L616315	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Let me look at it.
L616314	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Nothin'.
L615564	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
L615563	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Telegrams.
L615562	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
L630037	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
L630036	u8657	m587	COLE	I understand.  There'd be no point.
L630029	u8657	m587	COLE	"Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it...""dimensions."" It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not."
L630028	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	"You said we weren't ""real,"" Cole..."
L630025	u8657	m587	COLE	No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
L630024	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	"The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become ""addicted"" have you, Cole?  To that ""dying"" world'"
L630006	u8657	m587	COLE	"I DON'T WANT YOUR ""WOMEN,"" YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!"
L630005	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Women will want to get to know you...
L629711	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
L629710	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Him?  You saw that man?
L629694	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, what?
L629693	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Well?
L629498	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
L629497	u8657	m587	COLE	No, sir!
L629489	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, I didn't hear the...
L629488	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Wake up, Cole.
L629479	u8657	m587	COLE	I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
L629478	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We want you to tell us about last night.
L630002	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	This is it, James...what you've been working for.
L630001	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We're very close!  Because of you!
L629993	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	You're still a little... disoriented.
L629992	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
L629696	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
L629695	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
L629502	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	For a man in your position...an opportunity.
L629501	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	"We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with ""unstable"" types."
L629496	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
L629495	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	To be determined by the proper authorities.
L630089	u8661	m587	FALE	Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
L630088	u8655	m587	BEN	Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
L630056	u8661	m587	FALE	She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
L630055	u8655	m587	BEN	What's she doing?
L630054	u8661	m587	FALE	It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
L629850	u8655	m587	BEN	What are you going to do with us?
L629849	u8661	m587	FALE	That's him.
L629842	u8661	m587	FALE	Shut up!
L629841	u8655	m587	BEN	I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
L630052	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
L630051	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	So that...???
L630050	u8657	m587	COLE	To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
L630049	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	And your only goal is...???
L630048	u8657	m587	COLE	That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
L630047	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	Meaning...???
L630046	u8657	m587	COLE	San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
L630045	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
L630044	u8657	m587	COLE	It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
L630043	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
L629705	u8657	m587	COLE	I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
L629704	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
L629703	u8657	m587	COLE	They forced me to take drugs.
L629485	u8657	m587	COLE	I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
L629484	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	It's important to observe everything.
L630221	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
L630220	u8657	m587	COLE	Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
L630219	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
L630218	u8657	m587	COLE	I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
L630217	u8666	m587	RAILLY	They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
L630215	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
L630214	u8657	m587	COLE	I know this place! ... This is my dream.
L630209	u8657	m587	COLE	"On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, ""We did it."""
L630208	u8666	m587	RAILLY	That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
L630200	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
L630199	u8657	m587	COLE	I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
L630198	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Well, you look pretty different, too.
L630197	u8657	m587	COLE	You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
L630191	u8666	m587	RAILLY	In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
L630190	u8657	m587	COLE	But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
L630189	u8666	m587	RAILLY	So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
L630188	u8657	m587	COLE	Why are we doing this?
L630186	u8657	m587	COLE	Flowers!  What flowers?
L630185	u8666	m587	RAILLY	If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
L630184	u8657	m587	COLE	I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
L630183	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
L630182	u8657	m587	COLE	I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
L630153	u8657	m587	COLE	They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
L630152	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You... you couldn't have heard me.
L630150	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
L630149	u8657	m587	COLE	You... you left them a message?
L630148	u8666	m587	RAILLY	No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
L630147	u8657	m587	COLE	A Carpet Cleaning Company?
L630146	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
L630133	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I...I...We need cash, James.
L630132	u8657	m587	COLE	You want me to rob him?
L630123	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
L630122	u8657	m587	COLE	I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
L630121	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
L630120	u8657	m587	COLE	You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
L630119	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
L630118	u8657	m587	COLE	...I had a dream about...something like that.
L630117	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What does this mean to you?
L630115	u8666	m587	RAILLY	IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
L630114	u8657	m587	COLE	I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
L630113	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
L630112	u8657	m587	COLE	It was?  I didn't...know.
L630111	u8666	m587	RAILLY	The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
L630110	u8657	m587	COLE	I don't know -- I don't remember.
L630109	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
L630108	u8657	m587	COLE	No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
L630107	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Just like that?  You were in prison?
L630106	u8657	m587	COLE	I thought I was in...prison again.
L630105	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
L630098	u8657	m587	COLE	You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
L630097	u8666	m587	RAILLY	We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
L630096	u8657	m587	COLE	I don't understand what we're doing.
L630082	u8657	m587	COLE	No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
L630081	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
L629962	u8657	m587	COLE	No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
L629961	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You're sure?
L629960	u8657	m587	COLE	The gun! ... I lost it
L629959	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Give me the gun.
L629958	u8657	m587	COLE	It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
L629957	u8666	m587	RAILLY	First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
L629956	u8657	m587	COLE	I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
L629955	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
L629954	u8657	m587	COLE	"I'm...""mentally divergent"".  I would love to believe that."
L629953	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
L629952	u8657	m587	COLE	Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
L629951	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What made you think that?
L629950	u8657	m587	COLE	Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
L629949	u8666	m587	RAILLY	See -- you can drive after all!
L629948	u8657	m587	COLE	No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
L629947	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
L629887	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You have to give yourself up, you know.
L629886	u8657	m587	COLE	You smell so good.
L629880	u8657	m587	COLE	That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
L629879	u8666	m587	RAILLY	No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
L629878	u8657	m587	COLE	You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
L629877	u8657	m587	COLE	It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
L629876	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Shot!  Who shot you?
L629875	u8657	m587	COLE	I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
L629874	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What's the matter with your leg?
L629873	u8657	m587	COLE	I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
L629872	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I thought you didn't know how to drive.
L629871	u8657	m587	COLE	We need gas.
L629868	u8666	m587	RAILLY	And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
L629867	u8657	m587	COLE	The guy was a total fruitcake.
L629866	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
L629865	u8657	m587	COLE	All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
L629844	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Jeffrey Mason?
L629843	u8657	m587	COLE	Mason???
L629840	u8657	m587	COLE	Lock it now!
L629839	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, why don't we...?
L629838	u8657	m587	COLE	I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
L629827	u8657	m587	COLE	I've got one now.
L629826	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You didn't have a gun before, did you?
L629825	u8657	m587	COLE	I did him a favor.  Now come on.
L629824	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
L629821	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
L629820	u8657	m587	COLE	Are you hurt?
L629814	u8657	m587	COLE	The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
L629813	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Who's keeping an eye on you?
L629812	u8657	m587	COLE	They're keeping an eye on me.
L629809	u8666	m587	RAILLY	"I'm not going to ""do"" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is."
L629808	u8657	m587	COLE	Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
L629804	u8657	m587	COLE	Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
L629803	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
L629802	u8657	m587	COLE	When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
L629801	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
L629797	u8657	m587	COLE	I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
L629796	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
L629795	u8657	m587	COLE	A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
L629794	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Clues?  What kind of clues?
L629793	u8657	m587	COLE	My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
L629789	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
L629788	u8657	m587	COLE	No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
L629787	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
L629786	u8657	m587	COLE	You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
L629785	u8666	m587	RAILLY	And I was in it?  What did I do?
L629784	u8657	m587	COLE	About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
L629783	u8666	m587	RAILLY	We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
L629782	u8657	m587	COLE	You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
L629777	u8657	m587	COLE	Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
L629776	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
L629775	u8657	m587	COLE	Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
L629774	u8666	m587	RAILLY	If something really happens...like what, James?
L629773	u8657	m587	COLE	"My father told me that.  ""Never cry wolf.""  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens."
L629772	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What?
L629771	u8657	m587	COLE	Never cry wolf!
L629769	u8657	m587	COLE	Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
L629768	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
L629767	u8657	m587	COLE	"You used to call me ""James""."
L629764	u8657	m587	COLE	It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
L629763	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
L629762	u8657	m587	COLE	You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
L629761	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
L629760	u8657	m587	COLE	1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
L629759	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
L629674	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
L629673	u8657	m587	COLE	No more drugs.  Please...
L629672	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It's just a shot to calm you.
L629617	u8657	m587	COLE	Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
L629616	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
L629615	u8657	m587	COLE	What?
L629614	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
L629613	u8657	m587	COLE	No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
L629612	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Perhaps it was a wrong number...
L629611	u8657	m587	COLE	It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
L629556	u8666	m587	RAILLY	1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
L629555	u8657	m587	COLE	No, 1995 is the past.
L629554	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
L629553	u8657	m587	COLE	1995?
L629552	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What year do you think it is?
L629551	u8657	m587	COLE	What year is it?
L629550	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Do you know what year it is?
L629549	u8657	m587	COLE	July?!
L629548	u8666	m587	RAILLY	July.
L629547	u8657	m587	COLE	This is April, right?
L629546	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
L629545	u8657	m587	COLE	I have to go.
L629544	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You're afraid of germs?
L629543	u8657	m587	COLE	It's so clean.  No germs.
L629542	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What's wonderful about the air, James?
L629541	u8657	m587	COLE	I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
L629540	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Hiding?
L629539	u8657	m587	COLE	Underground.
L629538	u8666	m587	RAILLY	A jail?  Prison?
L629537	u8657	m587	COLE	I have to go.
L629536	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
L629535	u8657	m587	COLE	You wouldn't understand.
L629534	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Why not?  Most people have some ID.
L629533	u8657	m587	COLE	No.
L629532	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
L629531	u8657	m587	COLE	They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
L629530	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
L629529	u8657	m587	COLE	Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
L629528	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Do you know why you're here, James.
L629527	u8657	m587	COLE	I need to go.
L629526	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Change what?
L629525	u8657	m587	COLE	It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
L629524	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What kind of information?
L629523	u8657	m587	COLE	No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
L629522	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
L629521	u8657	m587	COLE	James!  Nobody ever calls me that.
L629520	u8666	m587	RAILLY	"I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you ""James""?"
L629519	u8657	m587	COLE	I need to go now.
L629518	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
L629602	u8657	m587	COLE	"No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, ""voice mail"".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present."
L629601	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
L629600	u8657	m587	COLE	Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
L629599	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
L629598	u8657	m587	COLE	No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
L629597	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
L629926	u8657	m587	COLE	Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
L629925	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, ""Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"""
L629924	u8657	m587	COLE	Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
L629923	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, ""Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?""  You do remember that, don't you?"
L629922	u8657	m587	COLE	Plan?  What are you talking about?
L629921	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
L629920	u8657	m587	COLE	I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
L629918	u8657	m587	COLE	I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
L629917	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
L629916	u8657	m587	COLE	Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
L629915	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"County Hospital, right?  1989.  The ""Immaculate Escape"" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too."
L629905	u8657	m587	COLE	Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
L629904	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Excuse me -- what did you say?
L629903	u8657	m587	COLE	I'm here about some monkeys.
L629902	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
L629901	u8657	m587	COLE	You do know me.  You helped me once.
L629900	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
L629649	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"Not, ""what"", babe!  When!"
L629648	u8657	m587	COLE	What...???
L629647	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
L629646	u8657	m587	COLE	What....???
L629643	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
L629642	u8657	m587	COLE	It's private.
L629641	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What're you writing?  You a reporter?
L629640	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	You know -- your plan.
L629639	u8657	m587	COLE	What are you talking about???
L629638	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about ""you know what""."
L629637	u8657	m587	COLE	Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
L629636	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
L629635	u8657	m587	COLE	They hurt you!
L629632	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
L629631	u8657	m587	COLE	What's that mean?
L629630	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
L629629	u8657	m587	COLE	If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
L629628	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
L629627	u8657	m587	COLE	I'm not crazy.
L629626	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"What about the germs?  I say.  He goes, ""I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!"" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?"
L629625	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible ""bad things"" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...""germs""!"
L629624	u8657	m587	COLE	Germs?!
L629574	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
L629573	u8657	m587	COLE	I need to make a telephone call.
L629572	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
L630251	u8657	m587	COLE	Who am I supposed to shoot?
L630250	u8664	m587	JOSE	They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
L630249	u8657	m587	COLE	It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
L630248	u8664	m587	JOSE	Hey, man...
L630247	u8657	m587	COLE	This part isn't about the virus, is it?
L630241	u8664	m587	JOSE	"Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... ""weird"" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!"
L630240	u8657	m587	COLE	The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
L630239	u8664	m587	JOSE	The phone call, man.  The phone call.
L630238	u8657	m587	COLE	How did you find me?
L630237	u8664	m587	JOSE	Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
L630235	u8664	m587	JOSE	Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
L630234	u8657	m587	COLE	Jo...Jose????
L629737	u8664	m587	JOSE	Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
L629736	u8657	m587	COLE	JOSE!
L630031	u8657	m587	COLE	Yes, sir.
L630030	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	But you know what's real now?
L629699	u8657	m587	COLE	I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
L629698	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
L629697	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, that message...me?
L629491	u8657	m587	COLE	Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
L629490	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	I asked you, why did you volunteer?
L629481	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
L629480	u8657	m587	COLE	I mashed the spider, didn't I?
L630013	u8666	m587	RAILLY	"And what we believe is what's accepted as ""truth"" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith."
L630012	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
L630011	u8666	m587	RAILLY	For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
L630010	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
L629687	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
L629686	u8666	m587	RAILLY	He was fully sedated!
L629681	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
L629680	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
L629679	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
L629678	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
L629677	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
L629676	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
L629675	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
L630179	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
L630178	u8659	m587	DR. MASON	Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
L630177	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"You ""develop"" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever ""developed"" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!"
L630176	u8659	m587	DR. MASON	You're insane, Jeffrey.
L630175	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What virus are we talking about, Dad?
L630174	u8659	m587	DR. MASON	She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
L630173	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What...virus?
L630091	u8661	m587	FALE	Then how come she knows what's going on?
L630090	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous ""pretend-friend-to- animals""?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!"
L630078	u8661	m587	FALE	That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
L630077	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
L630076	u8661	m587	FALE	"Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, ""your psychiatrist""?"
L630075	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
L630071	u8661	m587	FALE	No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
L630070	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	You really want to know?
L630069	u8661	m587	FALE	One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
L629517	u8662	m587	FRANKI	I'll be right here...just in case.
L629516	u8666	m587	RAILLY	No, thank you.
L629515	u8662	m587	FRANKI	James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
L629514	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
L629513	u8662	m587	FRANKI	You want to go in?  Examine him?
L629512	u8666	m587	RAILLY	That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
L629511	u8662	m587	FRANKI	Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
L629510	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You have him in restraints.
L629509	u8662	m587	FRANKI	Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
L629508	u8666	m587	RAILLY	He's been tested for drugs?
L629507	u8662	m587	FRANKI	-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
L630206	u8667	m587	WOMAN CABBIE	Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
L630205	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What?  What did you say?
L630204	u8667	m587	WOMAN CABBIE	On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
L630203	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
L630202	u8667	m587	WOMAN CABBIE	Might be tight.
L630201	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Nine thirty
L634416	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes.
L634415	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	Is that the entire message?
L634414	u8697	m590	DAVID	Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
L634413	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	Proceed.
L634411	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	I had to put him down.
L634410	u8697	m590	DAVID	Wow.
L634409	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
L634408	u8697	m590	DAVID	Oh.
L634407	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
L634406	u8697	m590	DAVID	Is Noel in?
L634405	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	Yes?
L634487	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	I have a lock on the door.
L634486	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	What about Jeb?
L634485	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	I'll keep it in my office room.
L634484	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I'm listening.
L634480	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
L634479	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	What did I say?
L634478	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
L634477	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	No.
L634476	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	Four.
L634475	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How old is Jeb?
L634474	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
L634473	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Once again please?
L634471	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You've made a considerably wise decision.
L634470	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	Wrap it up.
L634858	u8702	m590	MEGAN	It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
L634857	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't know Megan.
L634856	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Why?
L634853	u8702	m590	MEGAN	That counts.
L634852	u8697	m590	DAVID	I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
L634851	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
L634850	u8702	m590	MEGAN	It's finished. I won.
L634849	u8697	m590	DAVID	What about the game?
L634848	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Think carefully?
L634847	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm not sure.
L634844	u8702	m590	MEGAN	My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
L634843	u8697	m590	DAVID	Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
L634842	u8702	m590	MEGAN	We're supposed to be honest.
L634841	u8697	m590	DAVID	What was that?
L634840	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
L634839	u8697	m590	DAVID	My turn. What's your favorite song?
L634838	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
L634837	u8697	m590	DAVID	As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
L634836	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Rust?
L634835	u8697	m590	DAVID	...I think rust.
L634780	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
L634779	u8702	m590	MEGAN	He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
L634778	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jesus.
L634777	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
L634775	u8697	m590	DAVID	out again?
L634774	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Yes.
L634773	u8697	m590	DAVID	Would you like to try going--
L634771	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
L634770	u8702	m590	MEGAN	He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
L634669	u8702	m590	MEGAN	You use your sleeve.
L634668	u8697	m590	DAVID	What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
L634664	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
L634663	u8697	m590	DAVID	...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
L634660	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
L634659	u8697	m590	DAVID	I remember you.
L634658	u8702	m590	MEGAN	My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
L634657	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
L634656	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Yes. Is this David?
L634655	u8697	m590	DAVID	Megan?
L634538	u8697	m590	DAVID	Oh.
L634537	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I've come to a decision.
L634449	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
L634448	u8697	m590	DAVID	Oh shit...
L634447	u8702	m590	MEGAN	The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
L634446	u8697	m590	DAVID	When was the last time I wore pink?
L634443	u8697	m590	DAVID	No that's it.
L634442	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
L634441	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes.
L634440	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is that what you wanted to ask me?
L634439	u8702	m590	MEGAN	It means we're probably to tired to remember.
L634438	u8697	m590	DAVID	That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
L634437	u8702	m590	MEGAN	...I can't remember.
L634435	u8697	m590	DAVID	Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
L634434	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Not a specific day. What's this about?
L634433	u8697	m590	DAVID	Do you remember me getting sick?
L634432	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Okay.
L634431	u8697	m590	DAVID	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
L634430	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I don't know. It's been a while.
L634427	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Oh.
L634426	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's asleep.
L634425	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is Jeremy okay?
L634372	u8697	m590	DAVID	I know.
L634371	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
L634370	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
L634369	u8702	m590	MEGAN	What does that mean?
L634368	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't think I got the job in New York.
L634819	u8697	m590	DAVID	No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
L634818	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Are you finished?
L634817	u8697	m590	DAVID	You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
L634816	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
L634815	u8697	m590	DAVID	Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
L634814	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	That's not what I witnessed David.
L634813	u8697	m590	DAVID	I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
L634593	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
L634592	u8697	m590	DAVID	Quick.
L634591	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	One last question.
L634590	u8697	m590	DAVID	I have to go now.
L634589	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
L634588	u8697	m590	DAVID	The guy might not have been carrying anything.
L634587	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
L634586	u8697	m590	DAVID	Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
L634585	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
L634584	u8697	m590	DAVID	Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
L634583	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You're skill.
L634582	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't know what you're asking?
L634581	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Have you ever tried to develop it?
L634580	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes.
L634579	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Telling when people have done something wrong?
L634578	u8697	m590	DAVID	Like what?
L634577	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
L634576	u8697	m590	DAVID	I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
L634575	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	But not a knife?
L634574	u8697	m590	DAVID	I thought he was carrying something.
L634573	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You thought he was carrying a knife?
L634572	u8697	m590	DAVID	Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
L634571	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
L634570	u8697	m590	DAVID	I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
L634568	u8697	m590	DAVID	That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
L634567	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Is there a problem?
L634566	u8697	m590	DAVID	Just give me a minute.
L634559	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
L634558	u8697	m590	DAVID	Are you for real?
L634557	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
L634555	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	We've already begun.
L634554	u8697	m590	DAVID	We're not proceeding anywhere together.
L634553	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
L634552	u8697	m590	DAVID	What do you want?
L634551	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
L634550	u8697	m590	DAVID	It's for last week's game.
L634529	u8697	m590	DAVID	I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
L634528	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You've misunderstood.
L634527	u8697	m590	DAVID	What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
L634526	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
L634525	u8697	m590	DAVID	At the church... You were following me weren't you?
L634519	u8697	m590	DAVID	What was your idea Elijah?
L634518	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
L634516	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
L634515	u8697	m590	DAVID	"You forgot the ""Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on"" step. See usually that comes before the, ""It's over"" Step. And it always, always comes before the ""You can go"" Step.  What is over?"
L634512	u8697	m590	DAVID	You assumed wrong.
L634511	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I assumed because of the train.
L634509	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Was it serious?
L634508	u8697	m590	DAVID	In college. A car accident.
L634507	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	What's he talking about?
L634505	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
L634504	u8697	m590	DAVID	Skeptical about what?
L634503	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
L634502	u8697	m590	DAVID	Seventy-five percent.
L634501	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
L634496	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
L634495	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You've never been sick?
L634931	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	Yes he is.
L634930	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's kind of a miracle.
L634929	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
L634928	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's doing well today.
L634927	u8697	m590	DAVID	We are.
L634926	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
L634925	u8697	m590	DAVID	It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
L634924	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
L634744	u8703	m590	WALKIE	Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
L634743	u8697	m590	DAVID	When?
L634742	u8703	m590	WALKIE	There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
L634741	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yeah?
L634547	u8703	m590	WALKIE	Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
L634546	u8697	m590	DAVID	Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
L634545	u8703	m590	WALKIE	He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
L634544	u8697	m590	DAVID	What's he look like?
L634543	u8703	m590	WALKIE	Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
L634798	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
L634797	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Don't be scared.
L634796	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy listen to what--
L634795	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'll just shoot him once.
L634792	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
L634791	u8700	m590	JEREMY	You're lying.
L634790	u8697	m590	DAVID	That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
L634785	u8697	m590	DAVID	Elijah was wrong.
L634784	u8700	m590	JEREMY	YOU WON'T GET HURT...
L634695	u8700	m590	JEREMY	You're secret identity.  That man was right.
L634694	u8697	m590	DAVID	Know what?
L634693	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I know now.
L634692	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Do you know why?
L634691	u8697	m590	DAVID	That's great.
L634690	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'm not scared.
L634689	u8697	m590	DAVID	I see.
L634688	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'm sleeping in my room.
L634648	u8697	m590	DAVID	There's no more left?
L634647	u8700	m590	JEREMY	All of it.
L634646	u8697	m590	DAVID	How many did you put on that time?
L634645	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Get mom.
L634644	u8697	m590	DAVID	What do you do if something happens?
L634638	u8697	m590	DAVID	Two hundred and seventy.
L634637	u8700	m590	JEREMY	How much is it?
L634635	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I lied.
L634634	u8697	m590	DAVID	How much did you take off?
L634632	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
L634631	u8697	m590	DAVID	No Jeremy.
L634630	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I mean if you knew karate?
L634629	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634625	u8700	m590	JEREMY	How much can you lift?
L634624	u8697	m590	DAVID	You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
L634621	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
L634620	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634619	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
L634618	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634617	u8700	m590	JEREMY	You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
L634614	u8697	m590	DAVID	There's nothing to do.
L634613	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'll help you.
L634612	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm going to work out.
L634611	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What things?
L634610	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
L634609	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Just one--
L634608	u8697	m590	DAVID	Why'd you do that?
L634607	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
L634606	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm going to go in.
L634605	u8697	m590	DAVID	In under six seconds.  I've heard.
L634604	u8700	m590	JEREMY	He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
L634379	u8697	m590	DAVID	How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
L634378	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I won't make any noise.
L634377	u8697	m590	DAVID	I think it's be better if I was alone.
L634376	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I want to sleep here tonight.
L634375	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
L634922	u8704	m590	WOMAN	That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
L634921	u8697	m590	DAVID	He doesn't look very threatening.
L634654	u8704	m590	WOMAN	Is David Dunne there?
L634653	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yeah, hello.
L634327	u8704	m590	WOMAN	This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
L634326	u8697	m590	DAVID	Not really.
L634325	u8704	m590	WOMAN	I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
L634324	u8697	m590	DAVID	You represent someone in Philadelphia?
L634323	u8697	m590	DAVID	But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
L634322	u8704	m590	WOMAN	Is that right?
L634321	u8697	m590	DAVID	What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
L634320	u8704	m590	WOMAN	It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
L634319	u8697	m590	DAVID	You like sports?
L634354	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634353	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	Did you get up from your seat?
L634352	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634351	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	Was your family traveling with you?
L634350	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
L634349	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	In the passenger car?
L634348	u8697	m590	DAVID	Against a window.
L634347	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	Where were you sitting on the train?
L634346	u8697	m590	DAVID	Fine.
L634345	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
L634344	u8697	m590	DAVID	Okay.
L634343	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	How are you feeling?
L634735	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
L634734	u8702	m590	MEGAN	For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
L634733	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
L634732	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is this a religious thing?
L634730	u8702	m590	MEGAN	And what was that explanation?
L634729	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
L634721	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	...And everyone lived happily ever after.
L634720	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
L634719	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You and my mother would have a special connection.
L634718	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
L634717	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How so?
L634716	u8702	m590	MEGAN	...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
L634715	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Now you're going to have to tell me more.
L634713	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How did you get together?
L634712	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Twelve years.
L634711	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How long have you been married?
L634710	u8702	m590	MEGAN	We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
L634462	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	On a bench, across the street.
L634461	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Where is it?
L634460	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	Well, go get it then.
L634459	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	Forget why. Do you want it or not?
L634458	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Why?
L634457	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	...I got a present for you.
L634454	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
L634453	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
L634452	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
L636533	u8720	m592	BAER	There's more.
L636532	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Keyser Soze
L636526	u8728	m592	KUJAN	And ?
L636525	u8720	m592	BAER	A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
L636359	u8720	m592	BAER	Bear with me here...
L636358	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Who ?
L636357	u8720	m592	BAER	They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
L636356	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I don't get it.
L636355	u8720	m592	BAER	He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
L636354	u8728	m592	KUJAN	What was the money for?
L636353	u8720	m592	BAER	We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
L636352	u8728	m592	KUJAN	There was ninety-one million -
L636351	u8720	m592	BAER	You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
L636350	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Yeah.
L636349	u8720	m592	BAER	I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
L636348	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Jack. What are you doing here?
L636437	u8721	m592	BODI	He says the hair is longer and lighter.
L636436	u8727	m592	KOVASH	&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
L636435	u8721	m592	BODI	&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
L636434	u8727	m592	KOVASH	&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
L636433	u8721	m592	BODI	+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
L636432	u8727	m592	KOVASH	&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
L636283	u8721	m592	BODI	He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
L636282	u8727	m592	KOVASH	&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
L636273	u8721	m592	BODI	No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
L636272	u8727	m592	KOVASH	&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
L636267	u8727	m592	KOVASH	&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
L636266	u8721	m592	BODI	Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
L636263	u8721	m592	BODI	He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
L636262	u8727	m592	KOVASH	&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
L636152	u8725	m592	KEATON	Edie, please.
L636151	u8722	m592	EDIE	I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
L636150	u8725	m592	KEATON	That's enough, Edie.
L636131	u8725	m592	KEATON	Alright.
L636130	u8722	m592	EDIE	Come home, Dean.
L636126	u8722	m592	EDIE	Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
L636125	u8725	m592	KEATON	They ruined me tonight.
L636124	u8722	m592	EDIE	I love you.
L636123	u8725	m592	KEATON	They'll never stop.
L636122	u8722	m592	EDIE	Don't give up on me now, Dean.
L636121	u8725	m592	KEATON	No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
L636120	u8722	m592	EDIE	Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
L636119	u8725	m592	KEATON	Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
L636118	u8722	m592	EDIE	They just said they wanted time.
L636117	u8725	m592	KEATON	Goddamnit.
L636116	u8722	m592	EDIE	They want more time to think about investing.
L636115	u8725	m592	KEATON	Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
L636114	u8722	m592	EDIE	I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
L636112	u8725	m592	KEATON	Just forget about it.
L636111	u8722	m592	EDIE	...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
L635887	u8722	m592	EDIE	You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
L635886	u8725	m592	KEATON	I'm having a stroke.
L635885	u8722	m592	EDIE	Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
L636149	u8722	m592	EDIE	A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
L636148	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Umm ...
L636147	u8722	m592	EDIE	So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
L636140	u8732	m592	VERBAL	A glass of water would be nice.
L636139	u8722	m592	EDIE	I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
L636138	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I hope I didn't disturb you.
L636137	u8722	m592	EDIE	I know who he is.
L636401	u8723	m592	FENSTER	I don't know. This is bad.
L636400	u8725	m592	KEATON	Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
L636399	u8723	m592	FENSTER	Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
L636398	u8723	m592	FENSTER	I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
L636397	u8725	m592	KEATON	This is not right.
L635984	u8725	m592	KEATON	I don't want to know.
L635983	u8723	m592	FENSTER	Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
L635981	u8723	m592	FENSTER	I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
L635980	u8725	m592	KEATON	It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
L635979	u8723	m592	FENSTER	So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
L635978	u8725	m592	KEATON	How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
L635977	u8725	m592	KEATON	This whole thing was a shakedown.
L635976	u8723	m592	FENSTER	Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
L635975	u8725	m592	KEATON	Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
L635974	u8723	m592	FENSTER	I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
L636403	u8723	m592	FENSTER	The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
L636402	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
L636396	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	They fucking know everything.
L636395	u8723	m592	FENSTER	Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
L636322	u8723	m592	FENSTER	RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
L636321	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
L636213	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	We all go. How about it, Keaton?
L636212	u8723	m592	FENSTER	Then who goes?
L636211	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
L635968	u8723	m592	FENSTER	Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
L635967	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	You are a criminal.
L635966	u8723	m592	FENSTER	You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
L636494	u8725	m592	KEATON	Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
L636493	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	Can we stealth these guys?
L636492	u8725	m592	KEATON	It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
L636458	u8725	m592	KEATON	Dig.
L636457	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
L635999	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	What do you care what he says?
L635998	u8725	m592	KEATON	Why don't you just calm down'
L635988	u8725	m592	KEATON	His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
L635987	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
L635986	u8725	m592	KEATON	He's alright.
L635971	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
L635970	u8725	m592	KEATON	You heard right.
L636498	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	If I'm going in, I want a stake.
L636497	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Did you hear what he just said?
L636496	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	Me too.
L636460	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	I can run. I got no problem with that.
L636459	u8732	m592	VERBAL	What are we gonna do?
L635990	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
L635989	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Roger really. People say I talk too much.
L635951	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
L635950	u8724	m592	HOCKNEY	I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
L636514	u8725	m592	KEATON	Just do what I tell you.
L636513	u8732	m592	VERBAL	What if I
L636512	u8725	m592	KEATON	I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
L636511	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Keaton, I can't just -
L636503	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Hungarian?
L636502	u8725	m592	KEATON	Russian, I think. I don't know.
L636501	u8732	m592	VERBAL	What-are they speaking?
L636372	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Who's Keyser Soze?
L636371	u8725	m592	KEATON	What is this?
L636314	u8725	m592	KEATON	Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
L636313	u8732	m592	VERBAL	What is it Keaton?
L636219	u8725	m592	KEATON	We'll make it.
L636218	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
L636217	u8725	m592	KEATON	We'll make it.
L636188	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Not if we do it my way.
L636187	u8725	m592	KEATON	No killing?
L636186	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Maybe more.
L636185	u8725	m592	KEATON	Three million?
L636184	u8732	m592	VERBAL	They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
L636183	u8725	m592	KEATON	Fenster and Hockney?
L636182	u8732	m592	VERBAL	McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
L636181	u8725	m592	KEATON	How are they going to do it?
L636180	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
L636179	u8725	m592	KEATON	Well, I'm sorry.
L636178	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I'11 be alright.
L636177	u8725	m592	KEATON	You okay?
L636176	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I was out of line.
L636174	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
L636173	u8725	m592	KEATON	You watch your mouth.
L636170	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
L636169	u8725	m592	KEATON	Tough break.
L636168	u8732	m592	VERBAL	They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
L636167	u8725	m592	KEATON	What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
L636166	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You have to come.
L636165	u8725	m592	KEATON	Never heard of him.
L636164	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
L636163	u8725	m592	KEATON	What fence? Who?
L636162	u8732	m592	VERBAL	McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
L636161	u8725	m592	KEATON	They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
L636158	u8725	m592	KEATON	Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
L636157	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Don't hurt me.
L636156	u8732	m592	VERBAL	If you'll just let me -
L636155	u8725	m592	KEATON	Get out.
L636144	u8732	m592	VERBAL	They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
L636143	u8725	m592	KEATON	I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
L636142	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
L636141	u8725	m592	KEATON	What the hell do you want?
L636136	u8725	m592	KEATON	Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
L636135	u8732	m592	VERBAL	How do you do?
L635994	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
L635993	u8725	m592	KEATON	You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
L635992	u8732	m592	VERBAL	County. I was in for fraud.
L635991	u8725	m592	KEATON	We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
L635960	u8725	m592	KEATON	Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
L635959	u8733	m592	VOICE	You know damn well, dead-man.
L635958	u8725	m592	KEATON	with what?
L635905	u8733	m592	VOICE	This I had to see myself.
L635904	u8725	m592	KEATON	Let's say for example -
L635870	u8725	m592	KEATON	What time is it?
L635869	u8733	m592	VOICE	Ready?
L635868	u8725	m592	KEATON	I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
L635867	u8733	m592	VOICE	How are you, Keaton?
L636487	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
L636486	u8725	m592	KEATON	You're lying.
L636485	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
L636484	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
L636483	u8725	m592	KEATON	What did you say?
L636481	u8725	m592	KEATON	We'll see.
L636480	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
L636478	u8725	m592	KEATON	Neither do we.
L636477	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
L636476	u8725	m592	KEATON	We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
L636475	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
L636474	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
L636473	u8725	m592	KEATON	Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
L636472	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	Mr. Soze will be most -
L636471	u8725	m592	KEATON	The answer is no.
L636384	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
L636383	u8725	m592	KEATON	What about Redfoot?
L636382	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
L636381	u8725	m592	KEATON	You set up the line-up.
L636370	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	I work for Keyser Sate.
L636369	u8725	m592	KEATON	Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
L636368	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
L636367	u8725	m592	KEATON	Who's your boss?
L636366	u8726	m592	KOBAYASHI	My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
L636339	u8725	m592	KEATON	Tell him we'll meet.
L636338	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
L636337	u8725	m592	KEATON	We want to meet him.
L636336	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
L636335	u8725	m592	KEATON	Who is he?
L636334	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
L636333	u8725	m592	KEATON	You didn't know.
L636332	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	Get a grip. I didn't know.
L636310	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
L636309	u8725	m592	KEATON	A little of both.
L636308	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	Business or personal?
L636307	u8725	m592	KEATON	Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
L636306	u8725	m592	KEATON	I shivved him.
L636305	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
L636304	u8725	m592	KEATON	A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
L636303	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
L636298	u8731	m592	REDFOOT	I've got a ton of work and no good people.
L636297	u8725	m592	KEATON	We're on vacation.
L636626	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Nothing. Something I - forget it.
L636625	u8729	m592	RAB IN	What?
L636624	u8728	m592	KUJAN	A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
L636623	u8729	m592	RAB IN	Waste of time.
L636622	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I'11 find him.
L636621	u8729	m592	RAB IN	Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
L636620	u8728	m592	KUJAN	No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
L636619	u8729	m592	RAB IN	Which is shit.
L636618	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
L636047	u8729	m592	RAB IN	Where?
L636046	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Someplace else, then.
L636045	u8729	m592	RAB IN	He won't go into the interrogation room.
L636041	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I want to see him.
L636040	u8729	m592	RAB IN	Two hours, tops.
L636039	u8728	m592	KUJAN	When does he post bail?
L636037	u8728	m592	KUJAN	What'the fuck is that?
L636036	u8729	m592	RAB IN	Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
L636035	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Did they charge him with anything?
L636034	u8729	m592	RAB IN	The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
L636033	u8728	m592	KUJAN	What do you mean I can't see him?
L636528	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Kobayashi.
L636527	u8730	m592	RABIN	His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
L636053	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
L636052	u8730	m592	RABIN	That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
L636051	u8728	m592	KUJAN	You know damn well what I think.
L636050	u8730	m592	RABIN	And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
L636049	u8728	m592	KUJAN	If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
L636048	u8730	m592	RABIN	No, no, no, no, no.
L636044	u8728	m592	KUJAN	This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
L636043	u8730	m592	RABIN	Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
L636613	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
L636612	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
L636611	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
L636610	u8728	m592	KUJAN	You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
L636609	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
L636608	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
L636607	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You think he's..?
L636606	u8728	m592	KUJAN	You're not safe on your own.
L636605	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
L636604	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Why lie about everything else, then?
L636603	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
L636602	u8732	m592	VERBAL	It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
L636601	u8728	m592	KUJAN	If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
L636598	u8728	m592	KUJAN	He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
L636597	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I knew him. He would never -
L636596	u8728	m592	KUJAN	He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
L636595	u8732	m592	VERBAL	This is all bullshit.
L636594	u8728	m592	KUJAN	He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
L636593	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Edie...
L636591	u8728	m592	KUJAN	THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
L636590	u8732	m592	VERBAL	NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
L636588	u8732	m592	VERBAL	NO.
L636587	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Keaton was Keyser Soze
L636586	u8732	m592	VERBAL	No...
L636585	u8728	m592	KUJAN	No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
L636584	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Because he was my friend.
L636583	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
L636582	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Edie.
L636581	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
L636580	u8732	m592	VERBAL	He wanted me to live.
L636579	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
L636577	u8732	m592	VERBAL	But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
L636576	u8728	m592	KUJAN	There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
L636575	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I don't
L636574	u8728	m592	KUJAN	But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
L636573	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I said I never heard of him.
L636572	u8728	m592	KUJAN	His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
L636571	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I never heard of him.
L636570	u8728	m592	KUJAN	He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
L636564	u8732	m592	VERBAL	It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
L636563	u8728	m592	KUJAN	But Keaton...
L636562	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
L636561	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Then why didn't you help him?
L636560	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
L636559	u8728	m592	KUJAN	YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
L636558	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I don't know what you're talking about.
L636557	u8728	m592	KUJAN	TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
L636556	u8728	m592	KUJAN	YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
L636555	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I don't.
L636554	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
L636552	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
L636551	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Wait a minute.
L636550	u8728	m592	KUJAN	A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
L636469	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
L636468	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Why didn't you say anything?
L636467	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
L636450	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
L636449	u8728	m592	KUJAN	What call?
L636448	u8732	m592	VERBAL	McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
L636447	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Then what?
L636445	u8728	m592	KUJAN	What happened?
L636444	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Give a guy a break, huh?
L636443	u8728	m592	KUJAN	You're stalling, Verbal.
L636442	u8732	m592	VERBAL	The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
L636441	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
L636440	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
L636439	u8728	m592	KUJAN	This is totally irrelevant.
L636438	u8732	m592	VERBAL	That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
L636430	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
L636429	u8728	m592	KUJAN	So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
L636428	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
L636427	u8728	m592	KUJAN	If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
L636426	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
L636425	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
L636424	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
L636423	u8728	m592	KUJAN	And this is why you never told the D.A.
L636422	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
L636415	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
L636414	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Do you believe in him, Verbal?
L636346	u8728	m592	KUJAN	And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
L636345	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Right.
L636344	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Came from Redfoot.
L636343	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Kobayashi.
L636342	u8728	m592	KUJAN	So this lawyer...
L636248	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
L636247	u8732	m592	VERBAL	No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
L636246	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Is he the one that killed Keaton?
L636245	u8732	m592	VERBAL	There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
L636244	u8728	m592	KUJAN	NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
L636243	u8732	m592	VERBAL	The D.A. gave me immunity.
L636242	u8728	m592	KUJAN	You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
L636239	u8728	m592	KUJAN	What lawyer?
L636238	u8732	m592	VERBAL	He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
L636237	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
L636236	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I don't know about that.
L636232	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
L636231	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You got him wrong.
L636230	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
L636229	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
L636228	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
L636227	u8732	m592	VERBAL	That was all Fenster and McManus.
L636226	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
L636225	u8732	m592	VERBAL	He loved her.
L636224	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
L636223	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
L636222	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
L636107	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I'm not a rat.
L636106	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
L636105	u8732	m592	VERBAL	No.
L636104	u8728	m592	KUJAN	The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
L636103	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
L636102	u8732	m592	VERBAL	There's nothing in there about Ruby.
L636100	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
L636099	u8732	m592	VERBAL	He didn't have my lawyer.
L636098	u8728	m592	KUJAN	You know Ruby is in Attica?
L636097	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You know a religious guy named John Paul?
L636096	u8728	m592	KUJAN	You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
L636095	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
L636094	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
L636093	u8732	m592	VERBAL	That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
L636092	u8728	m592	KUJAN	According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
L636090	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I just want to hear your story.
L636089	u8732	m592	VERBAL	You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
L636088	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Keaton was a piece of shit.
L636087	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
L636086	u8728	m592	KUJAN	He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
L636085	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I know he was good.
L636084	u8728	m592	KUJAN	I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
L636083	u8732	m592	VERBAL	I told the D.A. everything I know.
L636082	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
L636081	u8732	m592	VERBAL	Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
L636080	u8728	m592	KUJAN	Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
L636029	u8734	m592	VOICE #1	Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
L636028	u8735	m592	VOICE #2	Counselor, you're insulting me.
L636027	u8734	m592	VOICE #1	Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
L636026	u8735	m592	VOICE #2	You're joking.
L636025	u8734	m592	VOICE #1	Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
L636024	u8735	m592	VOICE #2	I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
L636021	u8734	m592	VOICE #1	Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
L636020	u8735	m592	VOICE #2	Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
L636019	u8734	m592	VOICE #1	Immunity.
L636018	u8735	m592	VOICE #2	May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
L636017	u8734	m592	VOICE #1	No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
L636016	u8735	m592	VOICE #2	The district attorney's office will comply provided -
L636015	u8734	m592	VOICE #1	My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
L639008	u8764	m594	MIDGE	I'll give you another complication: he still is.
L639007	u8758	m594	DOCTOR	Ah? That complicates the problem.
L639006	u8764	m594	MIDGE	I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
L639005	u8758	m594	DOCTOR	No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
L639004	u8764	m594	MIDGE	He won't talk.
L639003	u8758	m594	DOCTOR	It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
L639002	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
L638990	u8759	m594	ELSTER	No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
L638989	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I -- I --
L638988	u8759	m594	ELSTER	He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
L638659	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
L638658	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why did she never tell her daughter?
L638657	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
L638656	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
L638655	u8759	m594	ELSTER	She is not my wife.
L638654	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And when she goes to those places...
L638653	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Nothing.
L638652	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
L638651	u8759	m594	ELSTER	But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
L638650	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
L638649	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
L638648	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
L638647	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
L638646	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
L638645	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	But you knew about this.
L638644	u8759	m594	ELSTER	I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
L638643	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	There are things you didn't tell me.
L638642	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Yes.
L638641	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	That's Carlotta Valdes.
L638640	u8759	m594	ELSTER	You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
L638553	u8759	m594	ELSTER	All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
L638552	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Ernie's.
L638551	u8759	m594	ELSTER	We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
L638550	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How can I see her, to know her?
L638549	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
L638548	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	It's not my line.
L638547	u8759	m594	ELSTER	I want you.
L638546	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
L638545	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
L638544	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Have you talked to the doctors at all?
L638543	u8759	m594	ELSTER	The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
L638542	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well?
L638541	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
L638540	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where'd she go?
L638539	u8759	m594	ELSTER	More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
L638538	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How often does this happen?
L638537	u8759	m594	ELSTER	I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
L638536	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No.
L638535	u8759	m594	ELSTER	No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
L638534	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I didn't mean to be that rough.
L638533	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
L638532	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
L638531	u8759	m594	ELSTER	If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
L638530	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No.
L638529	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
L638528	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Someone dead.
L638527	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	From whom?
L638526	u8759	m594	ELSTER	I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
L638525	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Then?
L638524	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Not what you think. We're very happily married.
L638521	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	"No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the ""old college gang""; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?"
L638520	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Would you like a drink now?
L638519	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
L638518	u8759	m594	ELSTER	I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
L638517	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, I'm all right.
L638516	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Shouldn't you be sitting down?
L638515	u8759	m594	ELSTER	I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
L638514	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Like all this.
L638513	u8759	m594	ELSTER	San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
L638512	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And you like it.
L638511	u8759	m594	ELSTER	Almost a year.
L638510	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How long have you been back?
L638509	u8759	m594	ELSTER	No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
L638508	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You don't have to do it for a living.
L638507	u8759	m594	ELSTER	No, to be honest, I find it dull.
L638506	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Interesting business.
L638505	u8759	m594	ELSTER	I married into it.
L638504	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
L638735	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
L638734	u8760	m594	ELSTER'S VOICE	Did she hurt herself?
L638733	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Hello?
L638732	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	She... went into the Bay.
L638731	u8760	m594	ELSTER'S VOICE	What happened?
L638730	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
L638729	u8760	m594	ELSTER'S VOICE	Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
L638728	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Hello.
L639285	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
L639284	u8761	m594	JUDY	Love me... keep me safe...
L639283	u8761	m594	JUDY	I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
L639282	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I loved you, Madeleine.
L639281	u8761	m594	JUDY	What are you going to do?
L639280	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
L639279	u8761	m594	JUDY	Some money.
L639278	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
L639274	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
L639273	u8761	m594	JUDY	What are you going to do?
L639272	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I made it.
L639271	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	We'll find him.
L639270	u8761	m594	JUDY	I don't know... Switzerland?
L639269	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
L639268	u8761	m594	JUDY	Your accident...
L639267	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
L639266	u8761	m594	JUDY	Yes!
L639265	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
L639264	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
L639263	u8761	m594	JUDY	I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
L639262	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
L639261	u8761	m594	JUDY	Dead. He'd broken her neck.
L639260	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
L639259	u8761	m594	JUDY	Yes!
L639258	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
L639257	u8761	m594	JUDY	Scottie, please...!
L639256	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm going to. It's my second chance.
L639255	u8761	m594	JUDY	You can't. You're afraid!
L639254	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	We're going up the tower.
L639253	u8761	m594	JUDY	No! Let me go!
L639252	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
L639249	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
L639248	u8761	m594	JUDY	No!
L639247	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
L639246	u8761	m594	JUDY	Take me away...
L639245	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
L639238	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	"-- and wanted to go on loving you."" And I said, ""I won't lose you.""  But I did."
L639237	u8761	m594	JUDY	Scottie --
L639236	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	"...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, ""If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --"
L639234	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
L639233	u8761	m594	JUDY	I'm scared.
L639232	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
L639231	u8761	m594	JUDY	Why?
L639230	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I need you.
L639229	u8761	m594	JUDY	No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
L639228	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Madeleine died here.
L639227	u8761	m594	JUDY	But why? Why here?
L639226	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
L639225	u8761	m594	JUDY	Scottie, why are we here?
L639223	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	To complete my cure.
L639222	u8761	m594	JUDY	Where are you going?
L639221	u8761	m594	JUDY	No, it's all right.
L639220	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
L639219	u8761	m594	JUDY	We're going awfully far.
L639213	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Oh, yeah. There.
L639212	u8761	m594	JUDY	Can't you see?
L639211	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How does it work?
L639210	u8761	m594	JUDY	Scottie!
L639209	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	All in good time.
L639208	u8761	m594	JUDY	Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
L639207	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
L639205	u8761	m594	JUDY	I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
L639204	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, Ernie's is fine.
L639203	u8761	m594	JUDY	I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
L639202	u8761	m594	JUDY	Too late. I've got my face on.
L639201	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	That's what I had in mind.
L639200	u8761	m594	JUDY	Oh, no. You'll muss me.
L639199	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Come here.
L639198	u8761	m594	JUDY	Is that the best you can do?
L639197	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Mmmm.
L639195	u8761	m594	JUDY	"Well, after all, it's ""our place."""
L639194	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
L639193	u8761	m594	JUDY	Ernie's?
L639192	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Wherever you'd like...
L639191	u8761	m594	JUDY	Where shall we go for dinner?
L639188	u8761	m594	JUDY	We tried it. It didn't suit me.
L639187	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
L639186	u8761	m594	JUDY	Well?
L639177	u8761	m594	JUDY	All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
L639176	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes.
L639175	u8761	m594	JUDY	The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
L639174	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Judy, please it can't matter to you...
L639173	u8761	m594	JUDY	Ah, no!
L639172	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	The color of your hair...
L639170	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes. Yes, I do.
L639169	u8761	m594	JUDY	You don't even want to touch me.
L639168	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
L639167	u8761	m594	JUDY	I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
L639166	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
L639165	u8761	m594	JUDY	No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
L639164	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You can.
L639163	u8761	m594	JUDY	I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
L639147	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	We'll take it! Will it fit?
L639146	u8761	m594	JUDY	I don't like it!
L639143	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
L639142	u8761	m594	JUDY	No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
L639141	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
L639136	u8761	m594	JUDY	It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
L639135	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Judy --
L639134	u8761	m594	JUDY	Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
L639133	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
L639132	u8761	m594	JUDY	You want me to dress like her?
L639129	u8761	m594	JUDY	But why?
L639128	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	They're none of them right.
L639127	u8761	m594	JUDY	But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
L639126	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm trying to buy you a suit.
L639125	u8761	m594	JUDY	Scottie, what are you doing?
L639123	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, it's not right.
L639122	u8761	m594	JUDY	But I like that one, Scottie.
L639118	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I want to! Come on!
L639117	u8761	m594	JUDY	But Scottie, you don't have to!
L639116	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
L639115	u8761	m594	JUDY	Honest?
L639114	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
L639109	u8761	m594	JUDY	Yes --
L639108	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
L639107	u8761	m594	JUDY	I like that one.
L639105	u8761	m594	JUDY	I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
L639104	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Will you, Judy?
L639103	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Please! And don't look at me.
L639102	u8761	m594	JUDY	Why?!
L639101	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
L639099	u8761	m594	JUDY	That's not very complimentary, either.
L639098	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No.
L639097	u8761	m594	JUDY	Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
L639096	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes.
L639095	u8761	m594	JUDY	"As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd ""take care of me""?"
L639094	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I just want to see you as much as I can!
L639093	u8761	m594	JUDY	No? Then what?
L639092	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No.
L639091	u8761	m594	JUDY	Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
L639090	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, Judy, you don't understand.
L639089	u8761	m594	JUDY	Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
L639088	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'll take care of you.
L639087	u8761	m594	JUDY	And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
L639086	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Don't go.
L639085	u8761	m594	JUDY	Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
L639084	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Tomorrow morning.
L639083	u8761	m594	JUDY	Tomorrow night? Well --
L639082	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Can I see you tomorrow?
L639081	u8761	m594	JUDY	Thank you again. Good-night.
L639078	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Okay.
L639077	u8761	m594	JUDY	Mmm.
L639076	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	An hour?
L639075	u8761	m594	JUDY	Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
L639074	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
L639073	u8761	m594	JUDY	Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
L639072	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
L639071	u8761	m594	JUDY	Because I remind you of her?
L639070	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Just dinner.
L639069	u8761	m594	JUDY	Dinner... and what else?
L639068	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Then will you for me?
L639067	u8761	m594	JUDY	No, you don't owe me anything.
L639066	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
L639065	u8761	m594	JUDY	Why?
L639064	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Will you have dinner with me?
L639056	u8761	m594	JUDY	I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
L639055	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I want to know who you are.
L639054	u8761	m594	JUDY	Listen, what is this? What do you want?
L639053	u8761	m594	JUDY	Salina, Kansas!
L639052	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	But before! Where did you live before!?!
L639051	u8761	m594	JUDY	I told you! Right here!
L639050	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
L639049	u8761	m594	JUDY	About three years.
L639048	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	But you haven't lived here long.
L639047	u8761	m594	JUDY	It's a place to live, that's all.
L639046	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	-- and how you happen to be living here.
L639045	u8761	m594	JUDY	Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
L639044	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Who you are --
L639043	u8761	m594	JUDY	Judy Barton.
L639042	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Your name. And --
L639041	u8761	m594	JUDY	What do you want to know?
L639040	u8761	m594	JUDY	Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
L639039	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You won't have to.
L639038	u8761	m594	JUDY	I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
L639036	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Let me come in.
L639035	u8761	m594	JUDY	Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
L639034	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You're not far wrong.
L639033	u8761	m594	JUDY	I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
L639031	u8761	m594	JUDY	Why?
L639030	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You.
L639029	u8761	m594	JUDY	What about?
L639028	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Just let me talk to you.
L639027	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
L639026	u8761	m594	JUDY	Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
L639025	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
L639024	u8761	m594	JUDY	0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
L639023	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
L639022	u8761	m594	JUDY	Do you live here in the hotel?
L639021	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
L639020	u8761	m594	JUDY	Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
L639019	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	My name is John Ferguson, and --
L639018	u8761	m594	JUDY	What for? Who are you?
L639017	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Could I ask you a couple of questions?
L638975	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
L638974	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why?
L638973	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Let me go into the church alone.
L638972	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I won't lose you.
L638971	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
L638970	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes.
L638969	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	You believe that I love you?
L638968	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Madeleine!!
L638967	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Let me go! Let me go!!
L638966	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
L638965	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
L638963	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Please let me go.
L638962	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Madeleine --
L638961	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	To the church, I must go there.
L638960	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where?
L638959	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Let me go.
L638958	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why?
L638957	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	You can't.
L638956	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
L638953	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Too late... there's something I must do...
L638952	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No... we're together...
L638951	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I love you too... too late... too late...
L638950	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	My love... because I love you.
L638944	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
L638943	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Yes.
L638942	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And it's a all real.
L638941	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Here with you.
L638933	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
L638932	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
L638928	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
L638927	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
L638926	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, never!
L638925	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You've been there before. You've seen it.
L638924	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	It's all there. It's no dream.
L638923	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Yes?! But --
L638922	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
L638921	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
L638920	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Go on.
L638919	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
L638918	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Tell me.
L638917	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
L638916	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes --
L638915	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
L638914	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
L638912	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
L638911	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where's your husband?
L638909	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Only this far.
L638908	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, don't go away!
L638906	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I had the dream. The dream came back again...
L638905	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why? What's happened?
L638904	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
L638863	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	All the time.
L638862	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Don't leave me... stay with me...
L638861	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
L638860	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm here, I've got you...
L638859	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
L638857	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
L638856	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
L638855	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No!
L638854	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	But I'm the woman in the mirror!
L638853	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
L638852	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No.
L638851	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
L638850	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
L638849	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What else?
L638848	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
L638847	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	There's a name on the gravestone.
L638846	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I know.
L638845	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How do you know?
L638844	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
L638843	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where?
L638842	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	A grave...
L638841	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What else?
L638840	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No... it's in shadow.
L638839	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Would you know the room?
L638838	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
L638837	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What do you remember?
L638836	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Vaguely...
L638835	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
L638832	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yesterday.
L638831	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
L638830	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
L638829	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
L638826	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	...somewhere in the light.
L638825	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Home?
L638824	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Take me away from here?
L638823	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
L638822	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What?!
L638821	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, I can't tell you!
L638820	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What was it inside that told you to jump?
L638819	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No!
L638818	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why did you jump?
L638817	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
L638816	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
L638815	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, don't ask me!
L638814	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
L638813	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No!... No!
L638809	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where?
L638808	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Long ago...
L638807	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where were you born?
L638806	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	When?
L638805	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Yes...
L638804	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Have you been here before?
L638803	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	The tall trees...
L638802	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where?
L638801	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Here with you.
L638800	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where are you now?
L638798	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Madeleine!
L638797	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
L638796	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, thank you.
L638795	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Would you like a drink of water?
L638794	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No.
L638793	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No birds live here.
L638792	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	And no birds sing.
L638791	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Only silence. It's always like this.
L638790	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Do you hear anything?
L638787	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Knowing I have to die...
L638786	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why?
L638785	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I don't like them.
L638784	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
L638783	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
L638782	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What are you thinking?
L638780	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	The oldest living things?
L638779	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
L638778	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	How old?
L638777	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
L638776	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How can you be sure?
L638775	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
L638774	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Do you know where you're going?
L638771	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
L638770	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
L638769	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
L638768	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
L638767	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
L638766	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, I Just thought I'd wander.
L638765	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well... anywhere in particular?
L638764	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No.
L638763	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Shopping?
L638762	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I don't know.
L638760	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Good-bye.
L638759	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Good-bye.
L638758	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	We have.
L638757	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Meet again, sometime.
L638756	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	What?
L638755	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I hope we will, too.
L638754	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
L638753	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
L638752	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No! No, thank you!
L638751	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Would you like some coffee?
L638749	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I enjoyed talking to you.
L638748	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	-- talking to you...
L638747	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Not at all, I enjoyed --
L638746	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
L638745	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You've nothing to apologize for.
L638744	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
L638743	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
L638742	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I... suddenly felt such a fool.
L638741	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
L638740	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Oh! Yes. Hello.
L638726	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No... this is the first time for me, too.
L638725	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
L638724	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
L638723	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	What?
L638722	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
L638720	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No... it's wrong.
L638719	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Some people prefer it.
L638718	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	One shouldn't live alone.
L638717	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
L638716	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Wander about.
L638715	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
L638714	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
L638713	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
L638712	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
L638711	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
L638710	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	My name is John Ferguson.
L638709	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
L638708	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
L638707	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
L638706	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I... didn't know where you lived.
L638705	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
L638703	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Oh! Yes! Here!
L638702	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	When you...  There were pins in my hair...
L638701	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No.
L638700	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
L638699	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
L638698	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
L638696	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	You like it, too.
L638695	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Wandering about.
L638694	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
L638693	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
L638692	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
L638691	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Please drink your coffee.
L638689	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
L638688	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Oh... wandering about.
L638687	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	This afternoon.
L638686	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	When?
L638685	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where had you been before?
L638684	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
L638683	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Why?
L638682	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
L638681	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	At...
L638680	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Where were you?
L638679	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
L638678	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Do you remember where you were?
L638677	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	No...
L638676	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You don't remember.
L638668	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You...  ...fell into the Bay.
L638667	u8762	m594	MADELEINE	Why am I here? What happened?
L638585	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	What car?
L638584	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Her car is gone.
L638582	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
L638581	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Would you please go and look?
L638580	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
L638579	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
L638578	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
L638577	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
L638576	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
L638575	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
L638574	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Does she sleep here? Ever?
L638573	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
L638572	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How long has she had the room?
L638571	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
L638570	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Carlotta Valdes?
L638569	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
L638568	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What is her name?
L638567	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
L638566	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Please answer my question.
L638565	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
L638564	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
L638563	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
L638562	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Oh, yes!
L638561	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes... you run this hotel.
L638560	u8763	m594	MANAGERESS	Is there something I can do for you?
L638894	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Oh?
L638893	u8764	m594	MIDGE	As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
L638892	u8764	m594	MIDGE	No, not exactly. Want to see?
L638891	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What is it, a still life?
L638890	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
L638889	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
L638888	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
L638886	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Wandering.
L638885	u8764	m594	MIDGE	What have you been doing?
L638884	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Naturally.
L638883	u8764	m594	MIDGE	If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
L638882	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What I've been doing?
L638881	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Oh... this and that.
L638880	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
L638879	u8764	m594	MIDGE	I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
L638878	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well, I detected an undercurrent.
L638877	u8764	m594	MIDGE	"All I said in the note was: ""Where are you?"" That doesn't sound desperate to me."
L638876	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What was this desperate urge to see me?
L638875	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Oh?
L638874	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yeah.
L638873	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Did you need it?
L638872	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Mm. Better.
L638871	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Oh?
L638870	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Around.
L638869	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Where?
L638868	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Just wander.
L638867	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
L638866	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
L638639	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Bye-bye!
L638638	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Midge!
L638636	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Mmm, yeah, I guess...
L638635	u8764	m594	MIDGE	No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
L638634	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Carlotta?
L638633	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Is she pretty?
L638632	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Think?  Well, what do you think?
L638631	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
L638630	u8764	m594	MIDGE	And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
L638629	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Out!
L638628	u8764	m594	MIDGE	I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
L638627	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Out. I've got things to do.
L638626	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Who's the guy, who's the wife?
L638625	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I've told you enough.
L638624	u8764	m594	MIDGE	You haven't told me everything.
L638623	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Here you are.
L638621	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'll take you home.
L638620	u8764	m594	MIDGE	You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
L638619	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Nothing to tell.
L638618	u8764	m594	MIDGE	For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
L638617	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	For what?
L638616	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
L638610	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And she died...
L638609	u8764	m594	MIDGE	The poor thing....
L638600	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
L638599	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Pop Leibel? Sure.
L638598	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Do you know him well?
L638597	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
L638596	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
L638595	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
L638594	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Who?
L638593	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Pop Leibel.
L638592	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yeah.
L638591	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
L638590	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
L638589	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
L638588	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
L638587	u8764	m594	MIDGE	"Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this ""hello you look wonderful"" stuff. Just a good straight ""who do you know"" --"
L638503	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
L638502	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Johnny!
L638501	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
L638500	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Easy, now.
L638498	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Okay.
L638497	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Step number two.
L638495	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
L638494	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
L638493	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
L638492	u8764	m594	MIDGE	That!?!
L638491	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
L638490	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
L638489	u8764	m594	MIDGE	How?
L638488	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I think I can lick it.
L638487	u8764	m594	MIDGE	I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
L638486	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	My... the acrophobia.
L638485	u8764	m594	MIDGE	What.
L638484	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
L638483	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Sorry, old man. Work.
L638482	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
L638481	u8764	m594	MIDGE	He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
L638480	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Could be.
L638479	u8764	m594	MIDGE	That's Skid Row... isn't it?
L638478	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
L638477	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
L638476	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
L638475	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Three whole weeks.
L638474	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
L638473	u8764	m594	MIDGE	You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
L638472	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Aren't you ever going to get married?
L638471	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Normal.
L638470	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well?
L638469	u8764	m594	MIDGE	That's following a train of thought.
L638468	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How's your love life, Midge?
L638467	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What a pleasant hobby.
L638466	u8764	m594	MIDGE	An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
L638465	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Uh-huh!
L638464	u8764	m594	MIDGE	It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
L638463	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I've never run across one like that.
L638462	u8764	m594	MIDGE	It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
L638460	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Oh!
L638459	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	From that music.
L638458	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I'm having one now.
L638457	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
L638456	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
L638455	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
L638454	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
L638453	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Well?... what'll you do?
L638452	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Ah, Johnny-O...
L638451	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
L638450	u8764	m594	MIDGE	It's where you belong.
L638449	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
L638448	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
L638447	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
L638446	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Johnny, the doctors explained --
L638445	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I know. Everybody tells me.
L638444	u8764	m594	MIDGE	It wasn't your fault.
L638443	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
L638442	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Why?
L638441	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	I had to quit, Midge.
L638440	u8764	m594	MIDGE	No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
L638439	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	You sound so disapproving, Midge.
L638438	u8764	m594	MIDGE	What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
L638437	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What do you mean?
L638436	u8764	m594	MIDGE	Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
L638435	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How do you know? Personal experience?
L638434	u8764	m594	MIDGE	More than you think.
L638433	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
L638432	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
L638431	u8764	m594	MIDGE	What's tomorrow?
L638430	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
L638429	u8764	m594	MIDGE	No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
L638428	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
L638427	u8764	m594	MIDGE	I thought you said no more aches and pains?
L638426	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Ow!!
L638614	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
L638613	u8765	m594	POP LEIBEL	By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
L638612	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How?
L638611	u8765	m594	POP LEIBEL	She died.
L638607	u8765	m594	POP LEIBEL	By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
L638606	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	By whom?
L638605	u8765	m594	POP LEIBEL	It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
L638604	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
L638603	u8765	m594	POP LEIBEL	Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
L639153	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
L639152	u8766	m594	SALESWOMAN	Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
L639151	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Can we have it by tonight?
L639150	u8766	m594	SALESWOMAN	Well...
L639149	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	How soon can it be altered?
L639148	u8766	m594	SALESWOMAN	Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
L639145	u8766	m594	SALESWOMAN	I thought so!
L639144	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Yes! That's it!
L639138	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
L639137	u8766	m594	SALESWOMAN	She'll be out in a moment.
L639121	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
L639120	u8766	m594	SALESWOMAN	But you said grey, sir.
L639119	u8767	m594	SCOTTIE	No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
L648533	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Then we both are.
L648532	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
L648531	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648530	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	No.  But once I heard...
L648529	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Did you?
L648528	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	A ghost?
L648527	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I started seeing things.
L648526	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	What do you mean?
L648525	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
L648524	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	So much.
L648523	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I miss you.
L648522	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
L648521	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Are you mad at me?
L648520	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	I know he does.
L648519	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He loves you very much.  He just--
L648518	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
L648517	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's not true.
L648516	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	"I think playing in a band called ""Bitch"" might put a dent in the whole ""perfect family"" thing."
L648515	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, he wouldn't.
L648514	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Besides, Dad would have freaked.
L648512	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why?
L648511	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
L648510	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That was very good.
L647966	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
L647965	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of course you will.
L647964	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	I'll come back all the time.
L647963	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I know that.
L647962	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	It's only two hours away.
L647961	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes?
L647960	u8858	m601	CAITLIN	Hey.
L647959	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Do you have a scarf?
L648459	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	"No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of ""empty-nest"" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist."
L648458	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	That can't feel good.
L648457	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
L648456	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	What?
L648452	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
L648451	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	You were in an accident?
L648450	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
L648449	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Have you been hurt?
L648448	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
L648447	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	What do you think?  Guess.
L648446	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.
L648445	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Do you?
L648444	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	"She said, ""You know.""  That I know."
L648442	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
L648441	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	You're saying you willed these events to happen?
L648440	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
L648439	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	You think you influenced her?
L648438	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Isn't there something called group hysteria?
L648437	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Your friend saw them.
L648436	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes, but...
L648435	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
L648434	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Well, that's what we're here for.
L648433	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What's happening to me?
L648361	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
L648360	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	How?
L648359	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Nope.
L648358	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Are you humoring me?
L648357	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
L648356	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You think that'll help?
L648355	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Try to communicate with her somehow.
L648354	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648352	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What do you think I should do?
L648351	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Fine.
L648350	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
L648349	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Do you have any idea who she is?
L648348	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Pretty.  She's a blond.
L648347	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	What does she look like?
L648346	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
L648345	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	How do you know it's a she?
L648344	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
L648342	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Mm-hmm.
L648341	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	These are good.
L648336	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're joking.
L648335	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Fireball?
L648334	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
L648333	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Why is he worried?
L648332	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.
L648331	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Do you really think so?
L648330	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
L648329	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Your husband?
L648328	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Because he was worried about me.
L648327	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Then why did you?
L648326	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I didn't want to come.
L648325	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
L648324	u8860	m601	DR. DRAYTON	Who's idea was it?
L648582	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	The wives.
L648581	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Who's that?
L648580	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
L648579	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
L648578	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Toward the end.  You remember?
L648577	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	At the party.
L648576	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
L648575	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
L648574	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
L648573	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
L648572	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Uh-huh.  What can be?
L648571	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	I know how hard it can be sometimes.
L648570	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm sorry?
L648569	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
L648568	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Almost.
L648567	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
L648566	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
L648565	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	How're you holding up?
L648538	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
L648537	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I am.
L648536	u8866	m601	MRS. TEMPLETON	Of course.  You must be so proud.
L648428	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	I didn't kill my wife.
L648427	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Give me that shit.  Your wife.
L648426	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	Who?
L648194	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	I have to go.
L648193	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh-kay...
L648192	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	I don't know.
L648191	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	When...when will she be back?
L648190	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	She isn't here.
L648189	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Well maybe your wife...
L648188	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	This really isn't a good time.
L648187	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
L648186	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
L648185	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...
L648184	u8863	m601	MR. FEUR	Yes?
L648484	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
L648483	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  No, I don't.
L648482	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	You must think I'm pathetic.
L648481	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
L648480	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...sure.
L648479	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
L648478	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648477	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Love.
L648475	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
L648474	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
L648473	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	No.
L648470	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
L648469	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Thank you.
L648468	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Your house is so beautiful.
L648467	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Very much.
L648466	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Would you like some iced tea?
L648465	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Right.  I'm sorry.
L648464	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	And then you weren't there.
L648463	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
L648462	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You do?
L648461	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I wanted to apologize.
L648043	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wait!  Don't go...
L648042	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
L648041	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
L648040	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	This fence...it's so...
L648039	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
L648038	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I've never even met you.
L648037	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's not...It's not like that.
L648036	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
L648035	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tell me.  I can help you.
L648034	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
L648033	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tell me.  Please.
L648032	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I can't, no, no, I can't...
L648031	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?  What are you afraid of?
L648030	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
L648029	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Who?  Your husband?
L648028	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
L648027	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I'm not...
L648026	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hello?
L648025	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Is everything alright?
L648024	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	I've seen you.  From the window.
L648023	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Um...yes.
L648022	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	You're the flower lady.
L648021	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
L648020	u8864	m601	MRS. FEUR	Who are you?
L648659	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
L648658	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What was her major?
L648657	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of course.
L648656	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
L648655	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I should be going anyway.
L648654	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	They're calling me in to work.
L648651	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You must have been very proud.
L648650	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
L648648	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
L648647	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.
L648646	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Why are you here?
L648644	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
L648643	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She never mentioned her father.
L648642	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
L648641	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
L648640	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	You look a little old for a student.
L648639	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's fine.
L648638	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
L648635	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	She never mentioned you.
L648634	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Claire.
L648633	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	What's your name?
L648630	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Please leave me alone.
L648629	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, I don't.
L648628	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	You know where she is?
L648627	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
L648626	u8865	m601	MRS. FRANK	Yeah.
L648625	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mrs. Frank?
L648305	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
L648304	u8861	m601	ELENA	She got it.  Turned it down.
L648302	u8861	m601	ELENA	I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
L648301	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She's making this up.
L648300	u8861	m601	ELENA	And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
L648299	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Do we have to?
L648298	u8861	m601	ELENA	We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
L648297	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Stop.
L648296	u8861	m601	ELENA	You should have heard her play.
L648293	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh God...
L648292	u8861	m601	ELENA	And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
L648291	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We were suite mates.
L648290	u8861	m601	ELENA	I came in from my room...
L648289	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He was so pissed.
L648288	u8861	m601	ELENA	...just so she could cut them off.
L648287	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I didn't sleep with him.
L648286	u8861	m601	ELENA	Anyway, Claire slept with him...
L648285	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He looked like one of the Monkees.
L648282	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We know each other.
L648281	u8861	m601	ELENA	This is...
L648280	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wow.
L648805	u8862	m601	JODY	Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
L648804	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know...
L648803	u8862	m601	JODY	You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
L648802	u8862	m601	JODY	He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
L648801	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I guess not.
L648800	u8862	m601	JODY	What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
L648799	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody he was lying.
L648798	u8862	m601	JODY	Did he say that?
L648797	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
L648770	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What is it?
L648769	u8862	m601	JODY	I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
L648768	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Like what?
L648767	u8862	m601	JODY	Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
L648766	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
L648765	u8862	m601	JODY	We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
L648764	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I can't believe this is happening.
L648763	u8862	m601	JODY	I know.
L648762	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, she tried to kill him.
L648750	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
L648749	u8862	m601	JODY	You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
L648748	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
L648747	u8862	m601	JODY	If she was dangerous before--
L648746	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.
L648745	u8862	m601	JODY	What are you going to do?
L648744	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
L648743	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.
L648742	u8862	m601	JODY	I'm a terrible friend.
L648741	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	All of us.
L648740	u8862	m601	JODY	I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
L648739	u8862	m601	JODY	Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
L648738	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
L648737	u8862	m601	JODY	By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
L648736	u8862	m601	JODY	I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
L648735	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Relieved?
L648734	u8862	m601	JODY	Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
L648733	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why?
L648732	u8862	m601	JODY	I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
L648731	u8862	m601	JODY	Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
L648730	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Adamant?
L648729	u8862	m601	JODY	I was down in Adamant...
L648728	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh God...you knew.
L648564	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
L648563	u8862	m601	JODY	Okay.  Okay.
L648562	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Please.
L648561	u8862	m601	JODY	But Claire--
L648560	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
L648559	u8862	m601	JODY	And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
L648558	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hartford?
L648557	u8862	m601	JODY	Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
L648556	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Did I?
L648555	u8862	m601	JODY	Something was there.  You saw it.
L648554	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
L648553	u8862	m601	JODY	Then what was it?
L648552	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
L648551	u8862	m601	JODY	What?
L648550	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, she's alive.
L648549	u8862	m601	JODY	Does Norman know?
L648548	u8862	m601	JODY	I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
L648547	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's alright.
L648546	u8862	m601	JODY	I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
L648545	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I think so
L648544	u8862	m601	JODY	Are you okay?
L648389	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, wait.
L648388	u8862	m601	JODY	I have to go.
L648383	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
L648382	u8862	m601	JODY	Mef?  What's Mef?
L648381	u8862	m601	JODY	M-E...
L648380	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh...
L648375	u8862	m601	JODY	Shhh.
L648374	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing's happening.
L648371	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.
L648370	u8862	m601	JODY	We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
L648369	u8862	m601	JODY	This.
L648368	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	The planchette?
L648367	u8862	m601	JODY	Place your fingers on the planchette.
L648364	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
L648363	u8862	m601	JODY	Sit down here.
L648218	u8862	m601	JODY	No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
L648217	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wow.  I'm losing it.
L648215	u8862	m601	JODY	I don't...
L648214	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	In the window.  Norman's at work.
L648213	u8862	m601	JODY	What?
L648212	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Someone's there.
L648209	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Please.  That's all I need.
L648208	u8862	m601	JODY	Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
L648207	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...no...no...no...
L648206	u8862	m601	JODY	Telling you...
L648205	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody, no...
L648204	u8862	m601	JODY	Seance.
L648203	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648202	u8862	m601	JODY	Know what I think?
L648199	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
L648198	u8862	m601	JODY	You think he killed her?
L648101	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You got it.
L648100	u8862	m601	JODY	Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
L648099	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Absolutely.
L648098	u8862	m601	JODY	Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
L648097	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's niiice.
L648096	u8862	m601	JODY	Yep.
L648095	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh my god.  You bought it.
L648094	u8862	m601	JODY	So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
L648093	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Thanks, but I'm fine.
L648092	u8862	m601	JODY	She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
L648091	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're discussing me with your psychic?
L648090	u8862	m601	JODY	It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
L648089	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody--
L648088	u8862	m601	JODY	Kambucha mushroom tea...
L648087	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What is it?
L648086	u8862	m601	JODY	Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
L648085	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
L648084	u8862	m601	JODY	Well good.  So you're human.
L648083	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Okay, I'm a little tender.
L648082	u8862	m601	JODY	Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
L648081	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why does everyone find that so surprising?
L648080	u8862	m601	JODY	You are?
L648079	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Good.  I'm good.
L648078	u8862	m601	JODY	How you holding up?
L648842	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	MADISON!
L648841	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648840	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mauduh...
L648839	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Shhhh.
L648838	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mmmuh...
L648821	u8867	m601	NORMAN	IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
L648820	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't believe you.
L648819	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
L648818	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
L648817	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
L648816	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
L648811	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
L648810	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I know.
L648809	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You don't have to do that.
L648808	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm cooking you dinner.
L648807	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing.
L648806	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What's that for?
L648795	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
L648794	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Don't think so.
L648793	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Do you know it?
L648792	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Huh.
L648791	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
L648790	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648789	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Adamant.
L648788	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
L648787	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Look for antiques...
L648786	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
L648785	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	The leaves...
L648781	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire...
L648780	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
L648779	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How can you be sure?
L648778	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She can't be here without me.
L648777	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648776	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She's gone.
L648775	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
L648774	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's alright.
L648773	u8867	m601	NORMAN	We have to get out of here.
L648723	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
L648722	u8867	m601	NORMAN	We don't know that for sure.
L648721	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She did it.
L648718	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	How did she know where it was?
L648717	u8867	m601	NORMAN	She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
L648711	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Get out of my way.
L648710	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire...
L648709	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You should have tried harder.
L648708	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I tried to break it off!
L648707	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm not going to listen to this.
L648706	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
L648705	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Stop...
L648704	u8867	m601	NORMAN	And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
L648703	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Leave her out of this!
L648702	u8867	m601	NORMAN	To Caitlin!!
L648701	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Who?
L648700	u8867	m601	NORMAN	THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
L648699	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
L648698	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I never asked you to quit!
L648697	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
L648696	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, please don't...
L648693	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
L648692	u8867	m601	NORMAN	That's not what I'm sayi--
L648691	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	So you fucked a student?!
L648690	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It was last year.  We were having troubles.
L648689	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
L648688	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Oh God...
L648687	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
L648686	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire--
L648685	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I was there.
L648684	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648683	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You know...
L648681	u8867	m601	NORMAN	STOP IT!
L648680	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Your wife...
L648679	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Who?
L648678	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I think she's starting to suspect something.
L648677	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
L648676	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I don't like this, this...
L648675	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Since when?
L648674	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's too rough.
L648673	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What's the matter?
L648672	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Ow!
L648669	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wouldn't go that far.
L648668	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I take it your not mad at me.
L648619	u8867	m601	NORMAN	STOP IT!
L648618	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's Madison Fra--
L648617	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...Please stop...
L648616	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...I'm positive this time...
L648615	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Stop...
L648614	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
L648613	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes.  The ghost.
L648612	u8867	m601	NORMAN	The...
L648611	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
L648610	u8867	m601	NORMAN	No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
L648609	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Not personally.
L648608	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I may have seen her on campus.
L648596	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What's wrong with me?
L648595	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
L648594	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But I don't remember.
L648593	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
L648592	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
L648591	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
L648590	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	In the living room...
L648589	u8867	m601	NORMAN	A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
L648588	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I...
L648587	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You dropped a glass.
L648586	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
L648585	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You don't remember?
L648500	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You told me that I was...
L648499	u8867	m601	NORMAN	We walked all night...
L648498	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I felt you...looking through me...
L648497	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
L648496	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
L648495	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You know I am.
L648494	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Are you glad?  I'm glad.
L648493	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648491	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Call ya later.
L648490	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yep.
L648489	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Do I have everything?
L648488	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Really big bed.
L648487	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
L648486	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
L648430	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Then where is she?
L648429	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm sorry...
L648420	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, please...
L648419	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
L648418	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I will NOT.
L648417	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Keep your voice down.
L648414	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
L648413	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Sweetheart--
L648412	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
L648411	u8867	m601	NORMAN	But then you've been so much better...
L648410	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	The accident...?
L648409	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
L648408	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Sabotage?
L648407	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
L648406	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What are you...?  No.
L648405	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
L648404	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?
L648402	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
L648401	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How did you--
L648400	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
L648399	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Who did?
L648398	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We had a seance.
L648397	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How do you know this?
L648396	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
L648395	u8867	m601	NORMAN	This is the Feur thing?
L648394	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
L648393	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What are you doing out here?
L648323	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
L648322	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Are you lonely?
L648321	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
L648320	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I never said...
L648319	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	"I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some ""symptom"" of something..."
L648318	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
L648315	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What can it hurt to talk to someone?
L648314	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman...
L648313	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Harvey says he's amazing.
L648312	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't need a shrink.
L648272	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Well, that's a relief.
L648271	u8867	m601	NORMAN	There we go.
L648270	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We're going to be fine.
L648269	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
L648268	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're not at the center.
L648267	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Five minutes?
L648266	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
L648265	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What are you doing?
L648264	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
L648263	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...like it never even happened...
L648262	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	...Don't get all...
L648261	u8867	m601	NORMAN	When you do this, I swear...
L648259	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
L648258	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tonight?
L648257	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
L648256	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh.
L648255	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
L648254	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	When?
L648253	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
L648252	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Dressed?
L648251	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
L648250	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
L648249	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
L648248	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Maybe.  Point is...not me.
L648247	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
L648246	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I didn't do that.
L648245	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What am I looking at?
L648244	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	See?
L648243	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
L648242	u8867	m601	NORMAN	She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
L648241	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Where is she then?
L648236	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's a ghost.
L648235	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
L648234	u8867	m601	NORMAN	From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
L648233	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	A flare?
L648232	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's a flare.
L648231	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  Look!  In the window.
L648230	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Our house.
L648229	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
L648228	u8867	m601	NORMAN	And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
L648227	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
L648226	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What?
L648225	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	He killed her.
L648223	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Shhhh.
L648222	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What's going on, Claire?
L648221	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Get down!  He'll see.
L648178	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Huh.
L648177	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
L648176	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Did you call about the Feurs?
L648175	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Sorry.  You understand.
L648172	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
L648171	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You didn't?
L648170	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What?  No.  No.
L648169	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did you tell her?
L648168	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
L648167	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
L648166	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm so sorry.
L648165	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...for my father.
L648164	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's...
L648163	u8867	m601	NORMAN	"...of Perpetual Distances.  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  ""I'm afraid you've mistaken me,""  I say..."
L648162	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh, no...
L648161	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...especially Spencer's Theorem...
L648160	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Well, that's nice.
L648159	u8867	m601	NORMAN	"And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, ""Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."""
L648158	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Wow.
L648157	u8867	m601	NORMAN	He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
L648156	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You're kidding.
L648155	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
L648154	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You know what that does to me.
L648153	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
L648152	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Yep.
L648151	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	You are so brilliant.
L648150	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I think so.  Maybe.
L648149	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Really?
L648148	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Think I may have cracked it.
L648147	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
L648146	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
L648141	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I don't know.  Just...whispering.
L648140	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What kind of whispering?
L648139	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
L648138	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Of course.
L648137	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
L648136	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did you call the police?
L648135	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	In the house.  I was scared.
L648134	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What do you mean?  Some noises where?
L648133	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
L648132	u8867	m601	NORMAN	What are you doing here?
L648113	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
L648112	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire?
L648110	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	No, no.  It's fine.
L648109	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Unless you need me to come home...
L648108	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Oh.
L648107	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
L648106	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hi.
L648075	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Is it gone?
L648074	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
L648071	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Hurry...
L648070	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Mmnph.
L648069	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman, you have to look at this!
L648066	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Promise?
L648065	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
L648064	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I just wish you could have heard her.
L648063	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's what I've been working for.
L648062	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I know.
L648061	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
L648060	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'd never be able to live with mysel--
L648059	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire...
L648058	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	But what if something happens?
L648057	u8867	m601	NORMAN	...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
L648056	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	That's not what I'm sug--
L648055	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
L648054	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	To make sure she's all right.
L648053	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Why?
L648052	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
L648051	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Remember how we were?
L648050	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
L648049	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
L648048	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	More or less.
L648047	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did she say that?
L648046	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Of him I think.
L648045	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Of what?
L648014	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'll be there.
L648013	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	After that.
L648012	u8867	m601	NORMAN	I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
L648011	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Tomorrow.
L648010	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Maybe we should just...
L648009	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Mmm.
L648008	u8867	m601	NORMAN	And we moved out here for the quiet.
L648004	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Shhh.
L648003	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Did you...
L648002	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yup.
L648001	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Wanna fool around?
L648000	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Nope.
L647999	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Tired?
L647998	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I know.
L647997	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's just us now.
L647996	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	We did.
L647995	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
L647994	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
L647993	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You are...
L647992	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
L647991	u8867	m601	NORMAN	You know what I mean.
L647990	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Not the focus.
L647989	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's just she's been the focus for a while.
L647988	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I am, really.
L647987	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's okay if you're not.
L647986	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Fine.
L647985	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How are you?
L647984	u8867	m601	NORMAN	No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
L647983	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	If you have to work...
L647982	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Nice.  Almost done.
L647981	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
L647980	u8867	m601	NORMAN	How is it?
L647979	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
L647978	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Whatcha reading?
L647957	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Three o'clock.
L647956	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire?
L647954	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Yep.
L647953	u8867	m601	NORMAN	It's today?
L647951	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	It's Saturday.
L647950	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Claire, I have to show up for the--
L647949	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Don't.
L647948	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
L647947	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	Norman Spencer.
L647946	u8867	m601	NORMAN	When's she out of here?
L647944	u8867	m601	NORMAN	We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
L647943	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	She's awake.
L647942	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
L647941	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	What's their name?
L647940	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Three weeks.
L647939	u8859	m601	CLAIRE	I think three...
L647938	u8867	m601	NORMAN	Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
L655070	u8906	m606	ART	I... You know... I...
L655069	u8916	m606	SAM	How you doing, Artie?
L654862	u8906	m606	ART	The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
L654861	u8916	m606	SAM	That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
L654860	u8906	m606	ART	All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
L654859	u8916	m606	SAM	This is insane.
L654858	u8906	m606	ART	Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
L654857	u8916	m606	SAM	... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
L654856	u8906	m606	ART	Kelly Van Ryan...
L654855	u8916	m606	SAM	Talk to me Artie.
L654690	u8916	m606	SAM	I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
L654689	u8906	m606	ART	So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
L655226	u8916	m606	SAM	I'd like that.
L655225	u8907	m606	BARBARA	I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
L655224	u8916	m606	SAM	I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
L655223	u8907	m606	BARBARA	And where might that be?
L655222	u8916	m606	SAM	Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
L655219	u8907	m606	BARBARA	Thanks.
L655218	u8916	m606	SAM	You look pretty.
L654747	u8916	m606	SAM	Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
L654746	u8907	m606	BARBARA	She's going to wash your Jeep?
L654745	u8916	m606	SAM	Kelly.
L654744	u8907	m606	BARBARA	Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
L654737	u8916	m606	SAM	Eat a power bar.
L654736	u8907	m606	BARBARA	Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
L655305	u8914	m606	RAY	Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
L655304	u8908	m606	DAVE	Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
L655303	u8914	m606	RAY	What about the blood?
L655302	u8908	m606	DAVE	Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
L655301	u8914	m606	RAY	The teeth doin' any talkin'?
L655300	u8908	m606	DAVE	Merritt, Forensics.
L655289	u8908	m606	DAVE	We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
L655288	u8914	m606	RAY	How soon can we get something?
L655432	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I'm fine.  Nice TV.
L655431	u8915	m606	RUBY	You okay?
L655429	u8915	m606	RUBY	And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
L655428	u8909	m606	GLORIA	So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
L655427	u8915	m606	RUBY	Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
L655426	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
L655425	u8915	m606	RUBY	She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
L655424	u8909	m606	GLORIA	And the child...
L655423	u8915	m606	RUBY	Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
L655387	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Was there ever any kind of investigation...
L655386	u8915	m606	RUBY	No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
L655385	u8909	m606	GLORIA	She still work there?
L655384	u8915	m606	RUBY	Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
L655383	u8915	m606	RUBY	He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
L655382	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
L655381	u8915	m606	RUBY	About Suzie?
L655380	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
L655379	u8915	m606	RUBY	You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
L655378	u8915	m606	RUBY	Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
L655377	u8909	m606	GLORIA	What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
L655376	u8915	m606	RUBY	Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
L654834	u8912	m606	KELLY	"I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, ""Don't worry, I didn't come."" I can't forget that.  He said, ""No little girl can ever make me come."""
L654833	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Try, Kelly.
L654832	u8912	m606	KELLY	Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
L654831	u8909	m606	GLORIA	You mean he withdrew...
L654830	u8912	m606	KELLY	"He kept saying, ""Let it happen, let it happen.""  Then he just stopped."
L654829	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Then what?
L654828	u8912	m606	KELLY	I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
L654827	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Did you try to fight him?
L654826	u8909	m606	GLORIA	He was large?
L654825	u8912	m606	KELLY	No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
L654824	u8909	m606	GLORIA	That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
L654823	u8912	m606	KELLY	Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
L654822	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
L654821	u8912	m606	KELLY	"He said something like, ""Do you want it dirty7"" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor."
L654820	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I understand.
L654819	u8912	m606	KELLY	They were in me.  Both places... you know.
L654818	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Take your time.
L654817	u8912	m606	KELLY	The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
L654813	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I know you do.
L654812	u8912	m606	KELLY	I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
L654811	u8909	m606	GLORIA	How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
L655332	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Suzie?
L655331	u8916	m606	SAM	Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
L655327	u8909	m606	GLORIA	You could tell me where you were last night.
L655326	u8916	m606	SAM	I don't know what to say...
L655325	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Ray thinks she was murdered.
L655324	u8916	m606	SAM	Maybe she used another name.
L655323	u8909	m606	GLORIA	She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
L655322	u8916	m606	SAM	How long?
L655321	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Suzie Toller is missing.
L655320	u8916	m606	SAM	Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
L654920	u8916	m606	SAM	There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
L654919	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Weren't you a little worried about her...?
L654918	u8916	m606	SAM	No.
L654917	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
L654914	u8916	m606	SAM	Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
L654913	u8909	m606	GLORIA	And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
L654694	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I'd like that.
L654693	u8916	m606	SAM	If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
L655342	u8909	m606	GLORIA	It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
L655341	u8914	m606	RAY	The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
L655340	u8909	m606	GLORIA	He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
L655339	u8914	m606	RAY	Where's Lombardo?
L655338	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
L655299	u8914	m606	RAY	If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
L655298	u8909	m606	GLORIA	And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
L655297	u8914	m606	RAY	Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
L655296	u8914	m606	RAY	What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
L655295	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Ray, you heard him...
L655294	u8914	m606	RAY	Will you do me one favor?
L655291	u8909	m606	GLORIA	We don't know that, Ray...
L655290	u8914	m606	RAY	Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
L655286	u8914	m606	RAY	You don't think Sam could've put it there?
L655285	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
L655284	u8914	m606	RAY	The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
L655283	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Where's the body?
L655282	u8914	m606	RAY	Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
L655281	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
L655262	u8914	m606	RAY	Just check out the car.
L655261	u8909	m606	GLORIA	If you want company...
L655260	u8909	m606	GLORIA	You have someplace to be?
L655259	u8914	m606	RAY	I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
L655258	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
L655257	u8914	m606	RAY	It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
L655217	u8914	m606	RAY	I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
L655216	u8909	m606	GLORIA	We all have...
L655215	u8914	m606	RAY	Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
L655214	u8909	m606	GLORIA	You could say that.
L655213	u8914	m606	RAY	Guess I kind of lost it there.
L655206	u8914	m606	RAY	What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
L655205	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
L655126	u8914	m606	RAY	I net a guy in a bar.
L655125	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
L655124	u8914	m606	RAY	You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
L655123	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Eliminate the competition.
L655122	u8914	m606	RAY	I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
L655121	u8909	m606	GLORIA	This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
L655120	u8914	m606	RAY	Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
L655119	u8909	m606	GLORIA	So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
L655117	u8914	m606	RAY	The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
L655116	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
L655115	u8914	m606	RAY	They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
L655114	u8914	m606	RAY	Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
L655113	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Unless what?
L655112	u8914	m606	RAY	I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
L655111	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
L655110	u8914	m606	RAY	Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
L655107	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Lombardo's settlement?
L655106	u8914	m606	RAY	You saw the news today?
L654954	u8914	m606	RAY	It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
L654953	u8909	m606	GLORIA	That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
L654952	u8909	m606	GLORIA	You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
L654951	u8914	m606	RAY	This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
L654950	u8909	m606	GLORIA	The skinny brunette.
L654949	u8914	m606	RAY	You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
L654947	u8914	m606	RAY	Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
L654946	u8909	m606	GLORIA	You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
L654942	u8909	m606	GLORIA	All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
L654941	u8914	m606	RAY	You're telling me you believe the guy?
L654940	u8909	m606	GLORIA	We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
L654936	u8914	m606	RAY	Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
L654935	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
L654851	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
L654850	u8914	m606	RAY	It's our job, Gloria.
L654845	u8909	m606	GLORIA	All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
L654844	u8914	m606	RAY	That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
L654692	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Back to the land of grownups.
L654691	u8914	m606	RAY	I've got that two o'clock in town.
L655003	u8918	m606	SUZIE	"He said, ""No little bitch can ever make me come."""
L655002	u8909	m606	GLORIA	What was that?
L655001	u8918	m606	SUZIE	He did say something.
L654999	u8918	m606	SUZIE	No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
L654998	u8909	m606	GLORIA	At that point were you able to fight him off?
L654987	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I guess.
L654986	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Did he come in with you?
L654985	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Yes.
L654984	u8909	m606	GLORIA	So you were alone.
L654983	u8918	m606	SUZIE	No.
L654982	u8909	m606	GLORIA	And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
L654981	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Yeah.
L654980	u8909	m606	GLORIA	He dropped Jimmy off first?
L654979	u8918	m606	SUZIE	About a year ago.
L654978	u8909	m606	GLORIA	We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
L654977	u8918	m606	SUZIE	You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
L654974	u8909	m606	GLORIA	Why is that?
L654973	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Yeah, maybe, a little.
L654972	u8909	m606	GLORIA	That bothers you?
L654848	u8910	m606	HUNTER	I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
L654847	u8909	m606	GLORIA	You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
L654846	u8910	m606	HUNTER	I want a full-scale investigation.
L654843	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
L654842	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Where's this coming from?
L654841	u8909	m606	GLORIA	That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
L654838	u8909	m606	GLORIA	I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
L654837	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Why?
L655362	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
L655361	u8914	m606	RAY	The teeth, were they...
L655359	u8914	m606	RAY	She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
L655358	u8910	m606	HUNTER	You didn't cuff her?
L655357	u8914	m606	RAY	I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
L655356	u8914	m606	RAY	Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
L655355	u8910	m606	HUNTER	She bit you?
L655353	u8914	m606	RAY	I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
L655352	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Just tell us what happened.
L655351	u8914	m606	RAY	I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
L655293	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
L655292	u8914	m606	RAY	Kelly's next, Gloria.
L655209	u8914	m606	RAY	You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
L655208	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Oh, Ray... no...
L655204	u8914	m606	RAY	I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
L655203	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
L655202	u8914	m606	RAY	"You heard Kelly say ""Sam.""  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls..."
L655201	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Are you crazy, Ray?
L654934	u8910	m606	HUNTER	And what do they say?
L654933	u8914	m606	RAY	We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
L654932	u8910	m606	HUNTER	What about witnesses?
L654931	u8914	m606	RAY	Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
L654840	u8910	m606	HUNTER	The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
L654839	u8914	m606	RAY	Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
L655037	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Your Honor... Please...
L655036	u8918	m606	SUZIE	He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
L655026	u8910	m606	HUNTER	I'm sorry?
L655025	u8918	m606	SUZIE	This wasn't my idea.
L655024	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
L655023	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I said he did.
L655022	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Ms. Toller?
L655020	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
L655019	u8910	m606	HUNTER	I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
L655018	u8918	m606	SUZIE	He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
L654997	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
L654996	u8910	m606	HUNTER	Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
L654995	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
L654994	u8910	m606	HUNTER	What did you do then?
L654991	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I wanna go home now.
L654990	u8910	m606	HUNTER	And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
L654989	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Yeah... okay... he did
L654988	u8910	m606	HUNTER	You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
L654711	u8911	m606	JIMMY	Yeah.  But I got my bike.
L654710	u8916	m606	SAM	A ride.  You want one?
L654709	u8911	m606	JIMMY	What?
L654708	u8916	m606	SAM	What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
L654700	u8916	m606	SAM	Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
L654699	u8911	m606	JIMMY	You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
L654674	u8911	m606	JIMMY	Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
L654673	u8916	m606	SAM	Thank you, Jimmy.
L654672	u8911	m606	JIMMY	No!
L654671	u8916	m606	SAM	Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
L655277	u8911	m606	JIMMY	Yeah, but...
L655276	u8914	m606	RAY	Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
L655275	u8911	m606	JIMMY	No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
L655274	u8914	m606	RAY	I say something funny?
L655273	u8914	m606	RAY	Lombardo ever come out here?
L655272	u8911	m606	JIMMY	Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
L655271	u8914	m606	RAY	You and Suzie used to come out here together?
L655270	u8911	m606	JIMMY	It's those rocks, up there.
L655235	u8912	m606	KELLY	Shit.
L655234	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I wanna live at the beach someday.
L655233	u8912	m606	KELLY	I think we just need to get wasted.
L655232	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I thought we were goin' to a movie.
L655231	u8912	m606	KELLY	Nothing.
L655230	u8918	m606	SUZIE	What are you looking at?
L655229	u8918	m606	SUZIE	What brain?
L655228	u8912	m606	KELLY	Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
L655195	u8912	m606	KELLY	Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
L655194	u8918	m606	SUZIE	You are.
L655193	u8912	m606	KELLY	Oh, for Christ's sake.
L655192	u8918	m606	SUZIE	You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
L655174	u8912	m606	KELLY	You can trust me.
L655173	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
L655172	u8912	m606	KELLY	I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
L655145	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
L655144	u8912	m606	KELLY	Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
L655143	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
L655142	u8912	m606	KELLY	Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
L655253	u8914	m606	RAY	I'm not on your property!
L655252	u8912	m606	KELLY	Get off my property.
L655138	u8912	m606	KELLY	Police -- God -- get a life.
L655137	u8914	m606	RAY	Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
L655136	u8914	m606	RAY	I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
L655135	u8912	m606	KELLY	You're out of your mind.
L655134	u8914	m606	RAY	The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
L655133	u8914	m606	RAY	You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
L655132	u8912	m606	KELLY	Excuse me?
L655130	u8912	m606	KELLY	About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
L655129	u8914	m606	RAY	Curiosity, I guess.
L655128	u8912	m606	KELLY	Is there some reason why you're here?
L655269	u8912	m606	KELLY	A friend of mine bought a boat.
L655268	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Where, the mall?
L655267	u8912	m606	KELLY	Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
L655266	u8917	m606	SANDRA	I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
L655265	u8912	m606	KELLY	You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
L654802	u8912	m606	KELLY	Yes.  God, Mom...
L654801	u8917	m606	SANDRA	He... Sam Lombardo?
L654800	u8912	m606	KELLY	I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
L654799	u8917	m606	SANDRA	What?
L654794	u8917	m606	SANDRA	He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
L654793	u8912	m606	KELLY	No you don't.
L654792	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
L654791	u8912	m606	KELLY	I miss Dad.
L654790	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Kelly.  What is it?
L654788	u8912	m606	KELLY	No thanks to you.
L654787	u8917	m606	SANDRA	I would hardly say you look like trash.
L654786	u8912	m606	KELLY	My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
L654785	u8912	m606	KELLY	You notice my new jumper?
L654784	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Okay, what's the matter?
L654783	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Whichever one I want.
L654782	u8912	m606	KELLY	"Which one of your ""bodyguards"" is that?"
L654720	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Sam!  Hi!
L654719	u8912	m606	KELLY	Hi, Mon.
L654718	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Is that Sam Lombardo?
L655455	u8912	m606	KELLY	Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
L655454	u8916	m606	SAM	You think that's wise?
L655453	u8912	m606	KELLY	I'm running away.
L655441	u8912	m606	KELLY	No little girl can ever make me come.
L655440	u8916	m606	SAM	I love you.  Now give me the line.
L655439	u8912	m606	KELLY	Say you love me.
L655438	u8916	m606	SAM	That's not your line.
L655437	u8912	m606	KELLY	That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
L655319	u8912	m606	KELLY	Okay.  I love you too.
L655318	u8916	m606	SAM	So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
L655317	u8912	m606	KELLY	But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
L655316	u8916	m606	SAM	Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
L655315	u8912	m606	KELLY	I don't know.  I want to see you...
L655314	u8916	m606	SAM	And you believe her?
L655313	u8912	m606	KELLY	I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
L655312	u8916	m606	SAM	Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
L655311	u8912	m606	KELLY	I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
L655310	u8916	m606	SAM	Duquette.  Forget him...
L655309	u8912	m606	KELLY	I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
L655308	u8912	m606	KELLY	God, I've been calling you.
L655307	u8916	m606	SAM	Hello.
L655306	u8912	m606	KELLY	Hello?
L655248	u8912	m606	KELLY	There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
L655247	u8916	m606	SAM	I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
L655186	u8916	m606	SAM	Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
L655185	u8912	m606	KELLY	I'm here.
L655181	u8916	m606	SAM	Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
L655180	u8912	m606	KELLY	You know what it takes.
L655179	u8916	m606	SAM	No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
L655178	u8912	m606	KELLY	Why can't you come...
L655177	u8916	m606	SAM	Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
L655176	u8912	m606	KELLY	Yes.
L655175	u8916	m606	SAM	Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
L655105	u8912	m606	KELLY	Stick?
L655104	u8916	m606	SAM	We have to stick with the plan.
L655103	u8912	m606	KELLY	Do it to ourselves?
L655102	u8916	m606	SAM	The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
L655100	u8912	m606	KELLY	Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
L655099	u8916	m606	SAM	From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
L655095	u8912	m606	KELLY	Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
L655094	u8916	m606	SAM	God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
L655089	u8916	m606	SAM	About six and a half million dollars.
L655088	u8912	m606	KELLY	How much?
L655086	u8912	m606	KELLY	So you got my mom's money.
L655085	u8916	m606	SAM	Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
L655074	u8916	m606	SAM	Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
L655073	u8912	m606	KELLY	Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
L655072	u8916	m606	SAM	Kelly...
L654754	u8912	m606	KELLY	Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
L654753	u8916	m606	SAM	All right.  I'll have to look for it.
L654752	u8912	m606	KELLY	Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
L654751	u8916	m606	SAM	Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
L654750	u8912	m606	KELLY	Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
L654749	u8916	m606	SAM	So, where you off to now?
L654743	u8916	m606	SAM	In back of the garage.
L654742	u8912	m606	KELLY	Where's the hose?  We can set up.
L654740	u8916	m606	SAM	No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
L654739	u8912	m606	KELLY	Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
L654717	u8916	m606	SAM	I won't.
L654716	u8912	m606	KELLY	Don't forget the car wash.
L654706	u8912	m606	KELLY	Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
L654705	u8916	m606	SAM	Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
L655046	u8913	m606	KEN	Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
L655045	u8916	m606	SAM	Just like that?
L655044	u8913	m606	KEN	You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
L655043	u8916	m606	SAM	I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
L655042	u8913	m606	KEN	Come on, let loose!
L654899	u8913	m606	KEN	Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
L654898	u8916	m606	SAM	I just want my life back...
L654897	u8913	m606	KEN	Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
L654896	u8916	m606	SAM	There's nothing for them to get.
L654895	u8913	m606	KEN	Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
L654894	u8916	m606	SAM	Nellie Gail Ranch...
L654893	u8913	m606	KEN	For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
L654892	u8916	m606	SAM	What's that supposed to mean?
L654891	u8913	m606	KEN	You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
L654890	u8913	m606	KEN	Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
L654889	u8916	m606	SAM	Can't you take that stupid thing off?
L654888	u8916	m606	SAM	I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
L654887	u8913	m606	KEN	Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
L654886	u8916	m606	SAM	Forget it.
L654885	u8913	m606	KEN	You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
L654884	u8916	m606	SAM	Good thinking.
L654868	u8916	m606	SAM	Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
L654867	u8913	m606	KEN	But check this...
L655350	u8914	m606	RAY	Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
L655349	u8917	m606	SANDRA	You can't...
L655348	u8914	m606	RAY	I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
L655347	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
L655346	u8914	m606	RAY	Where is she?
L655345	u8914	m606	RAY	Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
L655344	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Who is it?
L654805	u8917	m606	SANDRA	That's right.
L654804	u8914	m606	RAY	You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
L655406	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
L655405	u8914	m606	RAY	Sam, for godsake.
L655402	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
L655401	u8914	m606	RAY	You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
L655168	u8914	m606	RAY	That's right.  That was his name.
L655167	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Davy.
L655164	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Shut up.
L655163	u8914	m606	RAY	Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
L655162	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Get away from me.
L655159	u8914	m606	RAY	Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
L655158	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
L655157	u8914	m606	RAY	Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
L655156	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
L655155	u8914	m606	RAY	You, Kelly, Sam.
L655154	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
L655153	u8914	m606	RAY	Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
L655152	u8918	m606	SUZIE	About what?
L655151	u8914	m606	RAY	Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
L655150	u8918	m606	SUZIE	That's cop bullshit.
L655149	u8914	m606	RAY	Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
L655148	u8918	m606	SUZIE	You got something against cigarettes?
L655147	u8914	m606	RAY	You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
L654971	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
L654970	u8914	m606	RAY	It doesn't look like it.
L654969	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Will they?
L654968	u8914	m606	RAY	No.
L654966	u8914	m606	RAY	So Suzie, you called us, remember?
L654965	u8918	m606	SUZIE	It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
L654963	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I did.  At Blue Balls.
L654962	u8914	m606	RAY	Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
L655397	u8916	m606	SAM	Come off it, man... It was an accident.
L655396	u8914	m606	RAY	That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
L655395	u8916	m606	SAM	Jesus, man... You okay?
L655394	u8914	m606	RAY	Yeah, or get me drowned.
L655393	u8916	m606	SAM	Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
L655392	u8914	m606	RAY	I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
L655391	u8916	m606	SAM	Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
L655390	u8914	m606	RAY	You mean this thing?
L655373	u8916	m606	SAM	Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
L655372	u8914	m606	RAY	Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
L655371	u8916	m606	SAM	Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
L655370	u8914	m606	RAY	Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
L655369	u8914	m606	RAY	The bitch shot me, is what happened.
L655368	u8916	m606	SAM	Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
L654925	u8914	m606	RAY	Sit down, Lombardo.
L654924	u8916	m606	SAM	Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
L654923	u8914	m606	RAY	With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
L654922	u8916	m606	SAM	It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
L654921	u8914	m606	RAY	But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
L654916	u8916	m606	SAM	That's right.
L654915	u8914	m606	RAY	But she ran away.
L654912	u8916	m606	SAM	Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
L654911	u8914	m606	RAY	And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
L654910	u8916	m606	SAM	I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
L654909	u8914	m606	RAY	But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
L654908	u8916	m606	SAM	Yes.
L654907	u8914	m606	RAY	And she wanted to talk.
L654906	u8916	m606	SAM	Yes.
L654905	u8914	m606	RAY	In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
L654904	u8916	m606	SAM	Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
L654903	u8914	m606	RAY	The one you bought at school.
L654902	u8916	m606	SAM	I had to go look for this coupon.
L654901	u8916	m606	SAM	Story's the same, Detective...
L654900	u8914	m606	RAY	Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
L655452	u8916	m606	SAM	I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
L655451	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
L655450	u8916	m606	SAM	How...
L655449	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
L655448	u8916	m606	SAM	We?
L655447	u8918	m606	SUZIE	I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
L655444	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
L655443	u8916	m606	SAM	Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
L655442	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
L655420	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
L655419	u8916	m606	SAM	What's wrong?
L655415	u8916	m606	SAM	That was the same thing Ray said.
L655414	u8918	m606	SUZIE	What?
L655413	u8918	m606	SUZIE	But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
L655412	u8916	m606	SAM	But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
L655411	u8918	m606	SUZIE	The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
L655410	u8916	m606	SAM	That was about as grim as it gets.
L655242	u8916	m606	SAM	No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
L655241	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Are you mad at me?
L655240	u8916	m606	SAM	I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
L655191	u8916	m606	SAM	Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
L655190	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Yeah, right.
L655188	u8916	m606	SAM	Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
L655187	u8918	m606	SUZIE	But I..
L655184	u8916	m606	SAM	Put Kelly on too.
L655183	u8918	m606	SUZIE	Sam...
L655097	u8916	m606	SAM	Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
L655096	u8918	m606	SUZIE	How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
L654778	u8916	m606	SAM	Goodbye, Sandra.
L654777	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
L654775	u8916	m606	SAM	So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
L654774	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
L654772	u8917	m606	SANDRA	To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
L654771	u8916	m606	SAM	Didn't you see her this morning?
L654770	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Shit. Here we go again.
L654769	u8916	m606	SAM	No.
L654768	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
L654767	u8916	m606	SAM	Sandy... What's up?
L654730	u8916	m606	SAM	Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
L654729	u8917	m606	SANDRA	What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
L654728	u8916	m606	SAM	Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
L654727	u8917	m606	SANDRA	I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
L654726	u8916	m606	SAM	I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
L654724	u8916	m606	SAM	Can't.  Got a passenger.
L654723	u8917	m606	SANDRA	Why don't you come in, have a drink?
L654722	u8916	m606	SAM	Hi, Sandy.
L654721	u8917	m606	SANDRA	What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
L663447	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	Please.
L663446	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What?!
L663445	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
L663444	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I would like to use the bathroom --
L663443	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
L663442	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Why?  What's the problem?
L663441	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
L663440	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
L663643	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
L663642	u8976	m612	ANALYST	We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
L663641	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	"What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter"" theory?"
L663640	u8976	m612	ANALYST	As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
L663638	u8976	m612	ANALYST	Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
L663637	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	What kind of time frame are we talking about?
L663636	u8976	m612	ANALYST	Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
L663635	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	What about our end?
L663303	u8977	m612	BURNS	They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
L663302	u8981	m612	HYDE	Washington?
L663301	u8977	m612	BURNS	He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
L663300	u8981	m612	HYDE	Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
L663299	u8977	m612	BURNS	No idea who's behind this?
L663298	u8981	m612	HYDE	You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
L663297	u8977	m612	BURNS	Had a lot of blood in him.
L663846	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
L663845	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
L663829	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	We don't know that.
L663828	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	God isn't there to do it.
L663827	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
L663826	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
L663825	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
L663824	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Who is she?  Do you know her?
L663823	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	A whore fucking.
L663779	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
L663778	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
L663777	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Wrong answers?
L663776	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
L663775	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Don't call me that.
L663774	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter --
L664176	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
L664175	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
L663366	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
L663365	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
L663363	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
L663362	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What's your theory?
L663361	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
L663360	u8990	m612	VEIDT	"Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen."
L663357	u8990	m612	VEIDT	We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
L663356	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The bearer of bad news.
L663352	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Hello, Adrian.
L663351	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Hi, Jon.
L664185	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
L664184	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
L664183	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
L664182	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon --
L664169	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Veidts complex.
L664168	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, where are we?
L664155	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The south pole.  Times flowing backwards.
L664154	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- what??
L664153	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . .
L664141	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Cured, yes.
L664140	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What -- am I --
L664139	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
L664138	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
L664137	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
L664136	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I won't do that.
L664135	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
L664134	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	You're the only human being I care for.
L664133	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
L664132	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
L664131	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, I do not want to hear it.
L664082	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
L664081	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
L664080	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
L664079	u8985	m612	LAURIE	"Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?"
L664078	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Because --
L664077	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
L664076	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Always.  Ever since the day I died.
L664075	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
L664074	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
L664073	u8985	m612	LAURIE	But you knew that I'd -- die.
L664072	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
L664071	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
L664070	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
L664069	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
L664067	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
L664066	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
L664065	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
L664064	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
L664062	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You -- you know about me and Dan?
L664061	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
L664060	u8985	m612	LAURIE	This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
L664047	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
L664046	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
L664041	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
L664040	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, no -- I can't --
L664039	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
L664038	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Collect me?
L664037	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
L663397	u8985	m612	LAURIE	. . . And just how would you manage that?
L663396	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I could stay and go.
L663395	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Mm hmm.
L663394	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Would you like me to stay?
L663392	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Not yet, there's plenty of time.
L663391	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
L663390	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm here, Laurie.
L663359	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
L663358	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Blake?  Dead?
L664172	u8990	m612	VEIDT	We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
L664171	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
L664170	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
L664165	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
L664164	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What if youre wrong??
L664163	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Im not.
L664162	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	And what if youre wrong?
L664161	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
L664150	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
L664149	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian -- you've lost it.
L664148	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
L664147	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What is it?  How does it work?
L664146	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
L664128	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
L664127	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
L664126	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
L664117	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
L664116	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What??
L664111	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
L664110	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The missing scientists.
L664109	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
L663803	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
L663802	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
L663801	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	She's with me.
L663800	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
L663799	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Who?
L663343	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Good night.
L663342	u8990	m612	VEIDT	You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
L663341	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No.  I just wanted you to --
L663340	u8990	m612	VEIDT	If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
L663339	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
L663338	u8990	m612	VEIDT	You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
L663337	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
L663336	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
L663335	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
L663334	u8990	m612	VEIDT	My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
L663333	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
L664215	u8985	m612	LAURIE	We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
L664214	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
L664213	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan -- what do we do now?
L664201	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Everything's changed --
L664200	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Those cars.  What year is this??
L664199	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, is this -- is this New York??
L664196	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Where did he go?
L664195	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He saved himself.  He changed the past.
L664179	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
L664178	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What was he doing?
L664018	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
L664017	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Welcome back, Night Owl.
L664001	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
L664000	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
L663985	u8985	m612	LAURIE	My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
L663984	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I think he's going to the john.
L663983	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What's he doing?
L663949	u8985	m612	LAURIE	. . . What??
L663948	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
L663947	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
L663946	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
L663945	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's because --
L663944	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
L663943	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Yes you are.
L663942	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
L663941	u8985	m612	LAURIE	The costumes.  Am I right?
L663940	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What?
L663923	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
L663922	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're practically on us . . .
L663921	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
L663920	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
L663915	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	All right.  Mission accomplished.
L663914	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're following us.
L663891	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
L663890	u8985	m612	LAURIE	It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
L663889	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What the hell -- ?
L663869	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Okay!
L663868	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	This'd better not be what I think it is.
L663867	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Don't look.  Turn around.
L663866	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What are you up to?
L663865	u8985	m612	LAURIE	God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
L663864	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
L663863	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
L663861	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You and me.
L663860	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
L663859	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
L663858	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Antarctica??
L663857	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
L663854	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
L663853	u8985	m612	LAURIE	The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
L663849	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Memory lane.
L663848	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
L663810	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
L663809	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
L663808	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Laurie --
L663807	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
L663806	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	-- What is it.
L663805	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
L663804	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
L663758	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
L663757	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
L663754	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
L663753	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
L663725	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
L663724	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	. . . What?
L663723	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
L663722	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Old?
L663721	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
L663720	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
L663719	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
L663718	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
L663706	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Play one.  Educate yourself.
L663705	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
L663704	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
L663697	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
L663696	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	His . . . whatever.
L663695	u8985	m612	LAURIE	His what?
L663663	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
L663662	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
L663658	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You're sure?
L663657	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
L663656	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
L663654	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
L663653	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Maybe not, but why take chances?
L663652	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
L663651	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
L663650	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
L663649	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
L663432	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
L663431	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
L663430	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
L663429	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
L663428	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
L663427	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
L663426	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Damn straight!  We were heroes.
L663425	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Damn straight.
L663420	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
L663419	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
L663418	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
L663417	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
L663416	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
L663415	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
L664160	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
L664159	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
L664108	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
L664107	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
L664106	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
L664088	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
L664087	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	What caused it?
L664086	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
L664085	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	What happened?
L664057	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
L664056	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
L664055	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	SHUT UP, Rorschach.
L664054	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Coward.  Giving up.
L664053	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
L664052	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
L664051	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
L664044	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't think she's coming with us.
L664043	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Where's Laurie?
L664024	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
L664023	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
L664022	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
L664021	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
L664020	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What do you mean, frame-up?
L664019	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
L663999	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
L663998	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What new information?
L663997	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
L663996	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
L663987	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
L663986	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	. . . That was quick.
L663327	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
L663326	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
L663325	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
L663324	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	So do I.  So do you.
L663322	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
L663321	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
L663319	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
L663318	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
L663545	u8983	m612	JON	My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
L663544	u8982	m612	JANEY	-- What?
L663543	u8983	m612	JON	I can fix it.
L663539	u8983	m612	JON	Janey, will you marry me?
L663538	u8982	m612	JANEY	Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
L663536	u8982	m612	JANEY	We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
L663535	u8983	m612	JON	Nothing.  What were you going to say?
L663534	u8982	m612	JANEY	We should get back --  What?
L663533	u8983	m612	JON	Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
L663532	u8982	m612	JANEY	Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
L663531	u8983	m612	JON	Nothing wrong with ketchup.
L663530	u8982	m612	JANEY	With lots of ketchup?
L663529	u8983	m612	JON	I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
L663787	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Isn't it true that you --
L663786	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I did not.  Now get out of my way!
L663785	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Did you know he was back on the streets?
L663784	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No comment.
L663682	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
L663681	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
L663680	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
L663679	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
L663678	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
L663599	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
L663598	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon??  You mean he's --
L663597	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
L663596	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
L663595	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
L663594	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Am I free to go?
L663593	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
L663468	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
L663467	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
L663466	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What does this mean?  What does it --
L663465	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	I'm terribly sorry.
L663464	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
L663463	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
L663462	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then why don't you ask him?!?
L663461	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	"You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --"
L663460	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know their real names!
L663459	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
L663458	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know their real names.
L663457	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Their real names, please.
L663379	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I'm sorry about Blake.
L663378	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Maybe I'll do that.
L663377	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
L663376	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
L663375	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What about you?
L663374	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
L663373	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
L663372	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
L663371	u8990	m612	VEIDT	He's a little farther gone every time.
L663370	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Please.
L663369	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
L663368	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
L663350	u8985	m612	LAURIE	He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
L663349	u8990	m612	VEIDT	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
L663348	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Don't rub it in.  I live here.
L663347	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Laurie!  Good to see you.
L663346	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Adrian.
L663671	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
L663670	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
L663629	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
L663628	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
L663627	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
L663626	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
L663622	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
L663621	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
L663620	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	You're making a big --
L663619	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
L663618	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
L664123	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
L664122	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
L664119	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
L664118	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
L664113	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
L664112	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
L663691	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
L663690	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
L663689	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
L663688	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What is that ungodly smell?
L663687	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
L663686	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Ever see one of these before?
L663685	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	New information.
